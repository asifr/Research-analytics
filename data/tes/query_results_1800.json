To further investigate this we compared the electromyographic (EMG) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during voluntary contractions of ten subjects who have been training for more than 2 years, resistance-training (RT) group, and ten subjects that have never participated in resistance training (NT). The active motor threshold for biceps brachii was obtained during voluntary elbow flexion at 10% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). TMS was also delivered at 100% of the maximal stimulator output while the participants exerted forces ranging from 10 to 90% of MVC. Evoked force, motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and latency from biceps brachii was recorded for each condition to explore changes in corticospinal excitability. The evoked force was significantly lower in the RT group in comparison with the NT group between 30 and 70% of MVC intensity (P<0.05). At 90% of MVC, nine subjects from the RT group showed an absence in the evoked force while this occurred in only five subjects from the NT group. The MEP amplitude and latency changed significantly (P<0.001) with increasing levels of contraction, without significant difference between groups. These results indicate that changes in the CNS are sustained in the log-term practices of resistance training and permit a higher voluntary activation at several intensities of the MVC.", "pages": "722-8"}, {"volume": "66", "title": "Changes in motor cortex excitability with stimulation of anterior thalamus in epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16505313", "authors": ["Molnar, GF", "Sailer, A", "Gunraj, CA", "Cunic, DI", "Wennberg, RA", "Lozano, AM", "Chen, R"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement disorders and pain.

To date, few researchers have investigated whether pain relief is possible by stimulation of cortical areas other than M1. According to recent reports, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can provide an effect similar to that of electrical stimulation. With this in mind, we therefore examined several cortical areas as stimulation targets using a navigation-guided rTMS and compared the effects of the different targets on pain. Twenty patients with intractable deafferentation pain received rTMS of M1, the postcentral gyrus (S1), premotor area (preM), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Each target was stimulated with ten trains of 10-s 5-Hz TMS pulses, with 50-s intervals in between trains. Intensities were adjusted to 90% of resting motor thresholds. Thus, a total of 500 stimuli were applied. Sham stimulations were undertaken at random. The effect of rTMS on pain was rated by patients using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Ten of the 20 patients (50%) indicated that stimulation of M1, but not other areas, provided significant and beneficial pain relief (p<0.01). Results indicated a statistically significant effect lasting for 3 hours after the stimulation of M1 (p<0.05). Stimulation of other targets was not effective. The M1 was the sole target for treating intractable pain with rTMS, in spite of the fact that M1, S1, preM, and SMA are located adjacently.", "pages": "722-8"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Structural brain alterations following 5 days of intervention: dynamic aspects of neuroplasticity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16485747", "authors": ["May, A", "Hajak, G", "G\u00e4nssbauer, S", "Steffens, T", "Langguth, B", "Kleinjung, T", "Eichhammer, P"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "The usefulness of intraoperative monitoring of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) during inhaled anesthesia is limited by the suppressive effects of volatile anesthetics on MEP signals. We investigated the effects of different stimulation patterns and end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane on intraoperative transcranial electrical MEPs. In 12 patients undergoing craniotomy, stimulation patterns (300-500 V, 100-1000 Hz, 1-5 stimuli) and multiples (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane were varied randomly while remifentanil was administered at a constant rate of 0.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). MEPs were recorded from thenar and hypothenar muscles and analyzed without knowledge of the respective MAC. Three-way analysis of variance revealed significant main effects for increasing stimulation intensity, frequency, and number of stimuli on MEP amplitude (P < 0.05). Maximum MEP amplitudes and recording success rates were observed during 4 stimuli delivered at 1000 Hz and 300 V. A significant main effect of sevoflurane concentration (0.5 versus 0.75 and 1 MAC multiple) on MEP amplitude was observed at the thenar recording site only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MEP characteristics varied significantly with changes in stimulation pattern and less so with changes in sevoflurane concentration. The results suggest that high frequency repetitive stimulation allows intraoperative use of MEP monitoring during up to 1 MAC multiple of sevoflurane and constant infusion of remifentanil up to 0.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1).", "pages": "722-8"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "Motor cortex plasticity in Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesias.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 4", "pmid": "16481564", "authors": ["Morgante, F", "Espay, AJ", "Gunraj, C", "Lang, AE", "Chen, R"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a relatively new technique that allows painless activation of cortical motor neurons.

In addition to the motor cortex, TMS can be applied to examine other structures inaccessible to electrical stimulation, such as the canalicular portion of the facial nerve. In healthy individuals, TMS can be utilized to monitor excitability changes of the motor system in various situations and muscles, providing valuable information to the understanding of the physiology of motor control. Furthermore, TMS can be used to explore interhemispheric connections as well as intracortical inhibitory and excitatory processes both in health and disease. Finally, with the help of TMS cortical maps of the representation areas of muscles can be constructed, giving insight to both short and long-term cortical plasticity and to the reorganisation of the motor cortex following damage to the brain or acquisition of new motor skills.", "pages": "722-8"}]
