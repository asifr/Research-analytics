Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of eight individuals on three separate days. The intensity of TMS at rest was varied from 5% below threshold to the maximal output of the stimulator. During trials in which the muscle was active, TMS and TES intensities were selected that elicited MEPs of between 150 and 300 microV at rest. MEPs were evoked while the participants exerted torques up to 50% of their maximum capacity. The relationship between MEP size and stimulus intensity at rest was sigmoidal (R2=0.97). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between 0.47 and 0.81 for the parameters of the sigmoid function. For the active trials, the slope and intercept of regression equations of MEP size on level of background contraction were obtained more reliably for TES (ICC=0.63 and 0.78, respectively) than for TMS (ICC=0.50 and 0.53, respectively). These results suggest that input-output parameters of the cortico-spinal pathway may be reliably obtained via transcranial stimulation during longitudinal investigations of cortico-spinal plasticity.", "pages": "193-202"}, {"volume": "141", "title": "Cutaneomotor integration in human hand motor areas: somatotopic effect and interaction of afferents.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11713634", "authors": ["Tamburin, S", "Manganotti, P", "Zanette, G", "Fiaschi, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We studied the influence of different intensities of electrical digital stimulation of two different fingers on motor-evoked potentials elicited in hand muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single conditioning electrical stimuli were applied to the right second (D2) and fifth fingers (D5) individually and also to both fingers (D2+D5) simultaneously in six normal volunteers. Magnetic tests, adjusted to produce a response in the abductor digiti minimi muscle of the right hand, were delivered using a circular and a focal coil. The digital stimuli were delivered to the finger at the sensory threshold (ST), at 3 and 5 times the ST, and over the pain threshold at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging from 10 to 100 ms. In order to define the anatomical level of the sensorimotor interactions, the effect of the digital stimulation on TMS was compared to the effect on transcranial electrical stimulation. When the peripheral stimulation was delivered at the ST a small inhibitory effect was found only when stimulating both fingers. At 3 times the ST we detected a topographic distribution of motor-evoked potential inhibition, which partially disappeared at higher intensity (5 times the ST); two types of convergence effects took place at different ISIs. When conditioning stimuli were painful, somatotopy and convergence were lost. Sensorimotor integration shows somatotopy and interaction of afferents at different sites. The intensity of the conditioning stimulus plays an important role in topography and sensory convergence. The importance of these mechanisms in physiology and physiopathology is discussed.", "pages": "193-202"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used to test connections to primary motor areas from frontal and medial cortex in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "11707100", "authors": ["Civardi, C", "Cantello, R", "Asselman, P", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2001", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Surface EMG responses (MEPs) were recorded from the relaxed first dorsal interosseous (FDI) of 16 normal subjects following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand area of the primary motor cortex. These test responses were conditioned by a subthreshold stimulus applied 2-15 ms beforehand over a range of anterior or medial sites. Stimuli applied 3-5 cm anterior to the hand motor area (site A) or 6 cm anterior to the vertex on the nasion-inion line (site B) inhibited the test responses at short latency. The largest effect was seen when the interstimulus interval was 6 ms and the intensity of the conditioning stimulus was equal to 0.9x active motor threshold (AMT) at the hand area. Increasing the intensity to 1.2x AMT produced facilitation. Suppression of surface EMG responses was mirrored in the behavior of single motor units. Conditioning stimuli had no effect on responses evoked in the active FDI muscle by transcranial electric stimulation of motor cortex nor on forearm flexor H reflexes even though MEPs in the same muscle were suppressed at appropriate interstimulus intervals. We conclude that low-intensity TMS over presumed premotor areas of frontal cortex can engage corticocortical connections to the primary motor hand area.", "pages": "193-202"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Evidence of activity-dependent withdrawal of corticospinal projections during human development.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "11706088", "authors": ["Eyre, JA", "Taylor, JP", "Villagra, F", "Smith, M", "Miller, S"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To characterize the development of ipsilateral corticospinal projections from birth and compare to 1) development of contralateral projections in the same subjects and 2) ipsilateral corticospinal projections in subjects with unilateral lesions of the corticospinal system acquired perinatally or in adulthood.", "pages": "193-202"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Cortico-cortical connectivity of the human mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and its modulation by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "11706084", "authors": ["Paus, T", "Castro-Alamancos, MA", "Petrides, M"], "year": "2001", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation excited the motor cortex, and responses were recorded bilaterally in pectoralis major, biceps brachii, and the first dorsal interosseus muscles.

The results showed a strong rTMS-related modulation of brain activity in the fronto-cingulate circuit.

A single TMS pulse, lasting less than 1 ms, can briefly disrupt the normal activity of a targeted region of the brain for tens of milliseconds, allowing the effects of disruption on specific perceptual and cognitive tasks to be measured behaviorally. Rapid, repeated pulses can disrupt activity for correspondingly longer periods. The reversibility of the effects make it possible to create 'virtual patients' who can be tested in the same way as actual patients with real brain damage in order to explore regional functional specialization. Although several aspects of TMS continue to be evaluated, such as its safety, the extent and localization of the effective region of induced electrical current, the importance of the waveform of the pulse, the configuration and positioning of the coil, its productivity has been firmly established in little more than 10 years of systematic use. Examples of the latter are given from investigations of the nature of visual phosphenes produced by TMS applied to different regions of the visual cortex in normal subjects and subjects with occipital or ocular damage in an attempt to reveal the role of visual cortex in visual awareness.", "pages": "193-202"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Anti-recurrence treatment of patients with polyposis rhinosinusitis in initial vagotonic type of the vegetative tonus].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11701150", "authors": ["Portenko, GM", "Dobrynin, KV"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Vestnik otorinolaringologii", "abstract": "We describe a pedigree in which eight individuals presented with a non-progressive disorder with onset between the ages of 12 and 50 years. It was characterized by predominantly distal, semi-continuous rhythmic myoclonus (all patients), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (all patients) and complex partial seizures (three patients). Most individuals had rarely suffered seizures and had a normal cognitive level, but three individuals with intractable seizures had mild mental retardation. The pattern of inheritance was autosomal dominant with high penetrance. We defined this disorder as autosomal dominant cortical myoclonus and epilepsy (ADCME). All patients had frontotemporal as well as generalized interictal EEG abnormalities. A neurophysiological study of the myoclonus suggested a cortical origin. Back-averaging of the data generated a series of waves with a frequency that mirrored the frequency of EMG bursts. Frequency analysis identified significant peaks with coherence between EMG and EEG, which were recorded over the contralateral rolandic area in five patients. The frequency of coherence was 8-25 Hz and phase spectra confirmed that EEG activity preceded EMG activity by 8-15 ms. In two individuals there was also significant coherence between the ipsilateral EEG and EMG, consistent with the transcallosal spread of myoclonic activity. The C-reflex at rest was enhanced and somatosensory and visual evoked potentials were of high amplitude. The resting motor threshold intensity to transcranial magnetic stimulation was significantly reduced (38%; SD +/- 7; P = 0.01) and the post-motor evoked potential silent period (101 ms; SEM +/- 10) was significantly shortened compared with the controls (137 ms; SEM +/- 18). These clinical and neuro- physiological characteristics suggest diffuse cortical hyperexcitability and high propensity for intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric cortical spread, as well as rhythmic myoclonic activity. Genome-wide linkage analysis identified a critical region spanning 12.4 cM between markers D2S2161 and D2S1897 in 2p11.1-q12.2, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.46 at Theta 0.0 for marker D2S2175. Multipoint LOD score values, reaching 3.74 around D2S2175, localize the ADCME gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 2. The exclusion of the locus for familial adult myoclonic epilepsy on chromosome 8q23.3-q24 from linkage to our family and the new localization of the responsible gene to chromosome 2cen, together with the different phenotype, define a new epilepsy syndrome. We hypothesize that the responsible gene causes cortical hyperexcitability that is widespread but particularly involves the frontotemporal circuits.", "pages": "193-202"}]
