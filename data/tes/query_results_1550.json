They had to press one of two buttons as quickly as possible after a go signal specifying both the hand to be used and the button to press. A precue preceding this signal conveyed full, partial, or no advance information (hand and/or button), such that RT shortened with increasing amount of information. We applied 1200 to 2400 pulses of 1-Hz rTMS over various cortical areas and compared the subjects' performances at various times before and after this intervention. rTMS delayed RT at two distinct phases after stimulation, one within 10 min and another with a peak at 20 to 30 min and lasting for 60 to 90 min, with no significant effects on error rates or movement time. The effect was significantly larger on left- than on right-hand responses. RT was prominently delayed over the premotor and motor cortices with similar effects across different conditions of advance information, suggesting that preparatory processes relatively close to the formation of motor output were influenced by rTMS. In contrast, the effect of rTMS over the supplementary motor area and the anterior parietal cortex varied with the amount of advance information, indicating specific roles played by these areas in integrating target and effector information. The primary motor area, especially of the left hemisphere, may take over this processing, implementing motor output based on the information processed in other areas.", "pages": "1556-73"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "TMS pulses on the frontal eye fields break coupling between visuospatial attention and eye movements.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17699696", "authors": ["Neggers, SF", "Huijbers, W", "Vrijlandt, CM", "Vlaskamp, BN", "Schutter, DJ", "Kenemans, JL"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "While preparing a saccadic eye movement, visual processing of the saccade goal is prioritized.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the FEFs 30 ms before a discrimination target was presented at or next to the target of a saccade in preparation. Results showed that the well-known enhancement of discrimination performance on locations to which eye movements are being prepared was diminished by TMS contralateral to eye movement direction. Based on the present and other reports, we propose that saccade preparatory processes in the FEF affect selective visual processing within the visual cortex through feedback projections, in that way coupling saccade preparation and visuospatial attention.", "pages": "1556-73"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "The role of spinal cord stimulation in the management of patients with brain tumors.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "17691408", "authors": ["Robaina, F", "Clavo, B"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement", "abstract": "High grade gliomas (HGG) have decreased blood flow resulting in hypoxia, limited access by chemotherapeutic agents, and reduced radiation-sensitivity. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used successfully in the treatment of pain and ischemic syndromes. The present article summarizes our investigations into the effects of SCS in patients with HGG. Before their scheduled radio-chemotherapy, 23 patients with HGG were assessed pre- and post-SCS using several evaluation techniques: (1) transcranial Doppler (TCD) for middle cerebral artery blood flow; (2) color Doppler for common carotid artery blood flow; (3) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for tumor blood flow; (4) polarographic probe technique for tumor pO2 measurement; (5) positron emission tomography (PET) for tumor glucose metabolism. Pre-SCS, the tumors were more ischemic and more hypoxic than healthy tissues. Post-SCS, there was significant: (1) increase in blood flow measured by TCD (> or =18%), color Doppler (> or =61%) and SPECT (15%), (2) increase in oxygenation and decrease (> or =45%) in percentage of hypoxic values <10 mmHg and <5 mmHg, and (3) increase (43%) in glucose metabolism. Our studies show that SCS can modify loco-regional blood flow and oxygen supply, as well as glucose-metabolism in HGG. This suggests that SCS could prove useful as an adjuvant treatment to radio-chemotherapy. These data merit further confirmatory studies.", "pages": "1556-73"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of post-stroke patients: current state and future directions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "17691387", "authors": ["Robaina, F", "Clavo, B"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is successfully being used for the treatment of several low-perfusion syndromes. The aim of this chapter is to describe the data that support the effect of SCS on CBF and the use of SCS in the treatment of stroke and cerebral low perfusion syndromes. In addition, we present our relevant studies. Since April 1995, we have assessed 49 non-stroke patients. The following parameters were measured pre- and post-stroke: (1) CBF in healthy contralateral tissue by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), (2) systolic and diastolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by transcranial Doppler, (3) blood flow quantification in the common carotid artery (CCA) by color Doppler, and (4) glucose metabolism in healthy contralateral tissue by positron emission tomography (PET). Our results showed that during cervical SCS there was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in systolic (> or =21%) and diastolic (>26%) velocity in the MCA, and CCA blood flow (> or =51%) as well as glucose metabolism (44%). We concluded that cervical SCS (cSCS) can modify CBF and brain metabolism.

Supplement", "abstract": "Functional imaging techniques have demonstrated a relationship between the intensity of tinnitus and the degree of reorganization of the primary auditory cortex. Studies in experimental animals and humans have revealed that tinnitus is associated with a synchronized hyperactivity in the auditory cortex and proposed that the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is thalamocortical dysrhythmia; hence, decreased auditory stimulation results in decreased firing rate, and decreased lateral inhibition. Consequently, the surrounding brain area becomes hyperactive, firing at gamma band rates; this is considered a necessary precondition of auditory consciousness, and also tinnitus. Synchronization of the gamma band activity could possibly induce a topographical reorganization based on Hebbian mechanisms. Therefore, it seems logical to try to suppress tinnitus by modifying the tinnitus-related auditory cortex reorganization and hyperactivity. This can be achieved using neuronavigation-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is capable of modulating cortical activity. If TMS is capable of suppressing tinnitus, the effect should be maintained by implanting electrodes over the area of electrophysiological signal abnormality on the auditory cortex. The results in the first patients treated by auditory cortex stimulation demonstrate a statistically significant tinnitus suppression in cases of unilateral pure tone tinnitus without suppression of white or narrow band noise. Hence, auditory cortex stimulation could become a physiologically guided treatment for a selected category of patients with severe tinnitus.", "pages": "1556-73"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Electrical stimulation and gene-based neuromodulation for control of medically-refractory epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17691316", "authors": ["Alexopoulos, AV", "Gonugunta, V", "Yang, J", "Boulis, NM"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement", "abstract": "The failure of available antiepileptic medications to adequately control seizures in a substantial number of patients underscores the need to develop novel epilepsy therapies. Recent advancements in technology and the success of neuromodulation in treating a variety of neurological disorders have spurred interest in exploring promising therapeutic alternatives, such as electrical stimulation and gene-based synaptic control. A variety of different stimulation approaches to seizure control targeting structures in the central or peripheral nervous system have been investigated. Most studies have been based on uncontrolled observations and empirical stimulation protocols. Today the vagus nerve stimulator is the only FDA approved adjunctive treatment for epilepsy that utilizes electrical stimulation. Other potential strategies including direct stimulation of the epileptogenic cortex and deep brain stimulation of various targets are currently under investigation. Chronically implanted devices for electrical stimulation have a variety of limitations. First, they are susceptible to malfunction and infection. Second, most systems require battery replacement. Finally, electrical stimulation is incapable of manipulating neuronal function in a transmitter specific fashion. Gene delivery to epileptogenic targets or targets implicated in regulating seizure threshold has been investigated as an alternative means of neuromodulation in animal models. In summary, positive preliminary results and the lack of alternative treatment options provide the impetus for further exploration of electrical stimulation and gene-based therapies in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Various specific targets and approaches to modulating their activity have been investigated in human studies.", "pages": "1556-73"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Brain stimulation for epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17691312", "authors": ["Theodore, WH", "Fisher, R"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement", "abstract": "Brain stimulation has been receiving increasing attention as an alternative therapy for epilepsy that cannot be treated by either antiepileptic medication or surgical resection of the epileptogenic focus. The stimulation methods include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or electrical stimulation by implanted devices of the vagus nerve (VNS), deep brain structures (DBS) (thalamic or hippocampal), cerebellar or cortical areas. TMS is the simplest and least invasive approach. However, the most common epileptogenic areas (mesial temporal structures) probably lie too deep beneath the surface of the skull for effective TMS. The efficacy of VNS in reducing the frequency or severity of seizures is quite variable and depends on many factors which are currently investigated. VNS is well-tolerated and approved in many countries. DBS is much more invasive than either TMS or VNS. Currently, a number of targets for DBS are investigated including caudate, centromedian or anterior thalamic nuclei, and subthalamic nucleus. Direct stimulation of the epileptic cortical focus is another approach to the neuromodulation in epilepsy. Finally, another line of research investigates the usefulness of implantable seizure detection devices. The current chapter presents the most important evidence on the above methods. Furthermore, other important issues are reviewed such as the selection criteria of patients for brain stimulation and the potential role of brain stimulation in the treatment of depression in epileptic patients.", "pages": "1556-73"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Somatosensory cortex stimulation for deafferentation pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17691291", "authors": ["De Ridder, D", "De Mulder, G", "Verstraeten, E", "Sunaert, S", "Moller, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

Therefore, in order to suppress pain, it seems logical to attempt to modify this deafferentation-related somatosensory cortex hyperactivity and reorganization. This can be achieved using neuronavigation-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique that is capable of modulating cortical activity.

The first studies demonstrated a statistically significant pain suppression in all patients and a clinically significant pain suppression in 80% of them.

This treatment started in 1990, and twenty-eight studies involving 271 patients have been reported so far. The patients who have been operated on were suffering from post-stroke pain (59%), trigeminal neuropathic pain, brachial plexus injury, spinal cord injury, peripheral nerve injury and phantom-limb pain. The method of stimulation was: a) epidural, b) subdural, and c) within the central sulcus. Overall, considering the difficulty in treating central neuropathic pain, trigeminal neuropathic pain and certain types of refractory peripheral pain, the electrical stimulation of M1 is a very promising technique; nearly 60% of the treated patients improved with a higher than 50% pain relief after several months of follow-up and sometimes of a few years in most reports. The mechanism of pain relief by the electrical stimulation of M1 has been under investigation. Recently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of M1 has been reported to be effective on deafferentation pain.

Supplement", "abstract": "Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) was proposed by Tsubokawa in 1991 for the treatment of post-stroke thalamic pain. Since that time, the indications have been increased and included trigeminal neuropathic pain and later other types of central and peripheral deafferentation pain. The results reported in the literature are quite good; the mean long-term success rate is 80% in facial pain and 53% in non-facial pain. Our own results are less impressive: 4 of 14 patients (28%) experienced a greater than 40% pain relief, but in 2 of them the effect faded with time. Only few minor complications have been reported. The accurate placement of the epidural electrode over the motor cortex that somatotopically corresponds to the painful area is believed to be essential for pain relief. Predictive factors included the response to pharmacological tests, the relative sparing from the disease process of the cortico-spinal tract and the sensory system, and the analgesic response achieved during the test period of MCS. A possible predictive factor might be a test of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex. MCS may act by rebalancing the control of non-nociceptive sensory inputs over nociceptive afferents at cortical, thalamic, brainstem and spinal level. In addition, it may interfere with the emotional component of nociceptive perception. Biochemical processes involving endorphins and GABA may also be implicated in the mechanism of MCS. It is time for a large multicenter prospective randomized double blind study evaluating not only the effect of MCS on pain (based on the available guidelines for assessment of neuropathic pain), but also the optimal electrode placement and stimulation parameters, and the possible relationship with the response to rTMS. New electrode design and a new generation of stimulators may help in improving the results.", "pages": "1556-73"}]
