The technology necessary to estimate AA levels in an intact animal has only recently become available. Such an investigation could yield valuable information regarding the segmental neurochemical environment. We measured the release of AAs into the rabbit lumbar spinal cord in response to sciatic nerve and transcranial stimulation with stereotaxically placed microdialysis catheters. Samples were obtained periodically during 90 minutes of continuous stimulation of either the left or right sciatic nerve, or motor cortex. Quantification of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), aspartate, glutamate, glycine, and taurine was performed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Adequate neural excitation was verified by recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) or corticomotor evoked potentials (CMEPs). Sensory activation at intensities sufficient to activate small and large diameter peripheral fibers of the ipsilateral (to the microdialysis probe) sciatic nerve produced a significant change only in segmental glycine levels. Contralateral sciatic nerve stimulation failed to evoke a significant elevation of AAs. In addition, a significant increase in the release of glycine and taurine was measured after 90 minutes of transcranial stimulation. SSEP and CMEP components repeatedly showed adequate activation of primary afferent, descending motor fiber pathways, and segmental interneuron pools during dialysis sampling. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that suprasegmental influence over peripheral afferent and motor activity may be, in part, through these amino acid neurotransmitters in the rabbit lumbar spinal cord.", "pages": "PL113-8"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Segmental release of amino acid neurotransmitters from transcranial stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "1675777", "authors": ["Simpson, RK", "Robertson, CS", "Goodman, JC"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Neurochemical research", "abstract": "The present study used microdialysis techniques in an intact rabbit model to measure the release of amino acids within the lumbar spinal cord in response to transcranial electrical stimulation.

To assess the relative contribution of peripheral and central nerve conduction properties, a concomitant recording of the fastest efferent pathways in the central and peripheral motor system was made using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex and peripheral nerve roots. This allowed the determination of the fastest downstream efferent connection times from motor cortex to lumbar motor neuron pools and to measure the fastest efferent conduction from these motor neuron pools to effector muscles in the lower leg. The sequence observed for stance stabilizing EMG responses was similar to that obtained in earlier studies with short latency (SL) and middle latency (ML) companents occurring in the stretched triceps surae muscle and long latency (LL) responses occurring in the non-stretched tibialis anterior muscle. Homologous responses were also obtained in upper leg muscles, being recruited consistently later than those in lower leg muscles across all age groups. In the short latency range two different SL1- and SL2-responses were obtained in children of all age groups as well as in adult controls. Both the SL1- and the SL2-responses showed a flat developmental profile, reaching adult values between 20 and 30 months of age which correlated with that of the fastest efferents from lumbar motor neuron pools to leg muscles, i.e. the final motor path. ML-responses showed a steeper developmental profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "PL113-8"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Motor evoked potential monitoring during neurosurgical operations on the spinal cord.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "2030825", "authors": ["Zentner, J"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Neurosurgical review", "abstract": "In order to monitor descending pathways during neurosurgical operations on the spinal cord, motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the epidural space of the spinal cord and the cauda equina following transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in a total of 40 patients. It was the aim of our study to test this invasive recording technique with regard to recordability of potentials as well as correlation to post-operative neurological conditions. In 15 of 23 patients (65.2%) intraoperative potentials were obtained from the spinal cord and in 33 of 40 patients (82.5%) they were obtained from the cauda equina. On the basis of acceptable changes in amplitudes of up to 50% at the end of the operation, 13 of 15 (86.7%) recordings from the spinal cord and 28 of 33 (84.8%) from the cauda equina correlated correctly with the post-operative motor status. At the same time, there were false positive results in 2 (13.3%) and 5 (15.2%) recordings, respectively. False negative results were not observed. Post-operative deterioration of the motor status as observed in 3 patients coincided in 2 patients with a permanent reduction in amplitudes of more than 50% of the baselines and in 1 patient with an intra-operative loss of potentials. Thus both spinal cord and cauda equina recording of MEP elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation were proven to be sensitive methods for detection of impending neurological complications.

In the first paradigm, the motor potential evoked in thenar muscles by transcranial stimulation was conditioned by median nerve stimulation at various conditioning-test intervals. At short intervals (electric: 5-12.5 ms, magnetic: 0-7.5 ms) facilitation occurred that corresponded to the H-reflex and at longer intervals (electric: 25-40 ms, magnetic: 22.5-35 ms) there was a facilitation corresponding to the LLR. Electric and magnetic stimulation resulted in a similar degree of facilitation. A second paradigm investigated the facilitation of the forearm flexor H-reflex by a cutaneo-muscular LLR elicited by radial superficial nerve stimulation and transcranial stimulation used separately or together. When electric and magnetic brain stimulation were compared, magnetic brain stimulation was followed by significant extrafacilitation but electric stimulation was not.

Fourty normal persons including 24 men and 16 women ranging in age from 24 to 55 years (mean, 32 years) participated in the study. With a transcortical electric stimulation over the motor cortex, both the conduction time to the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis and the anterior tibial muscles, and the amplitude of the muscle action potentials were recorded. F-wave studies were performed in the median and peroneal nerves. Motor spinal cord conduction velocity (SCCV) was calculated by measuring the distance from 7th cervical to 12th thoracic spinal processes and dividing by the central conduction time obtained by the motor evoked potential studies and the F-wave latencies. The results showed a motor SCCV of 63.3 +/- 8.6 (mean +/- 1 SD) m/sec in all subjects. There was no difference in male and female groups. The conduction time from the motor cortex to the target muscles was not different in both sex groups correlating to the factor of body height. From these results the conclusion was made that the estimation of motor SCCV is measurable and provides valuable data in the detection of electrophysiological function of spinal motor pathways.", "pages": "PL113-8"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Comparison of evoked electromyography of the larynx to electrical and magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex of the dog.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1 Pt 1", "pmid": "1984554", "authors": ["Haghighi, SS", "Estrem, SA"], "year": "1991", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "abstract": "The electromyographic and contractile properties of the laryngeal muscles upon stimulation of the laryngeal nerve have been described before.

All electric fields are calculated numerically. For magnetic stimulation we consider only a figure-of-eight coil. We find that magnetic stimulation produces the most focal field, while unifocal electric produces the least. Fields produced during magnetic stimulation are parallel to the head surface, while fields produced during electric stimulation have components both parallel and perpendicular to the head surface.

In this paper we report the effects of SCS on CBF as measured by two different techniques: 8 patients were studied with the 133-Xe method and 28 with the transcranial doppler sonography (TCD), in two cases both studies were performed. The aim of our study was to: 1-verify the effect of SCS on CBF, 2-compare observations made by two different methods, and 3-evaluate a possible correlation between the stimulated spinal segmental level and the modification of CBF. The results of our study confirm that SCS interacts with the mechanisms of regulation of CBF. The stimulation of different spinal cord levels in the same patient can produce different effects and such effects are reproducible. An increase of CBF is more likely to occur with the stimulation of the cervical spinal cord. In patients studied by both methods the sign of CBF changes induced by SCS was the same. Finally, in two patients the effect of SCS on CO2 autoregulation was studied with TCD. The results of such a study, although preliminary, suggest that CO2 and SCS have a competitive effect upon the mechanisms of regulation of CBF.", "pages": "PL113-8"}]
