Conference", "abstract": "Targeted transcranial stimulation with electric currents requires accurate models of the current flow from scalp electrodes to the human brain. Idiosyncratic anatomy of individual brains and heads leads to significant variability in such current flows across subjects, thus, necessitating accurate individualized head models. Here we report on an automated processing chain that computes current distributions in the head starting from a structural magnetic resonance image (MRI). The main purpose of automating this process is to reduce the substantial effort currently required for manual segmentation, electrode placement, and solving of finite element models. In doing so, several weeks of manual labor were reduced to no more than 4 hours of computation time and minimal user interaction, while current-flow results for the automated method deviated by less than 27.9% from the manual method. Key facilitating factors are the addition of three tissue types (skull, scalp and air) to a state-of-the-art automated segmentation process, morphological processing to correct small but important segmentation errors, and automated placement of small electrodes based on easily reproducible standard electrode configurations. We anticipate that such an automated processing will become an indispensable tool to individualize transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) therapy.", "pages": "5376-9"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Sensor integration of multiple tripolar concentric ring electrodes improves pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure onset detection in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23367089", "authors": ["Makeyev, O", "Ding, Q", "Kay, SM", "Besio, WG"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The method uses the wavelet transform with a fourth order Daubechies mother wavelet and a novel coefficient reduction algorithm based on cortical amplitude thresholds.

Conference", "abstract": "As epilepsy remains a refractory condition in about 30% of patients with complex partial seizures, electrical stimulation of the brain has recently shown potential for additive seizure control therapy. Previously, we applied noninvasive transcranial focal stimulation via novel tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs) on the scalp of rats after inducing seizures with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). We developed a close-loop system to detect seizures and automatically trigger the stimulation and evaluated its effect on the electrographic activity recorded by TCREs in rats. In our previous work the detectors of seizure onset were based on seizure-induced changes in signal power in the frequency range up to 100 Hz, while in this preliminary study we assess the feasibility of recording high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the range up to 300 Hz noninvasively with scalp TCREs during PTZ-induced seizures. Grand average power spectral density estimate and generalized likelihood ratio tests were used to compare power of electrographic activity at different stages of seizure development in a group of rats (n= 8). The results suggest that TCREs have the ability to record HFOs from the scalp as well as that scalp-recorded HFOs can potentially be used as features for seizure onset detection.", "pages": "5376-9"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Axon terminal polarization induced by weak uniform DC electric fields: a modeling study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23366946", "authors": ["Arlotti, M", "Rahman, A", "Minhas, P", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

In addition to somatic polarization, subthreshold membrane polarization of axon compartments can play a significant role in modulating synaptic efficacy. The aim of this study is to provide an estimation of axon terminal polarization in a weak uniform subthreshold electric field. Simulations based on 3D morphology reconstructions and simplified models indicate that for axons having long final branches compared to the local space constant (L>4\u03bb) the terminal polarization converges to E\u03bb for electric fields oriented in the same direction as the branch.

Electrode assembly design determines skin sensation and failure at the electrode can lead to skin burns. Though tDCS is generally well tolerated, the desire for rigor in electrode design is motivated by applications in increasingly diverse environments and populations. Generally the tDCS electrode assembly consists of a flat rubber or metal electrode and a saline/water saturated sponge. Here we show using FEM simulations, that each of these factors should be controlled to regulate current flow density across the skin: 1) sponge thickness 2) solution salinity 3) electrode size, 4) electrode placement in the sponge (including surface or pocket configuration) 5) control of excess fluid at the skin surface 6) use of rivets. Two general patterns of current distribution emerge as a result of integrated design: edge concentration or center concentration. Poor control over any of these electrode assembly parameters will result in unpredictable current density at the skin during tDCS.", "pages": "5376-9"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in pediatric brain: a computational modeling study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23366028", "authors": ["Minhas, P", "Bikson, M", "Woods, AJ", "Rosen, AR", "Kessler, SK"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation which uses weak electric currents applied on the scalp to modulate activity of underlying brain tissue. In addition to being used as a tool for cognitive neuroscience investigations, tDCS has generated considerable interest for use as a therapeutic modality for neurologic disorders. Though the safety and tolerability of tDCS in adults is well-established, there is little information on the safety of tDCS in children. Because there are differences between children and adults in several key parameters (such as skull thickness and cerebrospinal fluid volume) which affect current flow through the brain, special consideration should be given to the stimulation parameters which are used in a pediatric study population. In this study we present cortical electrical field maps at different stimulation intensities and electrode configurations using a high-resolution-MRI derived finite element model of a typically developing, anatomically normal 12 year old child. The peak electrical fields for a given stimulus intensity in the adolescent brain were twice as high as in the adult brain for conventional tDCS and nearly four times as high for a 4X1 High-Definition tDCS electrode configuration. These data suggest that acceptable tDCS stimulation parameters may be different in children compared to adults, and that further modeling studies are needed to help guide decisions about applied current intensity.", "pages": "5376-9"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "The relationship between transcranial current stimulation electrode montages and the effect of the skull orbital openings.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "20435146", "authors": ["Mekonnen, A", "Salvador, R", "Ruffini, G", "Miranda, PC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method for focal brain stimulation where small intracranial currents are induced by a pulsed magnetic field. TMS can be applied simultaneously with tDCS to probe brain excitability or to effect synergistic neuromodulation. Delivering TMS simultaneously with tDCS can induce electric current pulses in the tDCS electrodes even when the tDCS device is turned off or is set to 0 mA output, as long as the electrodes are connected to the tDCS current source. The output impedance of commercial tDCS devices is in the range of 2-5 k\u2126 which can allow substantial currents to be induced by TMS. In a rat TMS-tDCS setup, the induced currents are comparable to the tDCS current magnitude. To mitigate the induced currents, the area of the loop formed by the tDCS electrode leads should be minimized and the impedance of the tDCS circuit at TMS pulses frequencies (1-10 kHz) should be maximized.", "pages": "5376-9"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Effects of tissue dielectric properties on the electric field induced in tDCS: a sensitivity analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "21613470", "authors": ["Salvador, R", "Ramirez, F", "V'yacheslavovna, M", "Miranda, PC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Despite the existence of multiple studies of this kind, a wide range of different values and properties for the electrical conductivities of the tissues represented is employed. This makes it difficult to predict whether the changes observed between models are due to differences in the geometries of the volume conductors or to the different electrical properties of the tissues. In this study we used the finite element method to calculate the E-field distribution in several spherical head models whose tissues were represented with different isotropic and anisotropic conductivity profiles. Results show that the distribution of the E-field is especially sensitive to the conductivity of the skull, skin and GM.
