We retrospectively re-analyzed data collected from previous transcranial direct current stimulation studies. In women, the excitability-diminishing after-effects of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation were relevantly prolonged compared with the male group. Similarly, during a short direct current stimulation that elicits no after-effects, the female group showed more inhibition. In contrast, no significant differences between male and female study participants were found for excitability-enhancing anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. These results suggest sex differences, possibly due to the effects of sex hormones, in the modulation of human cortical plasticity.", "pages": "1703-7"}, {"volume": "157", "title": "Recovery of motor function after stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "17046674", "authors": ["Brown, JA"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "Improvement of motor activity may occur after stroke. It may be because of recovery of marginally functional neurons. It may also occur by relearning, a process that strengthens existing pathways and may lead to new functional or structural changes- neuroplasticity. Clinical investigation into the treatment of chronic pain after thalamic infarction has shown improvement in motor function when pain relief is achieved with motor cortex stimulation. More recently, laboratory studies in rats and primates demonstrate significant improvement in forelimb reaching tasks in rats and primates after induced ischemic cortical infarction when rehabilitation is paired with stimulation of the injured cortex and cortical margin at low frequency (50 Hz). Structural changes have also been observed. Dendritic density in layer V of the cortex near the lesion increases after cortical stimulation, consistent with a restorative cortical plasticity. Also, stimulation combined with rehabilitation increases the area of the injured cortex from which movements can be evoked in response to stimulation of the injured cortex in rats. Unilateral cortical stimulation reduces secondary cortical hyperexcitability in the impaired hemisphere after stroke. These findings form the basis for the first clinical study motor cortex stimulation after chronic stroke in humans. A prospective, randomized multicenter study of subthreshold motor cortical electrical stimulation during rehabilitation in patients has been completed. The eight patients entered into this study had weakness from a stroke that occurred at least four months before enrollment. Results demonstrate that the treatment is safe. In addition, there was significant improvement in upper extremity function. These improvements persisted through the 12-week follow-up assessment period after completion of stimulation and rehabilitation. Recently, non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex demonstrates improvements in hand function that persist after stimulation for at least 25 minutes. Such work represents a paradigm shift in the approach towards rehabilitation of the stroke-injured brain away from pharmacologic flooding of neuronal receptors, instead towards targeted physiologic stimulation.", "pages": "1703-7"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "The effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on dystonia: a clinical and pathophysiological approach.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17046608", "authors": ["Tyvaert, L", "Houdayer, E", "Devanne, H", "Monaca, C", "Cassim, F", "Derambure, P"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Dystonia is characterized by sustained muscle contraction, which frequently causes repetitive, twisting movements or abnormal posture. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are still unknown. Several studies did demonstrate that, although motor cortex hyperexcitability appears to be responsible for abnormal co-contraction and overflow to adjacent muscles, plasticity mechanisms and integrative sensorimotor processing are also likely to be involved in this condition. Current dystonia treatments are based on oral medication, injection of botulinum toxin and, in a low proportion of cases, bi-pallidal deep brain stimulation. However, treatment outcome is generally disappointing. A few researchers have reported the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex or the premotor cortex, with the goal of decreasing motor cortex hyperexcitability. This article reviews all studies using this technique in dystonia and discusses rTMS therapeutic impact and its possible mechanisms of action in this indication. Currently, the premotor cortex seems to be the best target for rTMS in dystonia. Rather than merely reducing the hyperexcitability of the primary motor cortex, this technique's clinical benefit seems to result from modifications in plasticity and restoration of sensorimotor integration. The corollary technique for chronic rTMS is electrical cortical stimulation. Even though this new therapeutic tool may have therapeutic promise, more studies are required to confirm it. In particular, we need to broaden our knowledge of rTMS impact on the various forms of dystonia and to optimize target localization.", "pages": "1703-7"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Theta burst stimulation does not reliably depress all regions of the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "17029949", "authors": ["Martin, PG", "Gandevia, SC", "Taylor, JL"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The excitability of the human motor cortex projecting to hand muscles can be reduced by theta burst transcranial magnetic repetitive stimulation (TBS).

Coherence in the beta-frequency band (15-35 Hz) is thought to arise from common cortical sources. Intermuscular coherence analysis is a potentially attractive tool for the investigation of motor cortical excitability changes because it is non-invasive and can be done relatively quickly. We carried out this study to test the hypothesis that intermuscular coherence analysis was able to detect cortical excitability changes in healthy subjects following transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS has been shown to increase (anodal stimulation) or decrease (cathodal stimulation) the size of the muscle potential evoked by TMS. We found that anodal tDCS caused an increase in motor evoked potential (MEP) size that was paralleled by an increase in beta-band intermuscular coherence. Similarly, the reduction in MEP size produced by cathodal tDCS was paralleled by a reduction in beta-band intermuscular coherence, while sham stimulation did not result in any change in either MEP amplitude or beta-band intermuscular coherence. The similar pattern of change observed for MEP and intermuscular coherence may indicate similar mechanisms of action, although this cannot be assumed without further investigation. These changes do suggest that at least some of the action of tDCS is on cortical networks, and that combined tDCS and intermuscular coherence analysis may be useful in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting motor cortical excitability.", "pages": "1703-7"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation in stroke rehabilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "9130680", "authors": ["Webster, BR", "Celnik, PA", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2006", "journal": "NeuroRx : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "abstract": "Early intracranial electrical stimulation studies in animals demonstrated cerebellar connectivity to brain structures involved in cognitive and emotive functions.
