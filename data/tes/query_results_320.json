Nine young (22.5 \u00b1 0.6 yr; mean \u00b1 SD) male subjects performed maximal eccentric exercise of the elbow flexor muscles until maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force was reduced by \u223c40%. TMS was performed before, 2 h after, and 2 days after exercise under Rest and Active (5% MVC) conditions with motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the biceps brachii (BB) muscle. Peripheral electrical stimulation of the brachial plexus was used to assess maximal M-waves, and paired-pulse TMS with a 3-ms interstimulus interval was used to assess changes in SICI at each time point. The eccentric exercise resulted in a 34% decline in strength (P < 0.001), a 41% decline in resting M-wave (P = 0.01), changes in resting elbow joint angle (10\u00b0, P < 0.001), and a shift in the optimal elbow joint angle for force production (18\u00b0, P < 0.05) 2 h after exercise. This was accompanied by impaired muscle strength (27%, P < 0.001) and increased muscle soreness (P < 0.001) 2 days after exercise, which is indicative of muscle damage. When the test MEP amplitudes were matched between sessions, we found that SICI was reduced by 27% in resting and 23% in active BB muscle 2 h after exercise. SICI recovered 2 days after exercise when muscle pain and soreness were present, suggesting that delayed onset muscle soreness from eccentric exercise does not influence SICI. The change in SICI observed 2 h after exercise suggests that eccentric muscle damage has widespread effects throughout the motor system that likely includes changes in motor cortex.", "pages": "e41004"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Advances and challenges in neurostimulation for headaches.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "22266412", "authors": ["Magis, D", "Schoenen, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Changes in the excitability of the cortical projections to muscles in the upper and lower limbs can be induced in the intact human by paired associative stimulation (PAS). An interstimulus interval (ISI) of 25\u00a0ms between peripheral nerve and transcranial magnetic stimuli has been found to be effective when targeting hand muscles. The optimal ISI to induce plasticity changes in the cortical projections to lower limbs is still not well established. The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to investigate the effect of PAS with four different ISIs based on the individual latency of the sensory evoked potential (SEP plus 6, 12, 18 and 24\u00a0ms) and second, to evaluate the repeatability of the established optimal ISI. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to measure changes in the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the soleus (SOL) muscle before and after the PAS interventions. Significant increases in the amplitude of SOL MEPs (88\u00a0%) were attained with an ISI of SEP latency plus 18\u00a0ms (P32\u00a0+\u00a018\u00a0ms). The PAS effect was long-lasting, input-specific and supraspinal in origin. The intraclass correlation coefficient to test the repeatability of the PAS intervention with the optimal ISI was 0.85. The results show that the excitability of cortical projections to the soleus muscle can be repeatedly increased after PAS with an optimal ISI of SEP plus 18\u00a0ms.", "pages": "e41004"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Long latency electromyographic response induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum preferentially appears during continuous visually guided manual tracking task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "22457502", "authors": ["Matsugi, A", "Iwata, Y", "Mori, N", "Horino, H", "Hiraoka, K"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "abstract": "Several studies demonstrated in experimental models and in humans synaptic plasticity impairment in some neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. Recently new neurophysiological tools, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, have been introduced in experimental and clinical settings for studying physiology of the brain and modulating cortical activity. These techniques use noninvasive transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation to modulate neurons activity in the human brain. Cortical stimulation might enhance or inhibit the activity of cortico-subcortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity, current polarity, and other stimulation parameters such as the configuration of the induced electric field and stimulation protocols. On this basis, in the last two decades, these techniques have rapidly become valuable tools to investigate physiology of the human brain and have been applied to treat drug-resistant neurological and psychiatric diseases.

Although some of these procedures have been studied extensively, sham-controlled trials are sparse and the precise mode of action of such stimulation remains largely unknown. Nonetheless, occipital nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus seem to be effective in people with chronic cluster headache, and occipital nerve stimulation is promising in chronic migraine.
