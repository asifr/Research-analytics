In the present experiments we examined the possible role of intracortical inhibitory circuits in terminating a 20% maximum isometric contraction of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) in eight healthy subjects. Subjects performed the task simultaneously with both hands and received single or pairs (at an interstimulus interval of 3 ms to evaluate short interval intracortical inhibition, SICI) of transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) via a focal coil over the motor hand area of the left hemisphere at different times before and after the onset of relaxation. The amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) following a single or a pair of TMS pulses was measured in the right FDI and plotted relative to the onset of relaxation as estimated from the surface electromyogram (EMG) of the left FDI. MEPs were larger during contraction than after relaxation whereas SICI was absent during contraction and reappeared after relaxation. We found that in all subjects, the time course of MEP changes during relaxation was closely fitted by a Boltzmann sigmoidal curve which allowed us to estimate the mean MEP amplitudes as well as the ratio of the amplitudes after single or pairs of TMS pulses (i.e.%SICI) at any time in the task. The data showed that the amplitude of MEPs to single pulse TMS had started to decline at about the same time as the onset of EMG silence. Furthermore, the size of the MEPs evoked by paired pulses decreased up to 30 ms beforehand. The latter suggests that an increase in SICI occurs prior to the onset of MEP changes, and hence that increased cortical inhibition may play a role in suppressing corticospinal excitability during relaxation. A subsidiary experiment showed that the time relations of changes in SICI and MEP were unchanged by a period of 10 min training on the task.", "pages": "685-95"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Influence of repetitive hand movements on intracortical inhibition.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "4029300", "authors": ["Schubert, M", "Kretzschmar, E", "Waldmann, G", "Hummelsheim, H"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Repetitive movements have been reported to induce task-specific changes of intracortical inhibition and facilitation, but the mechanism operating shortly after hand movement is unclear. Transcranial magnetic single and paired stimuli (2 ms) were applied to 15 healthy subjects at rest and 1 s after repetitive (every 6 s) active and passive hand extensions. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from hand extensors (agonists) and flexors (antagonists). A strong overall inhibitory effect was observed after applying paired stimuli. In agonists only, active movements produced significantly larger MEPs. Inhibition, however, did not differ between active or passive movements and rest. This suggests that MEP increases produced by active movements in agonists are not caused by disinhibition, but are rather due to excitation (facilitation). This finding may also have implications for future studies evaluating the preferential activation of target muscles in physiotherapy.", "pages": "685-95"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Motor excitability and motor behaviour after modafinil ingestion--a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "12807989", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Allstadt-Schmitz, J", "Weiller, C"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Modafinil is a novel vigilance-enhancing agent.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was employed to test intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, the cortical silent period and to obtain stimulus-response curves. In addition, M responses and F waves were recorded. Reaction time tasks, the nine-hole-peg test and the d2 attention test were also applied. These studies were performed prior to and 3 and 24 hours after drug ingestion. Modafinil did not change excitatory or inhibitory properties in the motor cortex. It did not alter corticospinal excitability and alpha motoneuronal excitability.

An increase in high frequency oscillatory activity in the beta and gamma frequency ranges is closely related in time to the N70 peak of the primary visual evoked potential (VEP), which is an early sensory component of visual activation. Therefore this potential can be used to observe tDCS-induced changes related to oscillatory activity. VEPs were recorded using sinusoidal luminance gratings in an on/off mode before, immediately after and 10, 20, 30 min after the end of 10 min anodal or cathodal stimulation. Cathodal stimulation significantly decreased while anodal stimulation slightly increased the normalized beta and gamma frequency powers. We have shown here that tDCS transiently and reversibly changed the organized cortical activity elicited by visual stimulation.

To pursue this we increased or decreased the excitability of MT+/V5, primary motor, and primary visual cortex by the application of 7 min of anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy human subjects while they were performing a visuomotor tracking task involving hand movements. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased specifically during and immediately after cathodal stimulation, which decreases cortical excitability, only when V5 was stimulated. None of the other stimulation conditions affected visuomotor performance. We propose that the improvement in performance caused by cathodal tDCS of V5 is due to a focusing effect on to the complex motion perception conditions involved in this task. This hypothesis was proven by additional experiments: Testing simple and complex motion perception in dot kinetograms, we found that a diminution in excitability induced by cathodal stimulation improved the subject's perception of the direction of the coherent motion only if this was presented among random dots (complex motion perception), and worsened it if only one motion direction was presented (simple movement perception). Our data suggest that area V5 is critically involved in complex motion perception and identification processes important for visuomotor coordination.

The threshold magnetic field strength necessary to elicit a visual percept is often regarded as a measure of electrical excitability of visual cortex. Using single-pulse TMS during visual motion stimulus presentation, we investigated the relationship between different degrees of visual cortical preactivation and cortical phosphene threshold (PT). The two possible, mutually exclusive, predictions on the outcome of this experiment were that a) PT increases with stronger preactivation because of a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, or b) that PT decreases with increased preactivation because of the increase in neuronal response towards some threshold. PTs for single-pulse stimulation of the occipital lobe were determined for eight subjects while they passively viewed a horizontally drifting luminance-modulated sinewave grating. Gratings used were of four different luminance contrasts while the spatial and temporal frequencies remained constant. PTs were shown to increase significantly as the background grating increased in contrast. These results suggest that the neural activity underlying the perception of a phosphene can be considered a type of signal that can be partially masked by another signal, in this case the visual cortical activation produced by passive viewing of drifting gratings.", "pages": "685-95"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Comment on \"Neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with tinnitus: a short case series\".", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "11081823", "authors": ["Plewnia, C", "Kammer, T", "Gerloff, C"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Most of our knowledge about gonadal steroid effects on the nervous system come from studies of limbic structures, while virtually nothing is known about the action of these hormones on the motor system.

The motor cortex was excited by focal transcranial magnetic stimuli and the evoked responses from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) were recorded with surface electromyographic electrodes. In some experiments, the threshold and recruitment curve of the soleus H reflex were determined to assess the gonadal steroid effects on spinal motoneurones. All the subjects showed a significant decrease of cortical motor threshold concomitant with a significant increase of testosterone and oestradiol plasma concentrations. By contrast, there was no significant change of the slope of the curve expressing the relationship between the intensity of magnetic stimulation and the size of the muscle response. Both the threshold and slope of the H reflex were unaffected by the gonadal steroid levels. Latencies of the maximal FDI response to cortical and cervical magnetic stimulation were also unmodified.
