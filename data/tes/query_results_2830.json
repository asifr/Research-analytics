We used the temporal resolution of repetitive TMS (rTMS) to isolate the contributions of the left and right PPC and FEF to the planning and execution of rightward reading saccades. We present eye-movement data collected during text reading, which involves the initiation and maintenance of a series of saccades (scanpath). rTMS over the left but not right PPC slowed reading speeds for the whole array of words, indicating that this area is involved throughout the scanpath. rTMS over the right but not the left FEF slowed the time to make the first saccade, but only when triggered before the stimuli appeared, demonstrating that the role of this region is in the preparation of the scanpath. Our results are compatible with the hypotheses that the left PPC maintains reading saccades along a line of text while the right FEF is involved in the preparation of the motor plan for the scanpath at the start of each new line of text.", "pages": "918-23"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "[Effect of noninvasive transcranial electrostimulation on fatigue and related psychophysiological indices in humans].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11544866", "authors": ["Lebedev, VP", "Kovalevski\u012d, AV", "Gazeeva, IV", "Ga\u012dsina, AV", "Derpgol'ts, SV", "Bord, EI"], "year": "", "journal": "Fiziologiia cheloveka", "abstract": "The primary motor cortex produces motor commands that include encoding the direction of movement. Excitability of the motor cortex in the reaction time (RT) task can be assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To elucidate the timing of the increase in cortical excitability and of the determination of movement direction before movement onset, we asked six right-handed, healthy subjects to either abduct or extend their right thumb after a go-signal indicated the appropriate direction. Between the go-signal and movement onset, single TMS pulses were delivered to the contralateral motor cortex. We recorded the direction of the TMS-induced thumb movement and the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the abductor pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis brevis muscles. Facilitation of MEPs from the prime mover, as early as 200 ms before the end of the reaction time, preceded facilitation of MEPs from the nonprime mover, and both preceded measurable directional change. Compared with a control condition in which no voluntary movement was required, the direction of the TMS-induced thumb movement started to change in the direction of the intended movement as early as 90 ms before the end of the RT, and maximum changes were seen shortly before the end of reaction time. Movement acceleration also increased with maxima shortly before the end of the RT. We conclude that in concentric movements a change of the movement direction encoded in the primary motor cortex occurs in the 200 ms prior to movement onset, which is as early as increased excitability itself can be detected.", "pages": "918-23"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "Time course of determination of movement direction in the reaction time task in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "11535669", "authors": ["Sommer, M", "Classen, J", "Cohen, LG", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new therapeutic tool in the treatment of affective disorders but only few studies on its safety exist.

Recent work combining TMS with imaging is showing the method for future advances. In the area of TS, TMS has already had a significant impact; 3 studies have hinted that TS patients have a deficient inhibitory system. Other investigators are exploring whether TMS might be used in a therapeutic manner to alter the behavior of dysfunctional circuits.

While much research has concentrated on impaired attention to targets contralateral to sites of brain damage, here we report the ipsilateral enhancement of visual attention after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of parietal cortex at parameters known to reduce cortical excitability. Normal healthy subjects received rTMS (1 Hz, 10 mins) over right or left parietal cortex. Subsequently, detection of visual stimuli contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere was consistently impaired when stimuli were also present in the opposite hemifield, mirroring the extinction phenomenon commonly observed in neglect patients. Additionally, subjects' attention to ipsilateral targets improved significantly over normal levels.
