Animal models of TBI demonstrated that impaired learning was related to persistent synaptic plasticity suppression in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). In humans, single and repeated concussive injuries lead to lifelong and cumulative enhancements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, which is known to suppress LTP/LTD plasticity. To test the hypothesis that increased GABAergic inhibition after repeated concussions suppresses LTP/LTD and contributes to learning impairments, we used a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol to induce LTP/LTD-like effects in primary motor cortex (M1) jointly with an implicit motor learning task (serial reaction time task, SRTT). Our results indicate that repeated concussions induced persistent elevations of GABA(B)-mediated intracortical inhibition in M1, which was associated with suppressed PAS-induced LTP/LTD-like synaptic plasticity. This synaptic plasticity suppression was related to reduced implicit motor learning on the SRTT task relative to normal LTP/LTD-like synaptic plasticity in unconcussed teammates. These findings identify GABA neurotransmission alterations after repeated concussions and suggest that impaired learning after multiple concussions could at least partly be related to compromised GABA-dependent LTP/LTD synaptic plasticity.", "pages": "112-21"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "CB1 receptor antagonism/inverse agonism increases motor system excitability in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "21571507", "authors": ["Oliviero, A", "Arevalo-Martin, A", "Rotondi, M", "Garc\u00eda-Ovejero, D", "Mordillo-Mateos, L", "Lozano-Sicilia, A", "Panyavin, I", "Chiovato, L", "Aguilar, J", "Foffani, G", "Di Lazzaro, V", "Molina-Holgado, E"], "year": "2012", "journal": "European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "CB1 receptor is highly expressed in cerebral structures related to motor control, such as motor cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum. In the spinal cord, the expression of CB1 receptors has also been observed in ventral motor neurons, interneurons and primary afferents, i.e., in the cells that may be part of the circuits involved in motor control. It is known that the antagonist/inverse agonist of CB1 receptors Rimonabant penetrates the blood-brain barrier and produces a broad range of central psychoactive effects in humans. Based on the occurrence of central effects in humans treated with Rimonabant and on the location of CB1 receptors, we hypothesized that the application of Rimonabant can also affect the motor system. We tested the effects of a single dose of 20mg of Rimonabant on the excitability of motor cortex and of spinal motor neurons in order to detect a possible drug action on motor system at cortical and spinal levels. For this purpose we use classical protocols of transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation (TMS and TES). Single and paired pulse TMS and TES were used to assess a number of parameters of cortical inhibition and cortical excitability as well as of the excitability of spinal motor neurons. We demonstrated that a single oral dose of 20mg of Rimonabant can increase motor system excitability at cortical and spinal levels. This opens new avenues to test the CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists for the treatment of a number of neurological dysfunctions in which can be useful to increase the excitability levels of motor system. Virtually all the disorders characterized by a reduced output of the motor cortex can be included in the list of the disorders that can be treated using CB1 antagonists/reverse agonists (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, fatigue syndromes, parkinsonisms, etc.).", "pages": "112-21"}, {"volume": "377", "title": "Stroke rehabilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9778", "pmid": "21571152", "authors": ["Langhorne, P", "Bernhardt, J", "Kwakkel, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Lancet", "abstract": "Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling global health-care problem, and rehabilitation is a major part of patient care.

Reach adaptation in force fields has generalization patterns that suggest primary engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the intrinsic coordinates of joints and muscles, and lesser engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the extrinsic coordinates of the task. Among the cortical motor areas, the intrinsic coordinate system is most prominently represented in the primary sensorimotor cortices. Here, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to alter mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and found that when it was applied to the motor cortex, it increased generalization in intrinsic coordinates but not extrinsic coordinates. However, when tDCS was applied to the posterior parietal cortex, it had no effects on learning or generalization in the force field task.

Imaging studies performed after unilateral stimulation have shown conflicting results regarding the effects of tDCS on surrogate markers of neuronal activity. The aim of this study was to directly measure these effects on activation-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow (\u0394rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during bilateral tDCS. Nine healthy subjects underwent repeated rCBF measurements with (15)O-water and PET during a simple motor task while receiving tDCS or sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also assessed before and after real and sham stimulation. During tDCS with active movement, \u0394rCBF in M1 was significantly lower on the cathodal than the anodal side when compared with sham stimulation. This decrease in \u0394rCBF was accompanied by a decrease in MEP amplitude on the cathodal side. No effect was observed on resting or activated rCBF relative to sham stimulation. We thus conclude that it is the interaction of cathodal tDCS with activation-induced \u0394rCBF rather than the effect on resting or activated rCBF itself which constitutes the physiological imaging correlate of tDCS.", "pages": "112-21"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Early neural responses to strength training.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11180425", "authors": ["Selvanayagam, VS", "Riek, S", "Carroll, TJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "The neural adaptations that accompany strength training have yet to be fully determined. Here we sought to address this topic by testing the idea that strength training might share similar mechanisms with some forms of motor learning. Since ballistic motor learning is accompanied by a shift in muscle twitches induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) toward the training direction, we sought to investigate if these changes also occur after single isometric strength training sessions with various contraction duration and rate of force development characteristics (i.e., brief or sustained ballistic contractions or slow, sustained contractions). Twitch force resultant vectors and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by TMS were measured before and after single sessions of strength training involving the forearm muscles. Participants (n = 12) each performed three training protocols (each consisting of 4 sets of 10 repetitions) and served as their own control in a counterbalanced order. All three training protocols caused a significant (P < 0.05) shift in TMS-induced twitch force resultant vectors toward the training direction, followed by a gradual shift back toward the pretraining direction. The strongest effect was found when training involved both ballistic and sustained force components. There were no large or consistent changes in the direction of twitches evoked by motor nerve stimulation for any of the three training protocols. We suggest that these early neural responses to strength training, which share similar corticospinal changes to motor learning, might reflect an important process that precedes more long-term neural adaptation that ultimately enhance strength.", "pages": "112-21"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulator with controllable pulse parameters.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "11395017", "authors": ["Peterchev, AV", "Murphy, DL", "Lisanby, SH"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "The characteristics of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses influence the physiological effect of TMS.

This controllable pulse parameter TMS (cTMS) device can induce electric field pulses with phase widths of 10-310 \u00b5s and positive/negative phase amplitude ratio of 1-56.

Many reasons explain this heterogeneity, but one that stands out is the trial design due to specific challenges in the field. We aimed therefore to review the methodology of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) trials and provide a framework to improve clinical trial design. We performed a systematic review for randomized, controlled MDD trials whose intervention was transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in MEDLINE and other databases from April 2002 to April 2008. We created an unstructured checklist based on CONSORT guidelines to extract items such as power analysis, sham method, blinding assessment, allocation concealment, operational criteria used for MDD, definition of refractory depression and primary study hypotheses. Thirty-one studies were included. We found that the main methodological issues can be divided in to three groups: (1) issues related to phase II/small trials, (2) issues related to MDD trials and, (3) specific issues of NIBS studies. Taken together, they can threaten study validity and lead to inconclusive results. Feasible solutions include: estimating the sample size a priori; measuring the degree of refractoriness of the subjects; specifying the primary hypothesis and statistical tests; controlling predictor variables through stratification randomization methods or using strict eligibility criteria; adjusting the study design to the target population; using adaptive designs and exploring NIBS efficacy employing biological markers.
