The present study aimed to determine the specific sites of modulatory control for lengthening compared with isometric contractions. We used stimulation of the motor cortex and corticospinal tract to observe changes at the spinal and cortical levels. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary MEPs (CMEPs) were evoked in biceps brachii and brachioradialis during maximal and submaximal lengthening and isometric contractions at the same elbow angle. Sizes of CMEPs and MEPs were lower in lengthening contractions for both muscles (by approximately 28 and approximately 16%, respectively; P < 0.01), but MEP-to-CMEP ratios increased (by approximately 21%; P < 0.05). These results indicate reduced excitability at the spinal level but enhanced motor cortical excitability for lengthening compared with isometric muscle contractions.", "pages": "11-2"}, {"volume": "61", "title": "[Transcranial direct current stimulation--a new tool for human cognitive neuroscience].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19177807", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Dileone, M", "Pilato, F", "Profice, P", "Oliviero, A", "Mazzone, P", "Insola, A", "Capone, F", "Ranieri, F", "Tonali, PA"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenky\u016b no shinpo", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure of cortical stimulation, in which weak direct currents are used to polarize target brain regions. Depending on the polarity of the stimulation, tDCS can increase (anodal tDCS) or decrease (cathodal tDCS) cortical excitability in the stimulated brain regions and thereby enable the investigation of the causal relationships between brain activity and behavior. Recently, tDCS has been increasingly used to investigate human cognitive and motor functions in both healthy volunteers and neurological patients. Although tDCS generally produces diffuse cortical stimulation over a period of time, it has several advantages over other brain-stimulation tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). First, since tDCS produces less artifacts such as acoustic noise and muscle twitching, it is more suitable for double-blind, sham-controlled studies and clinical applications. Second, tDCS is not very expensive and can be performed with compact equipment, it can be easily combined with ongoing projects in neuroscience and psychology laboratories. Third, the facilitation of motor and cognitive functions by anodal tDCS may have great potential for cognitive and motor enhancement, for example, to support learning in healthy volunteers and to expedite the rehabilitation process in neurological patients. Finally, thus far, seizure incidents have not been reported in tDCS studies, tDCS has thus become a complementary tool to TMS and occupies a unique position in current cognitive neuroscience.", "pages": "11-2"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Associative motor cortex plasticity: direct evidence in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "19176639", "authors": ["Pelgrims, B", "Andres, M", "Olivier, E"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which peripheral nerve stimuli are followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex at intervals that produce an approximately synchronous activation of cortical networks, enhances the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by cortical stimulation. Indirect data support the hypothesis that the enhancement of MEPs produced by PAS involves long-term potentiation like changes in cortical synapses. The aim of present paper was to investigate the central nervous system level at which PAS produces its effects. We recorded corticospinal descending volleys evoked by single pulse TMS of the motor cortex before and after PAS in 4 conscious subjects who had an electrode implanted in the cervical epidural space for the control of pain. The descending volleys evoked by TMS represent postsynaptic activity of corticospinal neurones that can provide indirect information about the effectiveness of synaptic inputs to these neurones. PAS significantly enhanced the amplitude of later descending waves, whereas the earliest descending wave was not significantly modified by PAS. The present results show that PAS may increase the amplitude of later corticospinal volleys, consistent with a cortical origin of the effect of PAS.", "pages": "11-2"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Double dissociation between motor and visual imagery in the posterior parietal cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "19168666", "authors": ["Cohen, NR", "Cross, ES", "Tunik, E", "Grafton, ST", "Culham, JC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Because motor imagery (MI) and visual imagery (VI) are influenced differently by factors such as biomechanical constraints or stimulus size, it is conceivable that they rely on separate processes, possibly involving distinct cortical networks, a view corroborated by neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies. In the posterior parietal cortex, it has been suggested that the superior parietal lobule (SPL) underlies VI, whereas MI relies on the supramarginalis gyrus (SMG). However, because several brain imaging studies have also shown an overlap of activations in SPL and SMG during VI or MI, the question arises as to which extent these 2 subregions really contribute to distinct imagery processes. To address this issue, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce virtual lesions of either SMG or SPL in subjects performing a MI (hand drawing rotation) or a VI (letter rotation) task. Whatever hemisphere was stimulated, SMG lesions selectively altered MI, whereas SPL lesions only affected VI, demonstrating a double dissociation between MI and VI. Because these deficits were not influenced by the angular distance of the stimuli, we suggest that SMG and SPL are involved in the reenactment of the motor and visual representations, respectively, and not in mental rotation processes per se.", "pages": "11-2"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Ventral and dorsal stream contributions to the online control of immediate and delayed grasping: a TMS approach.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "19168086", "authors": ["Borich, M", "Arora, S", "Kimberley, TJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "According to Milner and Goodale's theory of the two visual streams, the dorsal (action) stream controls actions in real-time, whereas the ventral (perceptual) stream stores longer-term information for object identification. By this account, the dorsal stream subserves actions carried out immediately. However, when a delay is required before the response, the ventral (perceptual) stream is recruited. Indeed, a neuroimaging study from our lab has found reactivation of an area within the ventral stream, the lateral occipital (LO) cortex, at the time of action even when no visual stimulus was present. To tease apart the contribution of specific areas within the dorsal and ventral streams to the online control of grasping under immediate and delayed conditions, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and to LO. We show that while TMS to aIPS affected grasp under both immediate and delayed conditions, TMS to LO influenced grasp only under delayed movement conditions. The effects of TMS were restricted to early movement kinematics (i.e. within 300 ms) due to the transient nature of TMS, which was always delivered simultaneous with movement onset. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to interactions between the dorsal and ventral streams.", "pages": "11-2"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Lasting effects of repeated rTMS application in focal hand dystonia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19164853", "authors": ["Vyazovskiy, VV", "Faraguna, U", "Cirelli, C", "Tononi, G"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Focal hand dystonia (FHD) is a rare but potentially devastating disorder involving involuntary muscle spasms and abnormal posturing that impairs functional hand use.
