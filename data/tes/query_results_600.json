Anxiety disorders are the most common of all mental health problems for which effective, mechanism-based treatments remain elusive. Consequently, more advanced non-invasive therapeutic methods are required. A possible method to modulate brain activity and potentially viable for use in clinical practice is rTMS. Here, we focus on the main findings of rTMS from animal models of anxiety and the experimental advances of rTMS that may become a viable clinical application to treat anxiety disorders, one of the most common causes of disability in the workplace in the world. Key advances in combining rTMS with neuroimaging technology may aid such future developments.
