Results revealed that conscious perception of change is associated with enhanced activity in a neural network comprising the parietal (bilateral) and right dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortex. Here, by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), we unveil the causal role of the right DLPF cortex in perceiving changes. When rTMS was applied to this area, change perception was impaired as compared to left DLPF rTMS and sham stimulation. This result is important as it shows, for the first time, that conscious change perception is associated with normal activity in the right DLPF cortex. Our findings are in agreement with a recent view emphasizing the role of frontal areas, in addition to classical ventral and dorsal pathways, in visual awareness.", "pages": "2549-52"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Direct current stimulation over MT+/V5 modulates motion aftereffect in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "16", "pmid": "15538181", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Varga, ET", "Nitsche, MA", "Chadaide, Z", "Paulus, W", "Kov\u00e1cs, G", "Vidny\u00e1nszky, Z"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "While there is strong evidence for the central role of the human MT+/V5 in motion processing, its involvement in motion adaptation is still the subject of debate. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to test whether MT+/V5 is part of the neural network involved in the long-term adaptation-induced motion after-effect in humans. It was found that both cathodal and anodal stimulation over MT+/V5 resulted in a significant reduction of the perceived motion after-effect duration, but had no effect on performance in a luminance-change-detection task used to determine attentional load during adaptation. Our control experiment excluded the possibility that the observed MT+/V5 stimulation effects were due to a diffused modulation of the early cortical areas, i.e. by the stimulation applied over MT+/V5. These results provide evidence that external modulation of neural excitability in human MT+/V5 affects the strength of perceived motion after-effect and support the involvement of MT+/V5 in motion adaptation processes.", "pages": "2549-52"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Immediate and long-term changes in corticomotor output in response to rehabilitation: correlation with functional improvements in chronic stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15537994", "authors": ["Koski, L", "Mernar, TJ", "Dobkin, BH"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of the corticomotor pathways might reflect and predict functional improvements during rehabilitation of a hemiparetic upper extremity. Ten patients with variable levels of functional impairment in upper extremity use were enrolled at least 3 months after a stroke. TMS was used to obtain serial measures of motor thresholds and motor-evoked potential (MEP) size for a muscle from both hands before and after each session of an intervention aimed at improving functional motor control. Functional ability and cortical map area and volume were measured before each therapy session. At intake, all TMS measures from the affected side were impaired compared with the unaffected side but they did not reliably predict the level of functional improvement. Motor thresholds decreased, whereas MEP amplitude and map size increased with treatment. The amount of change in affected side measures was correlated with the amount of improvement in hand/arm function. Normalization of MEP amplitude asymmetry in response to the 1st 2 therapy sessions predicted long-term improvement in Fugl-Meyer motor score. Within limits, TMS appears to be useful in both moderate and more impaired patients as a physiological assay of treatment-induced plasticity and behavioral gains.

Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the leg area of the motor cortex (MCx) was used to determine the time course of changes in motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) during the reaction time (RT). In one condition the voluntary contraction was superimposed on tonic EMG activity maintained at 10% of maximal voluntary contraction. In the other condition the voluntary contraction was made starting from rest. MEPs in the TA contralateral to the stimulation coil were evoked at various times during the RT in each condition. These were compared to the control MEPs evoked during tonic voluntary activity or with the subject at rest. The RT was measured trial by trial from the EMG activity of the TA ipsilateral to the magnetic stimulus, taking into account the nearly constant time difference between the two sides. The MEPs became far greater than control MEPs during the RT (mean = 332%, SD = 44 %, of control MEPs, P < 0.001) without any measurable change in the background level of EMG activity. The onset of this facilitation occurred on average 12.80 ms (SD = 7.55 ms) before the RT. There was no difference in the onset of facilitation between the two conditions. Because MEPs were facilitated without a change in the background EMG activity, it is concluded that this facilitation is specifically due to an increase of MCx excitability just before voluntary muscle activation. This conclusion is further reinforced by the observation that MEPs evoked by near-threshold anodal stimuli to the MCx were not facilitated during the RT, in contrast to those evoked by near-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, several observations in the present and previous studies indicate that MEP amplitude may be more sensitive to alpha-motoneuron activity than to motor cortical neuron activity, an idea that has important methodological implications.", "pages": "2549-52"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "TMS induced plasticity in human cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15526550", "authors": ["Ziemann, U"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Reviews in the neurosciences", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (RTMS) is a novel, non-invasive and painless technique to stimulate the human brain with the intent to alter excitability or function of the stimulated cortex or its connections.

Periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) not only facilitate the consolidation of declarative memories, but in humans, SWS is also accompanied by a pronounced endogenous transcortical DC potential shift of negative polarity over frontocortical areas. To experimentally induce widespread extracellular negative DC potentials, we applied anodal tDCS (0.26 mA) [correction] repeatedly (over 30 min) bilaterally at frontocortical electrode sites during a retention period rich in SWS. Retention of declarative memories (word pairs) and also nondeclarative memories (mirror tracing skills) learned previously was tested after this period and compared with retention performance after placebo stimulation as well as after retention intervals of wakefulness. Compared with placebo stimulation, anodal tDCS during SWS-rich sleep distinctly increased the retention of word pairs (p < 0.005). When applied during the wake retention interval, tDCS did not affect declarative memory. Procedural memory was also not affected by tDCS. Mood was improved both after tDCS during sleep and during wake intervals. tDCS increased sleep depth toward the end of the stimulation period, whereas the average power in the faster frequency bands (,alpha, and beta) was reduced. Acutely, anodal tDCS increased slow oscillatory activity <3 Hz. We conclude that effects of tDCS involve enhanced generation of slow oscillatory EEG activity considered to facilitate processes of neuronal plasticity. Shifts in extracellular ionic concentration in frontocortical tissue (expressed as negative DC potentials during SWS) may facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories.", "pages": "2549-52"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Preconditioning with transcranial direct current stimulation sensitizes the motor cortex to rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation and controls the direction of after-effects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "15522246", "authors": ["Lang, N", "Siebner, HR", "Ernst, D", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Lemon, RN", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Rapid-rate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can produce a lasting increase in cortical excitability in healthy subjects or induce beneficial effects in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders; however, the conditioning effects of rTMS are often subtle and variable, limiting therapeutic applications.
