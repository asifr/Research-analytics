Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Phosphenes represent a perceptual effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or electric stimulation of visual cortical areas. One likely neural basis for the generation of static phosphenes is the primary visual cortex (V1) although evidence is controversial. A peculiar feature of V1 is that it has sparse callosal connections with the exception of a central portion of visual field representation. In contrast, visually responsive cortical areas in the parietal lobe have widespread callosal connections. Thus, interhemispheric transfer (IT) time of off-centre phosphenes should be slower when generated by V1 than by visual parietal areas. To verify this possibility, in Exp. 1 we measured IT of phosphenes generated by TMS applied to V1 and in Exp. 2 we measured IT of phosphenes obtained by TMS applied to posterior parietal cortex. In both experiments, we obtained static bright circular phosphenes appearing in the contralateral hemifield. We measured IT time behaviorally by comparing unimanual simple reaction time to the onset of a phosphene under crossed or uncrossed hemifield-hand condition (Poffenberger paradigm). In keeping with our prediction, we found a substantially longer IT time for V1 than for parietal phosphenes. Additionally, an IT similar to that obtained with V1 stimulation was found when participants were asked to imagine the phosphenes previously experienced during TMS. In conclusion, the present results suggest that IT of phosphenes either generated by V1 TMS or imagined is subserved by slower callosal channels than those of real visual stimuli or parietal phosphenes.", "pages": "431-41"}, {"volume": "174", "title": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and computed electric field strength reduce stimulator-dependent differences in the motor threshold.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18662721", "authors": ["Danner, N", "Julkunen, P", "K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, M", "S\u00e4is\u00e4nen, L", "Nurkkala, J", "Karhu, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "The motor threshold (MT) is a fundamental parameter for evaluating cortical excitability in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) despite remarkable variation, both within, and between subjects. We intended to test whether the variation could be reduced by targeting the stimulation on-line and modeling the TMS-induced electric field on individual MR images. Navigated TMS was used to map the primary motor cortex for the representation area of the thenar muscles (abductor pollicis brevis) and to determine the MT. Thirteen healthy subjects participated in the study. To determine the between-subject variation, the MTs of nine subjects were measured with two different stimulators (comparison study). To study the individual variation, the MT measurement was repeated 20 times in four subjects always using the same stimulator (longitudinal study). In the comparison study, the MTs differed significantly between the two stimulators over all subjects (p<0.001), whereas the electric field strengths did not exhibit significant difference between the stimulators. Both, the MTs, and the electric field strengths showed similar variations, which were greater between subjects (comparison study) than within subjects (longitudinal study). In the comparison study, the distance between the locations of the two different coils on the scalp was significantly greater than the distance between the induced electric field maxima in the brain (p<0.001). We conclude that on-line navigation can be used to reduce the variation caused by different stimulator types and individual subject anatomy. In addition, cortical excitability can be evaluated by using computed electric field strength as well as stimulator-dependent MT.", "pages": "431-41"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Role of K ATP channels in cephalic vasodilatation induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide, nitric oxide, and transcranial electrical stimulation in the rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "18647185", "authors": ["Gozalov, A", "Jansen-Olesen, I", "Klaerke, D", "Olesen, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Headache", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to explore the role of K(ATP) channels in vasodilatation induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), nitric oxide (NO), and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in intracranial arteries of rat.", "pages": "431-41"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Rapid rate magnetic stimulation of human sacral nerve roots alters excitability within the cortico-anal pathway.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "18643896", "authors": ["Harris, ML", "Singh, S", "Rothwell, J", "Thompson, DG", "Hamdy, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society", "abstract": "Dilatation of cerebral and dural arteries causes a throbbing, migraine-like pain.

However, the physiological mechanism behind this improvement remains unknown. One hypothesis is that SNS may modulate cortico-anal pathways and drive compensatory changes within the spinal cord or cerebral cortex that beneficially alter sphincter function. Our aim was to assess whether short-term experimental SNS can induce changes in the human cortico-anal pathway. Eight healthy volunteers (mean age 30 years) were studied. Subjects were investigated on three separate occasions and randomized to either active (5 and 15 Hz) or sham rapid-rate lumbosacral magnetic stimulation (rLSMS). Anal sphincter electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from an anal probe following single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, at baseline, immediately, 30 and 60 min following rLSMS at either (i) 5 Hz for 15 min, (ii) 15 Hz for 15 min or (iii) sham stimulation for 15 min. In addition, manometry and anal sphincter sensation was measured in a subset of subjects. Interventions were compared to sham using anova. Fifteen hertz rLSMS increased cortico-anal EMG response amplitude in the 1 h postintervention (F(4, 28) = 3.2, P = 0.027), without a shift in response latency. This effect was not demonstrated with either 5 Hz or sham stimulation. rLSMS had no short-term effect on sensation or physiology. Short-term magnetic stimulation of the sacral nerve roots induces changes in cortico-anal excitability which is frequency specific. These data support the hypothesis that SNS produces some of its beneficial effect in patients with FI by altering the excitability of the cortico-anal pathway.", "pages": "431-41"}, {"volume": "173", "title": "Quantification of the corticospinal silent period evoked via transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9729635", "authors": ["Damron, LA", "Dearth, DJ", "Hoffman, RL", "Clark, BC"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "Prolonged reductions in muscle activity results in alterations in neuromuscular properties; however, the time course of adaptations is not fully understood, and many of the specific adaptations have not been identified.

Immobilization induced deficits in central activation (85 +/- 3 to 67 +/- 7% ) that returned to baseline levels 1 wk after cast removal. The flexor carpii radialis MEP amplitude increased greater than twofold after the first week of immobilization and remained elevated throughout immobilization and 1 wk after cast removal. Additionally, we observed a prolongation of the SP 1 wk after cast removal compared with baseline (78.5 +/- 7.1 to 98.2 +/- 8.7 ms). The contractile properties were also altered, since the rate of evoked force relaxation was slower following immobilization (-14.5 +/- 1.4 to -11.3 +/- 1.0% peak force/ms), and remained depressed 1 wk after cast removal (-10.5 +/- 0.8% peak force/ms).
