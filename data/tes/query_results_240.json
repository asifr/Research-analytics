Ankle joint torque during maximum voluntary plantar flexion was measured by a dynamometer when subjects (n = 10) lay prone on a bench with the right ankle tightly strapped to a foot-plate. Neural control was analysed by comparing soleus motor responses to electrical nerve stimulation (M-wave, V-wave), electrical stimulation of the cervicomedullary junction (CMEP) and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex (MEP). Enhanced torque of 17 \u00b1 8% and 9 \u00b1 8% was found during and 2.5-3 s after lengthening MVCs, respectively. Cortical and spinal responsiveness was similar to that in isometric conditions during the lengthening MVCs, as shown by unchanged MEPs, CMEPs and V-waves, suggesting that the major voluntary motor pathways are not subject to substantial inhibition. Following the lengthening MVCs, enhanced torque was accompanied by larger MEPs (p \u2264 0.05) and a trend to greater V-waves (p \u2264 0.1). In combination with stable CMEPs, increased MEPs suggest an increase in cortical excitability, and enlarged V-waves indicate greater motoneuronal output or increased stretch reflex excitability. The new results illustrate that neuromotor pathways are altered after lengthening MVCs suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of the enhanced torque are not purely mechanical in nature.", "pages": "e49907"}, {"volume": "61 Suppl 2", "title": "Neurostimulation methods in the treatment of chronic pain.", "keywords": ["High definition tDCS", "Human", "Motor cortex", "Plasticity", "Transcranial direct current stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "309001", "authors": ["Rokyta, R", "Fricov\u00e1, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Physiological research / Academia Scientiarum Bohemoslovaca", "abstract": "The main neuromodulatory methods using neurostimulation principles are described.

Special attention is focused on the most common neuromodulatory invasive methods like SCS and MCS and non-invasive methods such as rTMS.

If the BCI decoding is performed by spectral features, stimulation after-effects such as artefacts and evoked activity present a challenge for a successful implementation of BSDS because they can impair the detection of targeted brain states. Therefore, efficient and robust methods are needed to minimize the influence of the stimulation-induced effects on spectral estimation without violating the real-time constraints of the BCI. In this work, we compared four methods for spectral estimation with autoregressive (AR) models in the presence of pulsed cortical stimulation. Using combined EEG-TMS (electroencephalography-transcranial magnetic stimulation) as well as combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and epidural electrical stimulation, three patients performed a motor task using a sensorimotor-rhythm BCI. Three stimulation paradigms were varied between sessions: (1) no stimulation, (2) single stimulation pulses applied independently (open-loop), or (3) coupled to the BCI output (closed-loop) such that stimulation was given only while an intention to move was detected using neural data. We found that removing the stimulation after-effects by linear interpolation can introduce a bias in the estimation of the spectral power of the sensorimotor rhythm, leading to an overestimation of decoding performance in the closed-loop setting. We propose the use of the Burg algorithm for segmented data to deal with stimulation after-effects. This work shows that the combination of BCIs controlled with spectral features and cortical stimulation in a closed-loop fashion is possible when the influence of stimulation after-effects on spectral estimation is minimized.", "pages": "e49907"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Impaired induction of long-term potentiation-like plasticity in patients with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "3203653", "authors": ["Jung, NH", "Janzarik, WG", "Delvendahl, I", "M\u00fcnchau, A", "Biscaldi, M", "Mainberger, F", "B\u00e4umer, T", "Rauh, R", "Mall, V"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Developmental medicine and child neurology", "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity by paired associative stimulation (PAS) in patients with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS).", "pages": "e49907"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Modulation of top-down control of visual attention by cathodal tDCS over right IPS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "46", "pmid": "2077019", "authors": ["Moos, K", "Vossel, S", "Weidner, R", "Sparing, R", "Fink, GR"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "PAS with an interstimulus interval between electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulation of 25 ms (PAS(25)) was performed in patients with HFA/AS (n=9; eight males, one female; mean age 17 y 11 mo, SD 4 y 5 mo) and in typically developing age-matched volunteers (n=9; five males, four females; mean age 22 y 4 mo, SD 5 y 2 mo).

Previous studies suggest that the rIPS is especially involved in top-down control and spatial distribution of attention across both visual hemifields. We further explored these attentional functions using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the rIPS to modulate behavioral performance in a partial report task. Performance was analyzed according to the theory of visual attention (TVA) (Bundesen, 1990), which provides a computational framework to investigate different parameters of visuo-attentional processing such as top-down control, attentional weighting, capacity of visual short term memory, and processing speed. We investigated the effects of different tDCS current strengths (1 mA and 2 mA) in two experiments: 1 mA tDCS (anodal, cathodal, sham) did not affect any of the TVA parameters, but cathodal 2 mA stimulation significantly enhanced top-down control as evidenced by a reduction of the \u03b1 parameter of TVA, regardless of hemifield. This differential impact on the top-down control component of attentional processing suggests that the horizontal rIPS is mainly involved in attentional selection as none of the spatial or resource variables of TVA were altered. Furthermore, the data add evidence to previous work highlighting (1) the importance of using appropriate current strength in stimulation protocols, and (2) that the often reported inhibitory effect of cathodal stimulation in e.g., motor tasks might not extend to cognitive paradigms.", "pages": "e49907"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Test-retest assessment of cortical activation induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with brain atlas-guided optical topography.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "8861684", "authors": ["Tian, F", "Kozel, FA", "Yennu, A", "Croarkin, PE", "McClintock, SM", "Mapes, KS", "Husain, MM", "Liu, H"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces long-lasting NMDA receptor-dependent cortical plasticity via persistent subthreshold polarization of neuronal membranes.
