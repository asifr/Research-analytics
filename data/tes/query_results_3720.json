Evoked electromyographic responses to motor cortex stimulation were recorded from the contralateral orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles. Preliminary investigation into the use of magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex is compared to direct electrical cortical stimulation. This study demonstrates the potential for magnetic stimulation in the intraoperative and outpatient clinical evaluation of facial nerve disorders.

In experiments on cholestase and pancreatitis models in rats we studied hepatospecific enzymes i.e. histidase and urokininanse in blood and liver and membrane-linked enzyme 5'-nucleotidase in the liver tissue. We made three series of experiments: 1 - TTES + valium, 2 - synthetis hexapeptide (SH) - leuenkephaline analog; 3 - TTES + valium + SH. Results obtained from experiments showed that mechanisms of TTES hepatoprotective action are in part conditioned by endogenous opiopeptides mobilization which produced membranestabilizing effect on the hepatocyte. We concluded that in patients with hepatic pathology it was reasonable to combine the electroanesthesia with SH.", "pages": "1012-5"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "[Transcranial brain stimulation.

The involvement of endogenous opioid mechanisms in electroanalgesia was confirmed by enhancing of the analgesia with D-phenylalanine (350 mg/kg). The findings suggest that analgesic effect is based on transcranial electrical stimulation of opioid mechanisms.

By employing surface and depth recordings from various muscles of hand and forearm contralateral to the TCS, it was observed that in the 'early' period of pre-EMG facilitation (100-60 ms before EMG onset) TCS solely recruited the same low-threshold motor units which are fired first during self-paced contractions. In the 'middle and late' epochs of pre-EMG facilitation, TCS served when MEPs were recorded from a relaxed muscle, during TCS of progressively higher intensity. Multiple muscle recordings showed that pre-EMG facilitation was remarkably limited to the muscular group of the hand primarily involved in the intended movement.", "pages": "1012-5"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Enhancement of motor cortical excitability in humans by non-invasive electrical stimulation appears prior to voluntary movement.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "2455627", "authors": ["Starr, A", "Caramia, M", "Zarola, F", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The time course of facilitation of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial electrical stimulation delivered at varying intervals near the onset of a voluntary ballistic movement was studied in 4 normal subjects.

A click, occasionally associated with the scalp stimulation (P = 0.3-0.6), was the signal for the subject to make a brief thumb press on a piston at short latency. The timing of the scalp stimulus and the click was adjusted so that the former occurred approximately between 100 msec before and 100 msec after the onset of the voluntary movement signaled by the EMG in the thenar muscles. MEPs were not detected when the scalp was stimulated 80 msec or more before onset of voluntary movement and then appeared with increasing probability as the time interval before movement shortened. The amplitudes of MEPs in the 80-40 msec period preceding movement onset were small (less than 20% of maximum) and achieved maximum values 20 msec after movement onset.", "pages": "1012-5"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Motor-evoked potentials of tongue musculature in dogs.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6 Pt 1", "pmid": "3374238", "authors": ["Estrem, SA", "Haghighi, S", "Levy, WJ", "Wertheimer, R", "Kendall, M"], "year": "1988", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "abstract": "Transcranial brain stimulation by either electrical or noninvasive magnetic stimulation has produced motor responses of limb musculature.

When the center of the copper coil was positioned 4 cm lateral to the vertex on a line from the vertex to the external auditory meatus, bilateral responses in the masseter, orbicularis oculi, mentalis, and sternocleidomastoideus muscles with a delay of about 10 to 14 ms after the stimulus occurred. Similar to the transcranially evoked muscle responses in hand muscles, the responses in the cranial muscles can be influenced in latency and amplitude by background excitation. It is concluded that these responses are induced by excitation of the face-associated motor cortex followed by multiple I-waves in the corticonuclear tract with both ipsilateral and contralateral projections to the corresponding motoneurones. Additionally, at higher stimulation strengths \"short-latency\" ipsilateral responses in muscles supplied by the trigeminal, facial, and accessory nerves occurred which we suggest are induced by direct stimulation of the peripheral cranial nerves in their intracisternal course. The present study confirms the bilateral projection of corticonuclear tracts in awake unanesthetised human subjects which has been observed by electrical stimulation on the exposed cortex during surgical procedures already decades ago.
