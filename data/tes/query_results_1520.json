The transcranial magnetic stimulations were applied over the right posterior parietal cortex of subjects. Subjects received 4 tests which the TMS onset times were set as 100, 150, 200 and 250 msec after visual stimulus presentation. We found that, when SOA=150 msec, compared to no-TMS condition, There was a significant elevation in response time when the TMS pluses were applied. However for the other SOA cases, there was no significant difference between TMS and no-TMS conditions. Therefore, we considered that \"pop-out\" visual search was processed in the right posterior parietal cortex at about 150 msec after stimulus present.", "pages": "1118-20"}, {"volume": "185", "title": "Short and long duration transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the human hand motor area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17940759", "authors": ["Furubayashi, T", "Terao, Y", "Arai, N", "Okabe, S", "Mochizuki, H", "Hanajima, R", "Hamada, M", "Yugeta, A", "Inomata-Terada, S", "Ugawa, Y"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "The aim of the present paper is to study effects of short and long duration transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the human motor cortex. In eight normal volunteers, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and tDCS was given with electrodes over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the contralateral orbit. We performed two experiments: one for short duration tDCS (100 ms, 1, 3 or 5 mA) and the other for long duration tDCS (10 min, 1 mA). The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the onset of tDCS and TMS were 1-7 and 10-120 ms for the former experiment. In the latter experiment, TMS was given 0-20 min after the end of 10 min tDCS. We evaluated the effect of tDCS on the motor cortex by comparing MEPs conditioned by tDCS with control MEPs. Cathodal short duration tDCS significantly reduced the size of responses to motor cortical stimulation at SOAs of 1-7 ms when the intensity was equal to or greater than 3 mA. Anodal short duration tDCS significantly increased MEPs when the intensity was 3 mA, but the enhancement did not occur when using 5 mA conditioning stimulus. Moreover, both anodal and cathodal short duration tDCS decreased responses to TMS significantly at SOAs of 20-50 ms and enhanced them at an SOA of 90 ms. Long duration cathodal tDCS decreased MEPs at 0 and 5 min after the offset of tDCS and anodal long duration tDCS increased them at 1 and 15 min. We conclude that the effect at SOAs less than 10 ms is mainly caused by acute changes in resting membrane potential induced by tDCS. The effect at SOAs of 20-100 ms is considered to be a nonspecific effect of a startle-like response produced by activation of skin sensation at the scalp. The effect provoked by long duration tDCS may be short-term potentiation or depression like effects.", "pages": "1118-20"}, {"volume": "149", "title": "Kinesthetic illusory feeling induced by a finger movement movie effects on corticomotor excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "17935897", "authors": ["Kaneko, F", "Yasojima, T", "Kizuka, T"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "The present study aimed to clarify whether a kinesthetic illusion arises in our experimental condition (visual stimulus) and whether corticomotor excitability changes in parallel with the kinesthetic illusion. The visual stimulus was a movie in which someone else's limb was being moved. The computer screen showing the movie was installed at an appropriate portion of the subject's forearm, so that the performer's hand appeared as if it were the subject's hand (illusion). The experience of kinesthetic illusion under this condition was verified by interview using a visual analog scale. Healthy male subjects participated in this experiment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to induce motor-evoked potential (MEP) from the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi muscle. Each subject was instructed to watch the same computer display shown as in the illusion, with his own stationary hand in full view (non-illusion) and to watch a display of non-biological movement (moving text) (sham) as the control conditions. The present results showed significant facilitation of MEP under the illusion compared with the control conditions for the index finger abducting in the movie, although not for adducting. MEP in the abductor digiti minimi showed no change during either abduction or adduction of the little finger. The present study demonstrated that an illusion of self-motion can be created by a video of a moving abstract index finger, and inputs to the corticomotor pathways during the self-motion illusion facilitated the corticomotor excitability. The excitatory effect of the illusion depended on the movement direction of the index finger.", "pages": "1118-20"}, {"volume": "120", "title": "Combined monitoring of evoked potentials during microsurgery for lesions adjacent to the brainstem and intracranial aneurysms.", "keywords": [], "issue": "18", "pmid": "17908471", "authors": ["Kang, DZ", "Wu, ZY", "Lan, Q", "Yu, LH", "Lin, ZY", "Wang, CY", "Lin, YX"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "abstract": "Neurophysiologic monitoring during surgery is to prevent permanent neurological injury resulting from surgical manipulation.
