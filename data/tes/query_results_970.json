Transcranial magnetic stimulation can be applied as single pulses of stimulation, pairs of stimuli separated by variable intervals to the same or different brain areas, or as trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies. Single stimuli can depolarize neurons and evoke measurable effects. Series of stimuli (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) can modify the excitability of the cerebral cortex at the stimulated site and also at remote areas along functional anatomical connections. TMS might provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders, but more work is needed to establish the role of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical neurology.", "pages": "105-13"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "EEG oscillations and magnetically evoked motor potentials reflect motor system excitability in overlapping neuronal populations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20093074", "authors": ["M\u00e4ki, H", "Ilmoniemi, RJ"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To understand the relationship between neuronal excitability reflected by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked motor potentials (MEPs) and spontaneous oscillation amplitude and phase.", "pages": "105-13"}, {"volume": "152", "title": "Monitoring of motor and somatosensory systems in a 26-week pregnant woman.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "20084411", "authors": ["Pastor, J", "Pulido, P", "L\u00f3pez, A", "Sola, RG"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "We combined spontaneous EEG measurement with motor cortex TMS and recorded MEP amplitudes from abductor digiti minimi (ADM).", "pages": "105-13"}, {"volume": "166", "title": "Slow-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation can induce bidirectional shifts in motor cortical excitability in awake humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20083166", "authors": ["Groppa, S", "Bergmann, TO", "Siems, C", "M\u00f6lle, M", "Marshall, L", "Siebner, HR"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Midrange-beta oscillations over the stimulated left motor cortex were, on average, weaker before large- than small-amplitude MEPs.

However, oscillations seen in EEG reflect the excitability of a large population of cortical neurons, and MEP amplitude is affected also by spinal excitability and action potential desynchronization. Thus, MEP and EEG oscillation amplitudes are not strongly correlated.
