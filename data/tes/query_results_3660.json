Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been found to selectively induce epileptiform afterdischarges in the epileptic focus of candidates for epilepsy surgery who suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy. Lateralized serial transcranial magnetic stimulation was therefore used and serum levels of prolactin or luteinizing hormone were measured to find if it could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. The investigation was performed on six patients and five healthy volunteers. In the patients the induction of epileptiform potentials was continuously monitored via subdural electrodes. A transient surge of prolactin and luteinizing hormone was found in only one patient, in whom a complex partial seizure was induced. Thus, transcranial magnetic stimulation appeared not to be helpful for the lateralization of the (primary) epileptic focus during presurgical evaluation.", "pages": "242-6"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Spinal sensory and motor tract activation after epidural electrical stimulation in the cat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "2218707", "authors": ["Niznik, G", "Transfeldt, EE", "Shichijo, F", "Ohshima, T", "Pomeranz, B"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) after peripheral nerve stimulation and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after transcranial stimulation have been routinely used as monitors of the viability of pathways in the posterior and anterior spinal cord, respectively, in patients undergoing spinal cord surgery. To assess total spinal cord function, both of these procedures must be performed simultaneously, which is both cumbersome and technically difficult. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate both sensory and motor spinal tract activation after epidural electrical stimulation of the cat spinal cord. Thirty-seven adult mongrel cats were anesthetized with ketamine, intubated, and maintained with Ethrane and nitrous oxide. Stimulating electrodes were placed over the right dorsolateral spinal cord epidurally at T7 after a laminectomy. Recording electrodes were placed over the right L3 spinal cord epidurally, on the right L7 dorsal and ventral nerve roots, on the right and left sciatic nerves in the popliteal fossa, and in the right gastrocnemius muscle. After epidural stimulation of the spinal cord at T11, distinct reproducible potentials were recorded at each site. Activity in the L7 dorsal root implicated activation of spinal sensory tracts. Activity in the L7 ventral root and in the gastrocnemius implicated activation of spinal motoneurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "242-6"}, {"volume": "425", "title": "Corticospinal volleys evoked by anodal and cathodal stimulation of the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "2213580", "authors": ["Burke, D", "Hicks, RG", "Stephen, JP"], "year": "1990", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. In fifteen neurologically normal subjects, corticospinal volleys evoked by transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex were recorded from the spinal cord using epidural electrodes in the high-thoracic and low-thoracic regions during surgery to correct scoliosis. 2. Anodal stimulation at the vertex produced complex corticospinal volleys that could be recorded at both sites, with multiple waves analogous to the D and I waves documented in animal experiments. These volleys were of higher amplitude when the cathode was 7 cm lateral to the vertex rather than 7 cm anterior. There were no differences in conduction time between the two recording sites for D and I waves, when these waves could be identified at the low-thoracic site. 3. Anodal stimuli of 150 V commonly produced a descending volley containing a single peak at both recording sites. Modest increases in stimulus intensity to 225-375 V produced a peak 0.8 ms in advance of the wave of lowest threshold in thirteen subjects and, in seven subjects, further increases produced an additional peak 1.7 ms in advance of the first-recruited wave. The early peaks increased in size with stimulus intensity, replacing the first-recruited wave. These results suggest that the site of impulse initiation with electrical stimulation of the motor cortex shifts from superficial cortex to deep structures, approximately 5 and 10-11 cm below the cortex. These sites are probably the internal capsule and the cerebral peduncle. 4. With cathode at the vertex and anode over the 'hand area' the response of lowest threshold occurred at the latency of the anodal D wave but could not be recorded at the low-thoracic site, suggesting that it was generated by the anode over the 'hand area'. Slightly higher intensities induced a 'cathodal D wave' and still higher intensities produced late peaks at latencies of anodal I waves. These cathodal D and I waves involved axons innervating lumbar segments. There was no evidence that cathodal stimulation preferentially produced I waves. Cathodal stimulation at the vertex with the anode 7 cm anteriorly produced similar results: D waves were produced at relatively low intensities, but I waves appeared at relatively high stimulus intensities if at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "242-6"}, {"volume": "75", "title": "A comparison of magnetic and electrical stimulation of facial nerve at the cerebello-pontine angle in the dog.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "2832547", "authors": ["Estrem, SA", "McCormack, T", "Haghighi, SS", "Potter, T"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Magnetic stimulation is a painless, non-invasive technique which allows an alternative method for testing cranial nerves which were previously inaccessible. We compared the latency of muscle responses obtained by electrical stimulation of the facial nerve at the cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) to high intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 6 dogs. Evoked muscle response from the levator nasolabialis during electrical stimulation had a mean latency of 6.24 +/- 0.42 msec, compared with a mean of latency of 6.13 +/- 0.50 msec obtained by magnetic stimulation. Orbicularis oculi had a mean latency of 3.65 +/- 0.34 msec compared with a mean latency of 3.53 +/- 0.36 msec for magnetic stimulation.

Electrical TCCS was used in 29 subjects and magnetic TCCS in 6 subjects. Response patterns in the different muscles in relation to the strength of the stimulus were analyzed. It was found that the response patterns related to the strength of stimulation differed totally between the TA and the EAS. When the stimulus strength was increased stepwise, a response with a latency of 31.9 +/- 2.5 msec was first recorded in the TA, followed at higher strength by a secondary response with a latency of approximately 100 msec. In contrast, a response with a latency of 105.5 +/- 23.9 msec was first recorded in the EAS. The latency of this response gradually shortened with increasing stimulus strength until a response with a constant latency of 36.1 +/- 6.1 was obtained. In some subjects the response pattern in the BC was similar to that in the TA, and in others it was similar to that in the EAS. Responses in the TA, RA and EAS were all facilitated during voluntary contraction of the EAS. Both responses in the TA and in the EAS were facilitated by voluntary contraction of the TA. During voluntary contraction of the TA an inhibitory period was always recorded, while in the EAS no inhibitory periods were observed during either contraction or relaxation.

After ablation of the pyramidal tract at various levels, N1 through N3 persisted, whereas N4 disappeared. The muscle MEP showed the same latency as that of MEP obtained by direct cortical electrical stimulation and disappeared after similar ablation. These findings suggest that the first three peaks of the spinal MEP are responses of the nonpyramidal cerebellospinal pathways and that the fourth peak of the spinal MEP and the muscle MEP are pyramidal tract responses.

Two possible approaches whereby the human mind could be rendered painless are a schematically-outlined genetic approach, which would or will probably take thousands of years to implement, and a brain stimulation approach that could be effected by means of a noninvasive, contactless, transcranial, deep-neuroanatomic-site-focusable, electromagnetic and/or ultrasonic (and/or, conceivably, other kind of) brain pacemaker which could be developed within a few years.
