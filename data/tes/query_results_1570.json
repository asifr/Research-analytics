The rationale for using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) is in keeping with the goal of maximizing tumor resection and minimizing neurological morbidity. For many years, before the advent of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), only somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored. However, SEPs are not aimed to reflect the functional integrity of motor pathways and, nowadays, the combined used of SEPs and MEPs in ISCT surgery is almost mandatory because of the possibility to selectively injury either the somatosensory or the motor pathways. This paper is aimed to review our perspective in the field of IOM during ISCT surgery and to discuss it in the light of other intraoperative neurophysiologic strategies that have recently appeared in the literature with regards to ISCT surgery. Besides standard cortical SEP monitoring after peripheral stimulation, both muscle (mMEPs) and epidural MEPs (D-wave) are monitored after transcranial electrical stimulation (TES). Given the dorsal approach to the spinal cord, SEPs must be monitored continuously during the incision of the dorsal midline. When the surgeon starts to work on the cleavage plane between tumor and spinal cord, attention must be paid to MEPs. During tumor removal, we alternatively monitor D-wave and mMEPs, sustaining the stimulation during the most critical steps of the procedure. D-waves, obtained through a single pulse TES technique, allow a semi-quantitative assessment of the functional integrity of the cortico-spinal tracts and represent the strongest predictor of motor outcome. Whenever evoked potentials deteriorate, temporarily stop surgery, warm saline irrigation and improved blood perfusion have proved useful for promoting recovery, Most of intraoperative neurophysiological derangements are reversible and therefore IOM is able to prevent more than merely predict neurological injury. In our opinion combining mMEPs and D-wave monitoring, when available, is the gold standard for ISCT surgery because it supports a more aggressive surgery in the attempt to achieve a complete tumor removal. If quantitative (threshold or waveform dependent) mMEPs criteria only are used to stop surgery, this likely impacts unfavorably on the rate of tumor removal.", "pages": "S130-9"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "\"Do what I do\" and \"do how I do\": different components of imitative learning are mediated by different neural structures.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15854245", "authors": ["Petrosini, L"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry", "abstract": "The involvement of different neural structures in imitative learning was studied in two paradigms. In an experimental paradigm, rats observed actor rats learning spatial procedures in a water maze. After the observational training, the observers underwent a cerebellar lesion, preventing further procedural acquisitions, and then were tested in the water maze previously observed. The cerebellar networks appear to be indispensable for acquiring by imitation the spatial procedures. The procedural sequence was then dissected into the single behavioral units, demonstrating that such units do exist and can be independently acquired. By using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), the role of the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in imitative learning was investigated in humans. Subjects observed an actor detecting a hidden sequence in a matrix and then performed the task detecting either the previously observed sequence or a new one. Cerebellar rTMS applied before the observational training interfered with performance of the new sequence, whereas prefrontal rTMS interfered also with performance of the previously observed one. rTMS delivered after the observational training did not influence task execution. These findings indicate that the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex interact in planning actions, the former by permitting the acquisition by imitation of procedural competencies and the latter by providing flexibility among already acquired solutions.", "pages": "S130-9"}, {"volume": "183", "title": "Executive control over response priming and conflict: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "2213580", "authors": ["St\u00fcrmer, B", "Redlich, M", "Irlbacher, K", "Brandt, S"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Responses are usually faster and less error-prone when stimulus (S) and response (R) features correspond than when they do not. Dual-route models of response preparation account for such SRC effects by postulating an indirect route performing S-R selection and a parallel direct route where S features prime their corresponding responses. SRC effects have recently been shown to depend on the preceding trial type, that is, SRC effects are largely reduced when preceded by a non-corresponding trial as compared to a preceding corresponding trial. Present results show that this context dependency of the SRC effect was hindered when rTMS was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 500-300 ms before the onset of the next trial. Moreover, the SRC effect was reduced overall when applying rTMS volleys to the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) for 200 ms with the onset of the visual stimulus. We conclude that the left DLPFC is involved in the context-dependent control of response conflicts, whereas the right PPC serves early visuomotor transformations and is, therefore, related to direct route priming.", "pages": "S130-9"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Effect of low-frequency rTMS on electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and regional brain metabolism (PET) in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "16723892", "authors": ["Horacek, J", "Brunovsky, M", "Novak, T", "Skrdlantova, L", "Klirova, M", "Bubenikova-Valesova, V", "Krajca, V", "Tislerova, B", "Kopecek, M", "Spaniel, F", "Mohr, P", "H\u00f6schl, C"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuropsychobiology", "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations are characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia with high clinical importance.
