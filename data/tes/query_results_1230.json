These include the mood and anxiety disorders, and the schizophrenias. As a natural next step, clinical researchers have investigated whether the minimally invasive brain stimulation technologies (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS] or transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]) might potentially treat these disorders. In this review, we critically review the research studies that have examined TMS or tDCS as putative treatments for depression, mania, obsessive-complusive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or schizophrenia. (Separate controversy articles deal with using TMS or tDCS to treat pain or tinnitus. We will not review here the large number of studies using TMS or tDCS as research probes to understand disease mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.) Although there is an extensive body of randomized controlled trials showing antidepressant effects of daily prefrontal repetitive TMS, the magnitude or durability of this effect remains controversial. US Food and Drug Administration approval of TMS for depression was recently granted. There is much less data in all other diseases, and therapeutic effects in other psychiatric conditions, if any, are still controversial. Several issues and problems extend across all psychiatric TMS studies, including the optimal method for a sham control, appropriate coil location, best device parameters (intensity, frequency, dosage, and dosing schedule) and refining what subjects should be doing during treatment (activating pathologic circuits or not). In general, TMS or tDCS as a treatment for most psychiatric disorders remains exciting but controversial, other than prefrontal TMS for depression.", "pages": "14-21"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Consensus: New methodologies for brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20633398", "authors": ["Huang, YZ", "Sommer, M", "Thickbroom, G", "Hamada, M", "Pascual-Leonne, A", "Paulus, W", "Classen, J", "Peterchev, AV", "Zangen, A", "Ugawa, Y"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "We briefly summarized several new stimulation techniques.

It can be produced in awaked humans by combining the non-invasive electrical stimulation of somatosensory afferents via mixed peripheral nerves with the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. Animal experiments indicate that an application of two converging inputs from various sources in a tightly coupled manner, following the so called Hebbian rule of learning, leads to an increase in motor cortical excitability. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of two plasticity-inducing protocols by quantifying the motor cortex changes using TMS. Plasticity was induced by combining peripheral nerve stimulation with TMS (paired associative stimulation - PAS) and by peripheral motor point stimulation of two adjacent hand muscles (dual associative stimulation - DAS). The protocols were randomly applied in 12 right-handed healthy volunteers. The amplitudes of TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle were recorded before, immediately after PAS or DAS stimulation, and 10, 20 and 30 min later. Both protocols led to significant and lasting changes in MEP amplitudes, however, a significantly larger increase in MEPs was observed after PAS than DAS. The results indicate that afferent input can differently affect cortical motor circuits and produce variable motor output. Thus, the efficacy of LTP-like mechanisms, presumably involved in Hebbian-like plasticity in humans, varies with the types/origin of the converging inputs. Our findings may be relevant when designing therapeutic interventions for improving motor function after neurological injury or disease.", "pages": "14-21"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Increasing human brain excitability by transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "52", "pmid": "19109497", "authors": ["Terney, D", "Chaieb, L", "Moliadze, V", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "For >20 years, noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been used to induce neuroplastic-like effects in the human cortex, leading to the activity-dependent modification of synaptic transmission.

These effects have been observed in 80 subjects through both physiological measures and behavioral tasks. Higher frequencies (100-640 Hz) appear to be responsible for generating this excitability increase, an effect that may be attributed to the repeated opening of Na(+) channels. In terms of efficacy tRNS appears to possess at least the same therapeutic potential as rTMS/tDCS in diseases such as depression, while furthermore avoiding the constraint of current flow direction sensitivity characteristic of tDCS.", "pages": "14-21"}, {"volume": "136", "title": "A magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of brain glutamate in a model of plasticity in human pharyngeal motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19101557", "authors": ["Singh, S", "Mistry, S", "Jefferson, S", "Davies, K", "Rothwell, J", "Williams, S", "Hamdy, S"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "abstract": "Coordinated delivery of peripheral and cortical stimuli (paired associative stimulation [PAS]) has been shown to induce plasticity in limb motor cortex, however, its application in pharyngeal motor cortex and the molecular mechanisms involved in human neuroplasticity remain uncertain.

However, it has not been possible so far to decide whether the observer's motor system resonates primarily with the observed movement direction or the observed muscle activity, as both factors usually co-varied in these action observation studies. Here, we applied TMS to the wrist extensor and flexor during the observation of wrist motions such that the posture of the observer and the model in the video were either congruent or incongruent. Due to this manipulation, it was possible to disentangle whether the observer's primary motor cortex (M1) is facilitated in accordance to either the observed movement direction or the observed muscle activation. Findings revealed that M1 resonated predominantly according to muscle-specific rather than direction-specific parameters of observed movements. More specifically, muscle-specific facilitation was maximal during congruent postures and remained evident, even though to a lower extent, during incongruent postures in which muscle activation and movement direction parameters were discordant. Our findings support the hypothesis that M1 contributes to action observation, by representing the observed movement in intrinsic, muscle-related coordinates. This transformation from extrinsic to intrinsic coordinates might be an important prerequisite for action understanding and imitation. Additionally, our data offer a neurophysiological explanation for interference that emerges when an action is performed while an incongruent action is observed.", "pages": "14-21"}]
