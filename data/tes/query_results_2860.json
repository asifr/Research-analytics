Although almost all of these methods have detected 'abnormalities' of the motor cortex, no method has yet proven to be capable of monitoring disease progression. We and others have used peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) to evaluate corticomotoneuronal dysfunction. The primary peak (PP) in the PSTH reflects the initial rising phase of the excitatory post-synaptic potential evoked at the anterior horn cell by converging corticomotoneurons. In ALS, the PP is delayed in onset, increased in duration, and desynchronized. These abnormalities become more pronounced over time. Delayed PPs also occur more frequently in non-hereditary ALS (nHALS) with disease progression and are a hallmark of the autosomal recessively inherited D90A Cu-Zn SOD mutation. Evidence indicates that in this particular mutation, as well as in nHALS, the fast-conducting monosynaptic pathway originating from large pyramidal Betz cells is preferentially lost, whereas a slow-conducting pathway seems to be spared. This is most likely due to the enormous metabolic demand of the large pyramidal cells, which may explain the selective vulnerability of the most recent phylogenetic system to develop in the human nervous system.", "pages": "S51-6"}, {"volume": "1 Suppl 2", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): compared sensitivity of different motor response parameters in ALS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "11464941", "authors": ["Pouget, J", "Trefouret, S", "Attarian, S"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders : official publication of the World Federation of Neurology, Research Group on Motor Neuron Diseases", "abstract": "Owing to the low sensitivity of clinical signs in assessing upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement in ALS, there is a need for investigative tools capable of detecting abnormal function of the pyramidal tract. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may contribute to the diagnosis by reflecting a UMN dysfunction that is not clinically detectable. Several parameters for the motor responses to TMS can be evaluated with different levels of significance in healthy subjects compared with ALS patients. The central motor conduction time, however, is not sensitive in detecting subclinical UMN defects in individual ALS patients. The amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP), expressed as the percentage of the maximum wave, also has a low sensitivity. In some cases, the corticomotor threshold is decreased early in the disease course as a result of corticomotor neuron hyperexcitability induced by glutamate. Later, the threshold increases, indicating a loss of UMN. In our experience, a decreased silent period duration appears to be the most sensitive parameter when using motor TMS in ALS. TMS is also a sensitive technique for investigating the corticobulbar tract, which is difficult to study by other methods. TMS is a widely available, painless and safe technique with a good sensitivity that can visualize both corticospinal and corticobulbar tract abnormalities. The sensitivity can be improved further by taking into account the several MEP parameters, including latency and cortical silent period decreased duration.", "pages": "S51-6"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human prefrontal cortex induces dopamine release in the caudate nucleus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "15", "pmid": "11459878", "authors": ["Strafella, AP", "Paus, T", "Barrett, J", "Dagher, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Dopamine is implicated in movement, learning, and motivation, and in illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Little is known about the control of dopamine release in humans, but research in experimental animals suggests that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in regulating the release of dopamine in subcortical structures. Here we used [(11)C]raclopride and positron emission tomography to measure changes in extracellular dopamine concentration in vivo after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in healthy human subjects. Repetitive TMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex caused a reduction in [(11)C]raclopride binding in the left dorsal caudate nucleus compared with rTMS of the left occipital cortex. There were no changes in binding in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, or right caudate. This shows that rTMS of the prefrontal cortex induces the release of endogenous dopamine in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus. This finding has implications for the therapeutic and research use of rTMS in neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "pages": "S51-6"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "The prolonged cortical silent period in patients with Huntington's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "11459687", "authors": ["Modugno, N", "Curr\u00e0, A", "Giovannelli, M", "Priori, A", "Squitieri, F", "Ruggieri, S", "Manfredi, M", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In a group of patients with Huntington's disease and age-matched controls, we studied the cortical silent period (SP) elicited by single transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses.", "pages": "S51-6"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Changes in corticomotor representations induced by prolonged peripheral nerve stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "11459686", "authors": ["Ridding, MC", "McKay, DR", "Thompson, PD", "Miles, TS"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We measured the area of the pre-stimulus electromyographic (EMG) activity, the area of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the SP induced by stimuli delivered at an intensity of 150% of motor threshold with a round coil placed over the vertex.
