Studies applying various neurophysiological tests, including spinal and brainstem reflexes, transcranial magnetic stimulation, somatosensory evoked potentials and magnetoencephalography, have documented numerous pathophysiological abnormalities in the various forms of primary dystonia. Owing to differences in the methodology used and in the clinical features of the patients enrolled, these studies have often provided controversial results and failed to determine whether neurophysiological findings correlate with patients' clinical features. In this paper, seeking up-to-date information for use in planning future studies we review the role of neurophysiological methods in the clinical diagnosis of primary dystonia. To improve the current neurophysiological approach to the clinical diagnosis of primary dystonia, future studies should aim to use standardized study designs and methods, enrol homogeneous and clinically well-defined populations and investigate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the available neurophysiological tests.", "pages": "1424-32"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "[Epileptic seizures in critically ill patients].", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "19605972", "authors": ["Stasiukyniene, V", "Pilvinis, V", "Reingardiene, D", "Janauskaite, L"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)", "abstract": "THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE: To review the causes, clinical signs, pathophysiology, consequences, and treatment of seizures and status epilepticus in critically ill patients. Only 25% of people, who have seizures and status epilepticus, have epilepsy as well. In the intensive care settings, seizures and status epilepticus are a common neurologic complication, which is attributable to primary neurologic pathology (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, central nervous system infection, head trauma) or secondary to critical illness (anoxic brain damage, intoxications, metabolic abnormalities) and clinical management. There are three main subtypes of status epilepticus in intensive care units: generalized convulsive status epilepticus, focal motor status epilepticus, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A seizure is a consequence of electrical neurological derangement because of sudden imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory forces within the network of cortical neurons. The main inhibiting neurotransmitter in the brain is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which binds to GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. The main excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Different ions (Cl(-), K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+)) also play a role in the pathophysiology of seizures. Prolonged status epilepticus may lead to different systemic and neurologic consequences. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is one of the most common emergencies encountered in clinical practice, which requires immediate treatment. The first-line drugs are benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam), the second-line ones - phenytoin and fosphenytoin. For the treatment of refractory status epilepticus, barbiturates (phenobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental), valproate, midazolam, propofol, and isoflurane are used. The dosage of drugs and parameters to monitor are referred in the article. The mortality from generalized convulsive status epilepticus is 15-50%; the main factors, influencing prognosis, are the cause and the duration of status epilepticus and age of a patient.", "pages": "1424-32"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Modulation of cerebellar excitability by polarity-specific noninvasive direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "28", "pmid": "19605648", "authors": ["Galea, JM", "Jayaram, G", "Ajagbe, L", "Celnik, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "The cerebellum is a crucial structure involved in movement control and cognitive processing. Noninvasive stimulation of the cerebellum results in neurophysiological and behavioral changes, an effect that has been attributed to modulation of cerebello-brain connectivity. At rest, the cerebellum exerts an overall inhibitory tone over the primary motor cortex (M1), cerebello-brain inhibition (CBI), likely through dentate-thalamo-cortical connections. The level of excitability of this pathway before and after stimulation of the cerebellum, however, has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine changes in M1, brainstem, and CBI before and after 25 min of anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right cerebellar cortex. We hypothesized that anodal tDCS would result in an enhancement of CBI and cathodal would decrease it, relative to sham stimulation. We found that cathodal tDCS resulted in a clear decrease of CBI, whereas anodal tDCS increased it, in the absence of changes after sham stimulation. These effects were specific to the cerebello-cortical connections with no changes in other M1 or brainstem excitability measures. The cathodal effect on CBI was found to be dependent on stimulation intensity and lasted up to 30 min after the cessation of tDCS. These results suggest that tDCS can modulate in a focal and polarity-specific manner cerebellar excitability, likely through changes in Purkinje cell activity. Therefore, direct current stimulation of the cerebellum may have significant potential implications for patients with cerebellar dysfunction as well as to motor control studies.", "pages": "1424-32"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Heritability of intracortical inhibition and facilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "28", "pmid": "15753425", "authors": ["Pellicciari, MC", "Veniero, D", "Marzano, C", "Moroni, F", "Pirulli, C", "Curcio, G", "Ferrara, M", "Miniussi, C", "Rossini, PM", "De Gennaro, L"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "The present twin study investigates heritability of motor cortex excitability, measured by the paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation technique.

Robust ICF and ICI effects were found, with a higher similarity of MZ than DZ and UP pairs. Heritability estimates (h(2)) were 0.80 for ICI and 0.92 for ICF. However, corticospinal excitability did not show significant differences between MZ and DZ pairs, whereas both significantly differed from UP.
