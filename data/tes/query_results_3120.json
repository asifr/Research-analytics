Quantification by in vitro-autoradiography showed no differences for 3H-paroxetine binding (5-HT uptake sites) between rTMS-treated, sham and control animals. In contrast, the number of 5-HT1A binding sites (labeled with 3H-8-OH-DPAT) were selectively increased in the rTMS-group with significantly higher BMAX values in the frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, and the anterior olfactory nucleus. A non-specific increase in NMDA binding sites (labeled with 125I-MK-801) in rTMS and sham animals was observed in the hippocampal formation. A selective increase of these binding sites after rTMS was detected in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the basolateral amygdala and layers 5-6 of the parietal cortex. These findings imply that a single rTMS exposure can result in persistent effects on NMDA and 5-HT1A binding sites even 24 h after stimulation and therefore may be of relevance with respect to the therapeutic action of rTMS reported from clinical studies.", "pages": "15-8"}, {"volume": "263", "title": "Changes of intracortical inhibition during motor imagery in human subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "10213148", "authors": ["Abbruzzese, G", "Assini, A", "Buccolieri, A", "Marchese, R", "Trompetto, C"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning-test paradigm was used to assess changes of corticocortical inhibition and facilitation during mental simulation of sequential finger movements in normal subjects.

The amount of cortico-cortical inhibition was similar to that observed during a mild voluntary contraction of the OP. No change of cortico-cortical facilitation was observed at the ISI of 12 ms.

Rarely do these claims stem from double-blind, peer-reviewed studies, making it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current fads resemble those at the end of the last century, when many were falsely touting the benefits of direct electrical and weak magnetic stimulation. Yet in the midst of this popular interest in magnetic therapy, a new neuroscience field has developed that uses powerful magnetic fields to alter brain activity--transcranial magnetic stimulation. This review examines the basic principles underlying transcranial magnetic stimulation, and describes how it differs from electrical stimulation or other uses of magnets. Initial studies in this field are critically summarized, particularly as they pertain to the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising new research and, perhaps, therapeutic tool, but more work remains before it can be fully integrated in psychiatry's diagnostic and therapeutic armamentarium.", "pages": "15-8"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a neuropsychiatric tool: present status and future potential.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10197825", "authors": ["Post, RM", "Kimbrell, TA", "McCann, UD", "Dunn, RT", "Osuch, EA", "Speer, AM", "Weiss, SR"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention in the treatment of affective disorders. The differences in the type of electrical stimulation required for therapeutic efficacy by rTMS and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are discussed. In contrast to ECT, rTMS would not appear to require the generation of a major motor seizure to achieve therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, it carries the potentially important clinical advantages of not requiring anesthesia and of avoiding side effects such as transient memory loss. Preclinical studies on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampal and amygdala slices, as well as clinical data from neuroimaging studies, have provided encouraging clues for potential frequency-dependent effects of rTMS. Preliminary evidence from position emission tomography (PET) scans suggests that higher frequency (20 Hz) stimulation may increase brain glucose metabolism in a transsynaptic fashion, whereas lower frequency (1 Hz) stimulation may decrease it. Therefore, the ability of rTMS to control the frequency as well as the location of stimulation, in addition to its other advantages, has opened up new possibilities for clinical explorations and treatments of neuropsychiatric conditions.", "pages": "15-8"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Chronic treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation inhibits seizure induction by electroconvulsive shock in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "10189618", "authors": ["Fleischmann, A", "Hirschmann, S", "Dolberg, OT", "Dannon, PN", "Grunhaus, L"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Studies in laboratory animals suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) increase seizure inhibition acutely.
