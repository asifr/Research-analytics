Latencies of nasalis muscle responses to magStim were, therefore, compared with those obtained by direct electrical stimulation of the facial nerve (a) at the root exit zone (REZ); (b) at the porus of the facial canal; and (c) in the stylomastoid fossa during microvascular decompression operations in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Measurements of latencies of the nasalis muscle response, obtained while the stimulating coil was placed over the parieto-occipital area of the scalp, indicated that it was the labryinthine segment of the facial canal, 5 to 16 mm distal to the CPA, that was activated. This would be in agreement with studies of physical models reported in the literature that showed (a) the strength of the electrical current generated by a magnetic field is particularly high close to a nerve foramen; and (b) excitation to magStim is most likely to occur where the induced electrical field changes rapidly over distance, i.e., at anatomical boundaries between media of high and low specific resistance. These characteristics are found at the end of the labyrinthine segment of the facial canal, where the facial nerve leaves the low-resistance cerebrospinal fluid and enters the high-resistance petrous bone. The site of neural excitation is robust and unaffected by stimulus intensity and current direction within a wide range, or by large changes in location of the coil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "829-36"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Computer modelling of brain cortex excitation by magnetic field pulses.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "1433245", "authors": ["De Leo, R", "Cerri, G", "Balducci, D", "Moglie, F", "Scarpino, O", "Guidi, M"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of medical engineering & technology", "abstract": "In spite of many clinical and experimental applications, the technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation still presents obscure aspects.

The development of acute focal cerebral ischemia was shown to be independent of its location, kind and prognosis, accompanied by functional reorganization of whole brain: its supersegmented specialized motor and sensory functional systems, nonspecific formations of segmental peripheral system.

Two hundred and forty-one habenular neurons were tested to noxious and non-noxious stimuli. The habenular neurons exhibited three cell types according to their patterns of response to the noxious stimulus: 123 neurons (51%) responded to noxious stimulus by excitation and were classified as \"nociceptive-on\" cells; 56 neurons (23%) responded to the same noxious stimulus by decreasing their firing rate and were classified as \"nociceptive-off\" cells; and 62 neurons (26%) failed to respond to noxious stimulation and were classified as \"non-nociceptive\" cells. None of these 241 cells responded to non-noxious stimulus. One hundred and fifty-five, 160, 142 and 241 habenular neurons were tested following focal lateral hypothalamus stimulation, dorsal raphe stimulation, cerebellar stimulation and transcranial electrical stimulation alone and concomitant with noxious stimulation, respectively. The observations demonstrate that focal lateral hypothalamic, dorsal raphe and external (transcranial) electrical stimulation suppresses habenular noxious evoked responses while cerebellar electrical stimulation elicits no effect on the nociceptive-off cells and augmenting effects on the nociceptive-on cells. In addition, it was observed that low current (below threshold) external transcranial electrical stimulation was as effective in suppression of habenular noxious evoked responses as was focal brain electrical stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus and dorsal raphe.", "pages": "829-36"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Electrophysiological assessment of spinal cord lesions by means of transcranial cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "1623846", "authors": ["Segura, MJ", "Gandolfo, CN", "Sica, RE"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT) was assessed in 30 healthy volunteers and 22 patients with spinal cord lesions due to compressive, degenerative and demyelinating disease.

Pyramidal Tract (PT) conduction was always abnormal in the clinically impaired corticospinal tracts of all the studied patients. This results correlated with the degree of muscle weakness specially in those having compressive lesions. Subclinical evidence of pyramidal damage was also observed in two patients with Multiple Sclerosis. As opposed to the other groups, patients with degenerative spinal disease, showed essentially symmetric abnormalities. An important overlap of CMCT slowness was seen among the three studied groups, suggesting that this isolated clue is not valuable enough for aetiological suspicion. Double muscle responses due to single TCS were obtained, during rest, in some patients from each group, but never in controls.

Comparison of clinical with evoked potential (EP) findings revealed: 1) a painful stimulus applied to the skin of the arm lowered excitation threshold to cortical stimulation and was a prerequisite to obtain MEPs in 14 instances; 2) only in braindead patients were all EPs abolished simultaneously and bilaterally; 3) MEPs (p less than or equal to 0.05, chi 2-Test), but not necessarily SEPs (p greater than 0.1) were preserved in the arms that showed normal motor reaction during clinical examination; 4) no correlation was found between EP findings and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

In subgroups of patients and their offspring median and tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and electrically elicited long-loop reflexes (LLRs) in hand muscles were also investigated. Increased MEP thresholds were observed in 10% of the HD offspring, while CML, latency variability and MEP amplitudes always lay within normal range. In contrast, SEPs were abnormal in 33%. In HD patients MEPs were found to be abnormal in up to 72% of patients when all available response parameters were taken into consideration. MEP abnormalities correlated with the duration of motor symptoms and the severity of choreic motor activity. When both MEPs and SEPs were evaluated, abnormalities could be detected in 91% of all HD patients. We suggest that abnormal MEPs might reflect an altered excitability of the cortico-spinal system as a consequence of basal ganglia dysfunction, rather than a structural damage of the investigated descending pathways. To localize the pathological mechanism responsible for altered LLRs, a \"loop analysis\" was performed by recording LLRs, MEPs and SEPs in the same patients. Alterations of LLRs correlated best with abnormal SEPs and might therefore be explained by reduced somatosensory input to the motor cortex.", "pages": "829-36"}, {"volume": "239", "title": "Neurophysiological evaluation of sensorimotor functions of the leg: comparison of evoked cortical potentials following electrical and mechanical stimulation, long-latency muscle responses, and transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "46957", "authors": ["Ackermann, H", "Thomas, C", "Guschlbauer, B", "Dichgans, J"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Twenty-two patients with localized lesions of the central nervous system (unilateral cerebral ischaemia, cervical myelopathy, spinal tumour, familial spastic paraplegia) underwent neurophysiological evaluation of sensorimotor deficits of the leg.
