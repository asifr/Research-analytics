In the focus of stimulation the current affected the brain tissue directly, different elements of the cerebral cortex showing unegual sensitivity to various TCMP regimens. The glia was the first to respond, then the neuronal bodies, and the last -- the synaptic structures. In the areas distant from the TCMP focus synaptic components altered first. The ultrastructural changes revealed were not of pathological character.", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "69", "title": "Inhibition of gastric acid secretion in man by the transcranial application of lwo intensity pulsed current.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1097298", "authors": ["Kotter, GS", "Henschel, EO", "Hogan, WJ", "Kalbfleisch, JH"], "year": "1975", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of transcranial electrotherapy (TCE) in reducing gastric secretion in man. TCE has been proposed as a therapeutic modality which induces a relaxed psychological state by the application of low intensity diffuse electrical current and has been purported by Soviet investigators to be beneficial in the treatment of peptic ulcers. Secretion rates were monitored in adult male volunteers by a method of intragastric titration utilizing a pH-sensitive telemetry capsule. In one study 5 subjects had their basal secretion rates monitored before, during, and after the application of TCE at graduated current intensities. A threshold of inhibition was observed for currents of 0.9 ma and greater. In a second study, 12 subjects had histamine-stimulated maximum acid output determined for control and during TCE application. Gastric acid secretion was reduced by an average of 30% when 1-ma TCE was applied, with individual reductions ranging from 5.7% to 53.2%. Since the application of relatively high TCE currents may produce discomfort in some subjects, a third study was conducted to determine whether the inhibition might not merely be the result of nonspecific noxious stimuli. For this study the electrical connections to the TCE electrodes were altered so that the same uncomfortable sensation was produced on the forehead, but no current was actually applied transcranially. This \"placebo\" TCE produced no reduction in the maximal acid output of 6 volunteers, but when the currents were applied transcranially, the gastric acid secretion was reduced by an average of 27% below control values.", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "The absence of residual memory consolidation following transcranial current.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "4402294", "authors": ["Magnus, JG", "Lee-Teng, E"], "year": "1971", "journal": "Physiology & behavior", "abstract": "Either a subconvulsive or a high convulsive current was delivered transcranially at various intervals after a learning trial to independent groups of newly hatched chicks. The one-trial learning involves suppression of the chicks' predilection to peck at a small shiny bead. The effect of current on retention was measured one day later. Results indicate a current-sensitive memory consolidation period of about 30 seconds that cannot be appreciably prolonged by a tenfold increase in current intensity and a simultaneous twofold increase in current duration. On the other hand, at comparable trial-to-current intervals within this brief consolidation period, more retention deficit was caused by the higher current. Beyond this critical period, both currents still effected some retention deficit, but it did not seem to vary with the trial-to-current interval from one minute to 24 hours. Overt muscular convulsion was unnecessary for the retrograde amnesia effect. The subconvulsive current may be a more pure agent for consolidation studies because the high, convulsive current may affect test performance in ways other than disrupting the consolidation processes.", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Retrograde amnesia gradients by subconvulsive and high convulsive transcranial currents in chicks.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "5266155", "authors": ["Lee-Teng, E"], "year": "1970", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "abstract": "", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Effects of transcranial electric currents on renal function of dogs.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "14288357", "authors": ["Wood, WB", "Donnell, RL"], "year": "", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Electrocorticograms following threshold transcranial electroshock for retrograde amnesia in chicks.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "5230187", "authors": ["Lee-Teng, E", "Giaquinto, S"], "year": "1969", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "The effect of transcranial application of electric currents on free fatty acid and blood glucose levels.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "5814602", "authors": ["Martin, FG", "Wood, WB", "Elko, EE"], "year": "1967", "journal": "Experientia", "abstract": "", "pages": "737-9"}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "5814978", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "5814977", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "6050028", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}]
