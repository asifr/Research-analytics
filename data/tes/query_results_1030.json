The impact of this cortical modulation on spinal cord network excitability has rarely been studied. In this series of experiments, performed in healthy subjects, we show that anodal tDCS increases disynaptic inhibition directed from extensor carpi radialis (ECR) to flexor carpi radialis (FCR) with no modification of presynaptic inhibition of FCR Ia terminals and FCR H-reflex recruitment curves. We also show that cathodal tDCS does not modify spinal network excitability. Our results suggest that the increase of disynaptic inhibition observed during anodal tDCS relies on an increase of disynaptic interneuron excitability and that tDCS over the motor cortex in human subjects induces effects on spinal network excitability. Our results highlight the fact that the effects of tDCS should be considered in regard to spinal motor circuits and not only to cortical circuits.", "pages": "5653-64"}, {"volume": "587", "title": "The response to paired motor cortical stimuli is abolished at a spinal level during human muscle fatigue.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 23", "pmid": "10922013", "authors": ["McNeil, CJ", "Martin, PG", "Gandevia, SC", "Taylor, JL"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "During maximal exercise, supraspinal fatigue contributes significantly to the decline in muscle performance but little is known about intracortical inhibition during such contractions. Long-interval inhibition is produced by a conditioning motor cortical stimulus delivered via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 50-200 ms prior to a second test stimulus. We aimed to delineate changes in this inhibition during a sustained maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Eight subjects performed a 2 min MVC of elbow flexors. Single test and paired (conditioning-test interval of 100 ms) stimuli were delivered via TMS over the motor cortex every 7-8 s throughout the effort and during intermittent MVCs in the recovery period. To determine the role of spinal mechanisms, the protocol was repeated but the TMS test stimulus was replaced by cervicomedullary stimulation which activates the corticospinal tract. TMS motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs) were recorded from biceps brachii. Unconditioned MEPs increased progressively with fatigue, whereas CMEPs increased initially but returned to the control value in the final 40 s of contraction. In contrast, both conditioned MEPs and CMEPs decreased rapidly with fatigue and were virtually abolished within 30 s. In recovery, unconditioned responses required <30 s but conditioned MEPs and CMEPs required 90 s to return to control levels. Thus, long-interval inhibition increased markedly as fatigue progressed. Contrary to expectations, subcortically evoked CMEPs were inhibited as much as MEPs. This new phenomenon was also observed in the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Tested with a high intensity conditioning stimulus during a fatiguing maximal effort, long-interval inhibition of MEPs was increased primarily by spinal rather than motor cortical mechanisms. The spinal mechanisms exposed here may contribute to the development of central fatigue in human muscles.", "pages": "5653-64"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Motor cortex plasticity predicts recovery in acute stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "19095754", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Profice, P", "Pilato, F", "Capone, F", "Ranieri, F", "Pasqualetti, P", "Colosimo, C", "Pravat\u00e0, E", "Cianfoni, A", "Dileone, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain given as intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like changes in the stimulated hemisphere and long-term depression (LTD)-like changes in the opposite hemisphere. We evaluated whether LTP- and LTD-like changes produced by iTBS in acute stroke correlate with outcome at 6 months. We evaluated the excitability of affected hemisphere (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) by measuring motor threshold and motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude under baseline conditions and after iTBS of AH in 17 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Baseline amplitude of MEPs elicited from AH was significantly smaller than that of MEPs elicited from UH, and baseline motor threshold was higher for the AH. Higher baseline MEP values in UH correlated with poor prognosis. iTBS produced a significant increase in MEP amplitude for AH that was significantly correlated with recovery. A nonsignificant decrease in MEP amplitude was observed for the UH. When the decrease in the amplitude of UH MEPs was added to the regression model, the correlation was even higher. Functional recovery is directly correlated with LTP-like changes in AH and LTD-like changes in UH and inversely correlated with the baseline excitability of UH.", "pages": "5653-64"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Boosting cortical activity at Beta-band frequencies slows movement in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "19", "pmid": "11180425", "authors": ["Pogosyan, A", "Gaynor, LD", "Eusebio, A", "Brown, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Neurons have a striking tendency to engage in oscillatory activities. One important type of oscillatory activity prevalent in the motor system occurs in the beta frequency band, at about 20 Hz. It is manifest during the maintenance of tonic contractions and is suppressed prior to and during voluntary movement. This and other correlative evidence suggests that beta activity might promote tonic contraction, while impairing motor processing related to new movements. Hence, bursts of beta activity in the cortex are associated with a strengthening of the motor effects of sensory feedback during tonic contraction and with reductions in the velocity of voluntary movements. Moreover, beta activity is increased when movement has to be resisted or voluntarily suppressed. Here we use imperceptible transcranial alternating-current stimulation to entrain cortical activity at 20 Hz in healthy subjects and show that this slows voluntary movement. The present findings are the first direct evidence of causality between any physiological oscillatory brain activity and concurrent motor behavior in the healthy human and help explain how the exaggerated beta activity found in Parkinson's disease can lead to motor slowing in this illness.", "pages": "5653-64"}, {"volume": "147", "title": "Peri-ictal changes of cortical excitability in children suffering from migraine without aura.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "11726806", "authors": ["Siniatchkin, M", "Reich, AL", "Shepherd, AJ", "van Baalen, A", "Siebner, HR", "Stephani, U"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "In adult patients with migraine, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to examine cortical excitability between attacks, but there have been discrepant results. No TMS study has examined cortical excitability in children or adolescents with migraine. Here, we employed TMS to study regional excitability of the occipital (phosphene threshold [PT] and suppression of visual perception) and motor (resting motor threshold and cortical silent period) cortex in ten children suffering from migraine without aura and ten healthy age-matched controls. Patients were studied 1-2 days before and after a migraine attack as well as during the inter-migraine interval. The motion aftereffect was also investigated at each time-point as an index of cortical reactivity to moving visual stimuli. Migraineurs had lower PTs compared to healthy participants at each time-point, indicating increased occipital excitability. This increase in occipital excitability was attenuated 1-2 days before a migraine attack as indicated by a relative increase in PTs. The increase in PTs before the next attack was associated with a stronger TMS-induced suppression of visual perception and a prolongation of the motion aftereffect. Motor cortex excitability was not altered in patients and did not change during the migraine cycle. These findings show that pediatric migraine without aura is associated with a systematic shift in occipital excitability preceding the migraine attack. Similar systematic fluctuations in cortical excitability might be present in adult migraineurs and may reflect either a protective mechanism or an abnormal decrease in cortical excitability that predisposes an individual to a migraine attack.", "pages": "5653-64"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Impact of anesthesia on transcranial electric motor evoked potential monitoring during spine surgery: a review of the literature.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "12686268", "authors": ["Wang, AC", "Than, KD", "Etame, AB", "La Marca, F", "Park, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "abstract": "Transcranial motor evoked potential (TcMEP) monitoring is frequently used in complex spinal surgeries to prevent neurological injury.
