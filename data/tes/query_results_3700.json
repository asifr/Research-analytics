This study investigates the effect of varying stimulus frequency, pulse width, charge balance and polarity, as well as the influence of electrode placement and time of day at which stimulus occurred. A biphasic, charge balanced waveform with a first phase duration of 2 msec, current 10 microA and repetition rate 10 Hz was found to induce maximum tail flick latency changes. The effects of morning or nighttime stimulation were statistically indistinguishable, as were the differences between monophasic and biphasic stimulation. Analgesia was maximized when a positive first phase was delivered into the right ears of the rats, but monolateral stimulation with both electrodes on either the left or the right ear produced no measurable effect. Examination of TE responses in sham and stimulated populations reveals normal response distributions with the stimulated group skewed toward a positive effect.", "pages": "673-81"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Noninvasive motor evoked potential monitoring during neurosurgical operations on the spinal cord.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "2716979", "authors": ["Zentner, J"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "We present the results of monitoring descending pathways with motor evoked potentials (MEP) in 50 patients during neurosurgical operations on the spinal cord. The electromyographic responses of the anterior tibial muscles were recorded. In addition, in 24 patients responses of the thenar muscles after transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex were recorded. Usually, the averages of 5 to 15 signals were evaluated. Although potentials were obtained preoperatively in all 50 patients, during neuroleptanesthesia intraoperative recording from the anterior tibial muscles was possible in 43 patients (86%) and from the thenar muscles in 21 patients (87.5%). Amplitudes were superior to latencies as evaluation criteria for intraoperative changes in potentials. On the basis of acceptable changes in amplitudes of up to 50% at the end of the operation, 16 recordings from the thenar muscles (76.2%) and 35 from the anterior tibial muscles (81.4%) correlated correctly with the postoperative neurological status; there were false positive results in 5 (23.8%) and 8 (18.6%) patients, respectively. We did not observe false negative findings. Postoperative neurological complications coincided in every case with permanent reduction in amplitudes of more than 50% of the base lines or with intraoperative loss of potentials as observed in 3 and 1 patient, respectively. MEP monitoring during neurosurgical operations on the spinal cord is a sensitive method for early detection of impending neurological complications. Major problems are the influence of anesthesia and the definition of acceptable limits for changes in amplitudes.", "pages": "673-81"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Modified impulse diminishes discomfort of transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2707146", "authors": ["Zentner, J", "Neum\u00fcller, H"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex has been developed in 1980 for electrophysiological assessment of the descending pathways. However, the widespread use of this procedure is limited by its painfulness due to simultaneous excitation of the sensory receptors and muscles of the scalp, especially if higher stimulus strengths are necessary in patients with motor deficits to evoke electromyographic responses. The present invention concerns a device which allows modification of the impulse delivered by a commercially available motor stimulator. By interruption on the exponentially decreasing impulse, \"cutting\" it after a freely selectable time by a low resistant short circuit on the patient's side, discomfort due to excitation of the sensory receptors and muscles of the scalp can be diminished with identical electromyographic responses regarded amplitudes and latencies of the potentials, thus making electrical stimulation less painful. Considering the applied charges we found a marked reduction of charge per phase using the modified impulse as compared to the original one with the difference increasing linearily depended on the preselected voltage.", "pages": "673-81"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "[Transcranial and spinal stimulation of motor pathways using conventional stimulator].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2545360", "authors": ["Kadanka, Z", "Pukl, Z"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 neurologie a neurochirurgie", "abstract": "In a group of 31 subjects with a normal locomotor system in the area of the upper extremities transcutaneous cortical and spinal stimulation was administered using a conventional stimulator with an electromyographic tracing on the contralateral tenar and a common investigation of the motor conduction of the median nerve.

MEP were recorded from the contralateral thenar and anterior tibial muscles in response to single transcranial electrical stimuli on the motor cortex. Intraoperatively, during neuroleptic anesthesia we found the amplitudes to be reduced to an average of 11% of the preoperative baselines for the thenar potentials, and to 7% of the preoperative baselines for the anterior tibial muscle potentials, despite a maximum stimulus strength of 750 V. A similar reduction of MEP amplitudes was observed in 6 volunteers during breathing of an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture (34%/66%), whereas fentanyl, flunitrazepam, and thiopental had only a minor effect on MEP.

Beneath the cathode a blood extravasation was constantly observed in the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp; the different electrode arrays produced either a large hemorrhagic lesion or a few petechiae.

Irrespective of the electrode arrays, the scalp and the dura mater displayed hemorrhagic petechiae over a limited area about 2-3 mm in extent. Moreover, the leptomeningeal membrane was microscopically disrupted over an area less than 1 mm large; therein the squamous, overlapping cells were transformed into fusiform or macrophage-like cells.

Stimulation on the scalp excites corticospinal neurones in the motor cortex while stimulation over the spine excites spinal nerve roots. The difference between EMG response latencies after both stimulations represents conduction in the central motor pathways and is called central motor latency (CML). The aim of out experiments was to investigate certain methodological aspects of the technique in order to standardize the procedure. Recordings were done from slightly contracted abductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior muscles after electrical stimulation on the scalp and from the relaxed and contracted abductor digiti minimi and biceps brachii muscles after magnetic brain stimulation. Stimulation over the spine (C7/T1 interspace in case of upper limb muscles stimulation and T12/L1 interspace in case of tibialis anterior stimulation) was always electrical. Using a rather weak non-commercial magnetic stimulator we were not able to activate lower limb muscles, neither we succeeded to evoke responses from the relaxed arm muscles in all subjects. Electrical scalp stimulation proved successful in all cases. Muscle response after cortical stimulation in contracting muscles and shorter latencies and provided more accurate estimate of conduction time in the central motor pathways than responses in the relaxed muscles. Latencies should be measured from several superimposed responses and not from averaged ones. The intensity of stimulation over the neck did not affect CML. We nevertheless suggest that the strongest stimulus intensities should not be used in order to avoid CML overestimation.", "pages": "673-81"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Low current electrostimulation produces naloxone-reversible analgesia in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2626603", "authors": ["Skolnick, MH", "Wilson, OB", "Hamilton, RF", "Collard, CD", "Hudson-Howard, L", "Hymel, C", "Malin, DH"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "A new form of transcranial electrostimulation (TE) has been shown to induce analgesia in rats, as measured by the wet tail flick test.

The resultant analgesia was studied as a function of systematic variations in stimulus frequency, amplitude and duration. The optimal current for inducing analgesia was found to be 10 microA, well below the startle threshold, and several orders of magnitude below effective stimulus current levels required for other treatment modalities. The optimal stimulation duration was 30 min, during which time a slow onset of analgesia was noted. Significant analgesia persisted for at least 200 min after stimulation ended, and no evidence was found of tolerance developing in the course of 5 daily stimulation sessions. Consistent with findings for other forms of electrostimulation, the analgesic effect of TE was abolished by subcutaneous injection of 3 mg/kg naloxone, suggesting that the mechanism of TE analgesia has an endogenous opioid component.", "pages": "673-81"}]
