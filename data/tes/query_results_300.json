Because different electrode montages result in distinct brain current flow patterns across the brain, tDCS dose parameters can be adjusted, in an application-specific manner, to target or avoid specific brain regions. Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability \"under\" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications.\u00a0 In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy.", "pages": "176-83"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Investigating neuroplastic changes in the human brain induced by transcranial direct (tDCS) and alternating current (tACS) stimulation methods.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22956645", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common chronic neurologic disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world population. More than one-third of all epilepsy patients have incompletely controlled seizures or debilitating medication side effects in spite of optimal medical management. Medically refractory epilepsy is associated with excess injury and mortality, psychosocial dysfunction, and significant cognitive impairment. Effective treatment options for these patients can be limited. The cellular mechanisms underlying seizure activity are incompletely understood, though we here describe multiple lines of evidence supporting the likely contribution of astroglia to epilepsy, with focus on individual astrocytes and their network functions. Of the emerging therapeutic modalities for epilepsy, one of the most intriguing is the field of neuromodulation. Neuromodulatory treatment, which consists of administering electrical pulses to neural tissue to modulate its activity leading to a beneficial effect, may be an option for these patients. Current modalities consist of vagal nerve stimulation, open and closed-loop stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Due to their unique properties, we here present astrocytes as likely important targets for the developing field of neuromodulation in the treatment of epilepsy.", "pages": "176-83"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Astroglial networks and implications for therapeutic neuromodulation of epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22952462", "authors": ["Witcher, MR", "Ellis, TL"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in computational neuroscience", "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a broad overview of models and technologies pertaining to transcranial current brain stimulation (tCS), a family of related noninvasive techniques including direct current (tDCS), alternating current (tACS), and random noise current stimulation (tRNS).

However, its neurobiological effects are still largely unknown. Electric fields are known to influence the migration of various cell types in vitro, but effects in vivo remain to be shown. Hypothesizing that tDCS might elicit the recruitment of cells to the cortex, we here studied the effects of tDCS in the rat brain in vivo. Adult Wistar rats (n\u200a=\u200a16) were randomized to either anodal or cathodal stimulation for either 5 or 10 consecutive days (500 \u00b5A, 15 min). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given systemically to label dividing cells throughout the experiment. Immunohistochemical analyses ex vivo included stainings for activated microglia and endogenous neural stem cells (NSC). Multi-session tDCS with the chosen parameters did not cause a cortical lesion. An innate immune response with early upregulation of Iba1-positive activated microglia occurred after both cathodal and anodal tDCS. The involvement of adaptive immunity as assessed by ICAM1-immunoreactivity was less pronounced. Most interestingly, only cathodal tDCS increased the number of endogenous NSC in the stimulated cortex. After 10 days of cathodal stimulation, proliferating NSC increased by \u223c60%, with a significant effect of both polarity and number of tDCS sessions on the recruitment of NSC. We demonstrate a pro-inflammatory effect of both cathodal and anodal tDCS, and a polarity-specific migratory effect on endogenous NSC in vivo. Our data suggest that tDCS in human stroke patients might also elicit NSC activation and modulate neuroinflammation.", "pages": "176-83"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Multi-session transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) elicits inflammatory and regenerative processes in the rat brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "7791365", "authors": ["Rueger, MA", "Keuters, MH", "Walberer, M", "Braun, R", "Klein, R", "Sparing, R", "Fink, GR", "Graf, R", "Schroeter, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Subjective tinnitus is considered a phantom auditory phenomenon.

Many rehabilitation programs are designed to promote such \"neuroplasticity\" to improve voluntary movement following CNS damage. While much is known about this type of activity-dependent plasticity for the muscles that dorsi-flex the ankle, similar information is not available for the plantar-flexors. Presently, we assessed the excitability of corticospinal (CS) and spinal circuits for both soleus (SOL) muscles before and after voluntary contractions of the right plantar-flexors (VOL; 5 s on-5 s off, 40 min), NMES of the right tibial nerve (tnNMES; 5 s on-5 s off, 40 min), or both together (V + tnNMES). CS excitability for the right (rSOL) and left SOL (lSOL) muscles was assessed by quantifying motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Spinal excitability was assessed using measures from the ascending limb of the M-wave versus H-reflex recruitment curve. CS excitability did not change for rSOL (the activated muscle) or lSOL following any condition. In contrast, there was a marked increase in spinal excitability for rSOL, but only following V + tnNMES; the slope of the M-wave versus H-reflex recruitment curve increased approximately twofold (pre = 7.9; post = 16.2) and H-reflexes collected when the M-wave was ~5 % of the maximal M-wave (M(max)) increased by ~1.5\u00d7 (pre = 19 % M(max), post = 29 % M(max)). Spinal excitability for lSOL did not change following any condition. Thus, only voluntary contractions that were coupled with NMES increased CNS excitability, and this occurred only in the ipsilateral spinal circuitry. These results are in marked contrast to previous studies showing NMES-induced changes in CS excitability for every other muscle studied and suggest that the mechanisms that regulate activity-dependent neuroplasticity are different for SOL than other muscles. Further, while rehabilitation strategies involving voluntary training and/or NMES of the plantar-flexors may be beneficial for producing movement and reducing atrophy, a single session of low-intensity NMES and voluntary training may not be effective for strengthening CS pathways to the SOL muscle.", "pages": "176-83"}]
