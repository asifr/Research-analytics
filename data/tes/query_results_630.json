Here, we studied safety, reliability and prognostic value of transcranial sonography (TCS) for DBS lead localization applying predefined TCS criteria. After measuring thermal effects of TCS and imaging artefact sizes of DBS lead using a skull phantom, we prospectively enrolled 34 patients with DBS of globus pallidus internus, ventro-intermediate thalamic or subthalamic nucleus. TCS had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of DBS device or clinical state of patients. TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected. Only patients with optimal lead position on TCS had favorable clinical 12-month outcome (>50% improvement), whereas unfavorable outcome (<25% improvement) was associated with suboptimal lead position. TCS may therefore become a first-choice modality to monitor lead location.", "pages": "1382-91"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Asymmetry of parietal interhemispheric connections in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "24", "pmid": "21677180", "authors": ["Koch, G", "Cercignani, M", "Bonn\u00ec, S", "Giacobbe, V", "Bucchi, G", "Versace, V", "Caltagirone, C", "Bozzali, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Visuospatial abilities are preferentially mediated by the right hemisphere. Although this asymmetry of function is thought to be due to an unbalanced interaction between cerebral hemispheres, the underlying neurophysiological substrate is still largely unknown. Here, using a method of trifocal transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that the right, but not left, human posterior parietal cortex exerts a strong inhibitory activity over the contralateral homologous area by a short-latency connection. We also clarify, using diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging, that such an interaction is mediated by direct transcallosal projections located in the posterior corpus callosum. We argue that this anatomo-functional network may represent a possible neurophysiological basis for the ongoing functional asymmetry between parietal cortices, and that its damage could contribute to the clinical manifestations of neglect.", "pages": "1382-91"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Abnormal cortical synaptic plasticity in primary motor area in progressive supranuclear palsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "21677027", "authors": ["Conte, A", "Belvisi, D", "Bologna, M", "Ottaviani, D", "Fabbrini, G", "Colosimo, C", "Williams, DR", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "No study has yet investigated whether cortical plasticity in primary motor area (M1) is abnormal in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We studied M1 plasticity in 15 PSP patients and 15 age-matched healthy subjects. We used intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to investigate long-term potentiation (LTP) and continuous TBS (cTBS) to investigate long-term depression (LTD)-like cortical plasticity in M1. Ten patients underwent iTBS again 1 year later. We also investigated short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in M1 with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, tested H reflex from upper limb flexor muscles before and after iTBS, and measured motor evoked potential (MEP) input-output (I/O) curves before and after iTBS. iTBS elicited a significantly larger MEP facilitation after iTBS in patients than in healthy subjects. Whereas in healthy subjects, cTBS inhibited MEP, in patients it significantly facilitated MEPs. In patients, SICI was reduced, whereas ICF was normal. H reflex size remained unchanged after iTBS. Patients had steeper MEP I/O slopes than healthy subjects at baseline and became even more steeper after iTBS only in patients. The iTBS-induced abnormal MEP facilitation in PSP persisted at 1-year follow-up. In conclusion, patients with PSP have abnormal M1 LTP/LTD-like plasticity. The enhanced LTP-like cortical synaptic plasticity parallels disease progression.", "pages": "1382-91"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Age-related changes in short-interval intracortical facilitation and dexterity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "21666519", "authors": ["Clark, J", "Loftus, A", "Hammond, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Functional changes in the primary motor cortex might contribute to age-related decline in fine motor control.

To explore the plasticity of the sensory-motor cortex, we employed a modern neurophysiological method, the paired associative stimulation protocol, which resembles the concept of long-term potentiation of experimental studies. Seven patients with genetically verified Unverricht-Lundborg disease and 13 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study to characterize cortical sensory-motor plasticity. In the study protocol, peripheral electric median nerve stimulation preceded navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation targeted to the representation area of thenar musculature on the contralateral primary motor cortex. The protocol consisted of 132 transcranial magnetic stimulation trials at 0.2 Hz, preceded by peripheral sensory stimulation at 25 ms. Motor-evoked potential amplitudes were analyzed at baseline and after the paired associative stimulation protocol at an intensity of 130% of the individual motor threshold. The patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease exhibited an average decrease of 15% in motor-evoked potential amplitudes 30 minutes after paired associative stimulation, whereas in the control subjects, a significant increase (101%) was observed (P < .05), as expected. The results indicate a lack of normal cortical plasticity in Unverricht-Lundborg disease, which stresses the role of abnormal motor cortical functions or sensorimotor integration as possible pathophysiological contributors to the motor symptoms. The impaired cortical plasticity may be associated with the previously reported structural and physiological abnormalities of the primary motor cortex.", "pages": "1382-91"}]
