These investigations included motor evoked potential recordings from the external anal sphincter in response to magnetic stimulation of the cortex and lumbosacral roots, measurement of sacral reflex latency to magnetic and electrical stimulation, and cortical sensory evoked potential recording after stimulation of the dorso-genital nerve and anal canal. Motor latencies after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the anal sphincter were 25.1 +/- 2.9 msec at rest and 20.9 +/- 2.0 msec with voluntary sphincter contraction (facilitation). Motor latency after lumbosacral root stimulation was 3.7 +/- 1.0 msec. Mean sacral reflex latency after magnetic stimulation was 43.8 +/- 11.2 msec and was significantly longer than after electrical stimulation (37.0 +/- 7.2 msec; P < 0.05). P1 latency of the sensory evoked potentials after dorso-genital nerve stimulation was 40 +/- 3 msec and was significantly shorter than after anal stimulation 46 +/- 3 msec (P < 0.01). Evoked potential recording allows us to study both upper and lower motor neuron components to the anal sphincter. The present study paves the way for the combined application of these tests in the evaluation of disorders of the pelvic floor.", "pages": "35-41"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Cerebro-cerebellar interactions in man: neurophysiological studies in patients with focal cerebellar lesions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "7511519", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Molinari, M", "Restuccia, D", "Leggio, MG", "Nardone, R", "Fogli, D", "Tonali, P"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Recently Ugawa and co-workers reported that motor cortex excitability after magnetic stimulation in man can be reduced by coupling an electrical transcranial stimulus over the base of the skull. They hypothesised that the motor cortex inhibition observed was determined by activation of cerebellar structures. Nevertheless, the paradigm employed did not allow to exclude interference from extracerebellar structures due to spread of the electrical stimulus. In order to ascertain the role of the cerebellum in determining the modulation of the motor cortex excitability we examined, in 10 normal subjects and in 2 patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, the effects of electrical stimuli over the base of the skull on the motor responses evoked by cortical magnetic stimulation. In both patients no inhibition of motor responses was present in the muscles ipsilateral to the lesion, whereas an inhibition, similar to that observed in controls, was evident on the opposite side. The present findings suggest the cerebellar origin of the motor effects seen after electrical stimulation of the base of the skull and further clarify the physiological cerebro-cerebellar interactions in man.", "pages": "35-41"}, {"volume": "633", "title": "Excitation of the motor cortex associated with the E2 phase of cutaneous reflexes in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "8137169", "authors": ["Ohki, Y", "Suzuki, T", "Ugawa, Y", "Uesaka, Y", "Sakai, K", "Kanazawa, I"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "We investigated excitability changes of the motor cortex associated with the E2 phase of cutaneous reflexes in the first dorsal interosseous muscle using transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in humans. EMG responses to combined cutaneous and weak magnetic cortical stimulation, which were elicited during the E2 phase of cutaneous reflexes, were larger than those by the same magnetic cortical stimulation alone. This facilitatory effect was reduced or even inhibitory effect was seen when the intensity of cortical stimulation was increased. Responses to weak electrical cortical stimulation were less affected by the combined cutaneous stimulation. The same facilitatory effect on responses to weak magnetic cortical stimulation was also observed in single motor unit recordings, too. Dissociation between facilitatory effects on the responses evoked by weak magnetic and weak electrical cortical stimulations suggests that the motor cortical excitability is increased in association with the E2 phase.

A long, straight, uniform fiber is polarized by an activating function, proportional to the axial gradient of the axial electric field. During unipolar anodal stimulation, the activating function results in two areas of depolarization (virtual cathodes) that are responsible for anode-make stimulation. During unipolar cathodal stimulation, the virtual anodes can be exploited to produce unidirectional propagation and physiological recruitment of axons. Anode-break stimulation of nerves arises from the intrinsic properties of the sodium channel kinetics; cathode-break stimulation in nerves is anode-break stimulation at a virtual anode. The activating function applies to magnetic stimulation as well as to electric stimulation. Other important mechanisms of stimulation arise if the fiber is terminated, nonuniform, or curved. In the brain, cortical neurons are excited when the electric field is directed from the dendrites toward the axon. Possible mechanisms for cortical excitation are the impedance mismatch between the axon and dendritic tree, and the axon bending as it enters the white matter. Transcranial magnetic stimulation differs from transcranial electric stimulation because during magnetic stimulation the electric field is parallel to the brain surface, whereas during electric stimulation the electric field has components both parallel and perpendicular to the brain surface. Cardiac tissue can be represented by use of the bidomain model. This model predicts that a point-source stimulus results in adjacent areas of depolarized and hyperpolarized tissue. The presence of virtual anodes during cathodal stimulation is analogous to the creation of virtual anodes along a one-dimensional fiber by the activating function. Anode- and cathode-break stimulation both occur in cardiac tissue, but the mechanism may be different than for nerve and may depend on diffusion of depolarization into a previously hyperpolarized region. Electrical stimulation of cardiac tissue can cause reentry through a critical point mechanism. Two mechanisms for defibrillation have been hypothesized: (1) the relatively high junctional resistance between cardiac cells causes each cell to be depolarized on one side and hyperpolarized on the other; and (2) the fiber tracts within the heart behave like individual fibers, with fiber curvature providing a mechanism for polarization. Similarities among nerve, brain, and cardiac stimulation are emphasized.", "pages": "35-41"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Pathophysiology of hemimasticatory spasm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8301304", "authors": ["Cruccu, G", "Inghilleri, M", "Berardelli, A", "Pauletti, G", "Casali, C", "Coratti, P", "Frisardi, G", "Thompson, PD", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Two patients aged 21 and 50 years presented with facial hemiatrophy and unilateral spasms of the masticatory muscles. Masticatory muscle biopsy showed normal findings in both patients and facial skin biopsy specimens only showed atrophy, although morphoea (localised facial scleroderma) had been diagnosed nine years previously in the second patient. The involuntary movements consisted of brief twitches and prolonged contractions clinically and electromyographically similar to those of hemifacial spasm and cramps. The jaw jerk and the silent periods were absent in the affected muscles. Direct stimulation of the muscle nerve and transcranial stimulation of the trigeminal root demonstrated slowing of conduction and after-activity due to autoexcitation. Observations in other reported cases and these two patients suggest that hemimasticatory spasm is produced by ectopic activity secondary to focal demyelination of the trigeminal motor nerve fibres. The proposed cause of the neuropathy is focal damage to the masticatory nerves caused by compression, possibly resulting from the deep tissue changes that occur in facial hemiatrophy.", "pages": "35-41"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Transcranial cortical stimulation in syringomyelia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "1795166", "authors": ["McDonald, CM", "Robinson, LR"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "The intracarotid amobarbital procedure and direct cortical stimulation are commonly used techniques for functional mapping in candidates for epilepsy surgery.
