Processes of memory consolidation typically occurring during this state of sleep were also enhanced. Here, we show that the same tSOS applied in the waking brain also induced an increase in endogenous EEG slow oscillations (0.4-1.2 Hz), although in a topographically restricted fashion. Applied during wakefulness tSOS, additionally, resulted in a marked and widespread increase in EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity. During wake, tSOS did not enhance consolidation of memories when applied after learning, but improved encoding of hippocampus-dependent memories when applied during learning. We conclude that the EEG frequency and related memory processes induced by tSOS critically depend on brain state. In response to tSOS during wakefulness the brain transposes stimulation by responding preferentially with theta oscillations and facilitated encoding.", "pages": "15460-5"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Paroxetine pretreatment does not change the effects induced in the rat cortical beta-adrenergic receptor system by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive shock.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "19249269", "authors": ["Vetulani, J", "Roman, A", "Kowalska, M", "Nalepa, I"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a clinically effective antidepressant treatment, but meta-analysis suggests that its efficacy is marginal. We investigated whether the administration of rTMS together with paroxetine would enhance its effects on the beta-adrenergic system of the rat. We compared our results with the effects of electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECS). The experiment was performed for 12 d on male Wistar rats that received a physical treatment of either rTMS (B=1.4 T, f=10 Hz, 300 s) or ECS (I=130 mA, f=50 Hz, t=500 ms), preceded by sterile water or paroxetine (10 mg/kg i.p. 30 min earlier). All rats were decapitated 24 h after the final treatment. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) was measured in cortical slices prelabelled with [3H]adenine and stimulated with noradrenaline. beta-adrenoceptor parameters (Bmax and KD) were assessed in the P2 fraction of cortical homogenates using [3H]CGP 12177 as a ligand. ECS resulted in down-regulation of both the cAMP response and beta-adrenoceptor density, while rTMS depressed only the responsiveness of the cAMP-generating system. Paroxetine, which was only effective in dampening the cAMP response, did not change the effects of either physical treatment. The data suggest that any possible interaction between paroxetine and rTMS or ECS does not involve the beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", "pages": "15460-5"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Correlation between disability and transcranial magnetic stimulation abnormalities in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "19026538", "authors": ["Kale, N", "Agaoglu, J", "Onder, G", "Tanik, O"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system.

The aim of this study is to assess motor evoked potentials (MEP) of MS patients by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and investigate the possible correlations between TMS abnormalities and disability in the patient group, which includes a subgroup with no apparent pyramidal tract dysfunction. A total of 131 clinically definite MS patients were included in the study. Motor responses to TMS stimulation were recorded. Absent values, decreases in amplitude, prolongation of latency and central motor conduction time (CMCT) were considered as abnormal. A total of 109 (83%) patients displayed abnormal MEP amplitude, 68 (52%) displayed MEP latency, and 64 (49%) displayed CMCT abnormalities. Abnormal CMCT, latency and amplitude results were correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (p<0.001).

Each patient received 10, 1-Hz rTMS treatments to suppress a part of R pars triangularis. P1 was a 'good responder' with improved naming and phrase length; P2 was a 'poor responder' without improved naming. Pre-TMS (10 years poststroke), P1 had significant activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex, R IFG, and in both L and R SMA during overt naming fMRI (28% pictures named). At 3 mo. post-TMS (42% named), P1 showed continued activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex, R IFG, and in R and L SMA. At 16 mo. post-TMS (58% named), he also showed significant activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex mouth and R IFG. He now showed a significant increase in activation in the L SMA compared to pre-TMS and at 3 mo. post-TMS (p < .02; p < .05, respectively). At 16 mo. there was also greater activation in L than R SMA (p < .08). At 46 mo. post-TMS (42% named), this new LH pattern of activation continued. He improved on the Boston Naming Test from 11 pictures named pre-TMS, to scores ranging from 14 to 18 pictures, post-TMS (2-43 mo. post-TMS). His longest phrase length (Cookie Theft picture) improved from three words pre-TMS, to 5-6 words post-TMS. Pre-TMS (1.5 years poststroke), P2 had significant activation in R IFG (3% pictures named). At 3 and 6 mo. post-TMS, there was no longer significant activation in R IFG, but significant activation was present in R sensorimotor cortex. On all three fMRI scans, P2 had significant activation in both the L and R SMA. There was no new, lasting perilesional LH activation across sessions for this patient. Over time, there was little or no change in his activation. His naming remained only at 1-2 pictures during all three fMRI scans. His BNT score and longest phrase length remained at one word, post-TMS. Lesion site may play a role in each patient's fMRI activation pattern and response to TMS treatment. P2, the poor responder, had an atypical frontal lesion in the L motor and premotor cortex that extended high, near brain vertex, with deep white matter lesion near L SMA. P2 also had frontal lesion in the posterior middle frontal gyrus, an area important for naming (Duffau et al., 2003); P1 did not. Additionally, P2 had lesion inferior and posterior to Wernicke's area, in parts of BA 21 and 37, whereas P1 did not. The fMRI data of our patient who had good response following TMS support the notion that restoration of the LH language network is linked in part, to better recovery of naming and phrase length in nonfluent aphasia.", "pages": "15460-5"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Noninvasive techniques for probing neurocircuitry and treating illness: vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17086200", "authors": ["George, MS", "Aston-Jones, G"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Although the preceding chapters discuss much of the new knowledge of neurocircuitry of neuropsychiatric diseases, and an invasive approach to treatment, this chapter describes and reviews the noninvasive methods of testing circuit-based theories and treating neuropsychiatric diseases that do not involve implanting electrodes into the brain or on its surface.

Yet, there is still little knowledge on how time-varied exogenous currents acutely modulate cortical excitability. In ten healthy individuals we used on-line single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to search for systematic shifts in corticospinal excitability during anodal sleeplike 0.8-Hz slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS). In separate sessions, we repeatedly applied 30-s trials (two blocks at 20 min) of either anodal so-tDCS or constant tDCS (c-tDCS) to the primary motor hand area during quiet wakefulness. Simultaneously and time-locked to different phase angles of the slow oscillation, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as an index of corticospinal excitability were obtained in the contralateral hand muscles 10, 20, and 30 s after the onset of tDCS. MEPs were also measured off-line before, between, and after both stimulation blocks to detect any lasting excitability shifts. Both tDCS modes increased MEP amplitudes during stimulation with an attenuation of the facilitatory effect toward the end of a 30-s tDCS trial. No phase-locking of corticospinal excitability to the exogenous oscillation was observed during so-tDCS. Off-line TMS revealed that both c-tDCS and so-tDCS resulted in a lasting excitability increase. The individual magnitude of MEP facilitation during the first tDCS trials predicted the lasting MEP facilitation found after tDCS. We conclude that sleep slow oscillation-like excitability changes cannot be actively imposed on the awake cortex with so-tDCS, but phase-independent on-line as well as off-line facilitation can reliably be induced.", "pages": "15460-5"}, {"volume": "132", "title": "Abnormal sensorimotor plasticity in organic but not in psychogenic dystonia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 10", "pmid": "17905642", "authors": ["Quartarone, A", "Rizzo, V", "Terranova, C", "Morgante, F", "Schneider, S", "Ibrahim, N", "Girlanda, P", "Bhatia, KP", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Dystonia is characterized by two main pathophysiological abnormalities: 'reduced' excitability of inhibitory systems at many levels of the sensorimotor system, and 'increased' plasticity of neural connections in sensorimotor circuits at a brainstem and spinal level. A surprising finding in two recent papers has been the fact that abnormalities of inhibition similar to those in organic dystonia are also seen in patients who have psychogenic dystonia. To try to determine the critical feature that might separate organic and psychogenic conditions, we investigated cortical plasticity in a group of 10 patients with psychogenic dystonia and compared the results with those obtained in a matched group of 10 patients with organic dystonia and 10 healthy individuals. We confirmed the presence of abnormal motor cortical inhibition (short-interval intracortical inhibition) in both organic and psychogenic groups. However, we found that plasticity (paired associative stimulation) was abnormally high only in the organic group, while there was no difference between the plasticity measured in psychogenic patients and healthy controls. We conclude that abnormal plasticity is a hallmark of organic dystonia; furthermore it is not a consequence of reduced inhibition since the latter is seen in psychogenic patients who have normal plasticity.", "pages": "15460-5"}, {"volume": "587", "title": "Human motor associative plasticity induced by paired bihemispheric stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 19", "pmid": "18222688", "authors": ["Koganemaru, S", "Mima, T", "Nakatsuka, M", "Ueki, Y", "Fukuyama, H", "Domen, K"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is an effective non-invasive method to induce human motor plasticity by the repetitive pairing of peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at the primary motor cortex (M1) with a specific time interval. Although the repetitive pairing of two types of afferent stimulation might be a biological basis of neural plasticity and memory, other types of paired stimulation of the human brain have rarely been studied. We hypothesized that the repetitive pairing of TMS and interhemispheric cortico-cortical projection or paired bihemispheric stimulation (PBS), in which the right and left M1 were serially stimulated with a time interval of 15 ms, would produce an associative long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effect. In this study, 23 right-handed healthy volunteers were subjected to a 0.1 Hz repetition of 180 pairings of bihemispheric TMS, and physiological and behavioural measures of the motor system were compared before, immediately after, 20 min after and 40 min after PBS intervention. The amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) induced by the left M1 stimulation and its input-output function increased for up to approximately 20 min post-PBS. Fine finger movements were also facilitated by PBS. Spinal excitability measured by the H-reflex was insensitive to PBS, suggesting a cortical mechanism. The associative LTP-like effect induced by PBS was timing dependent, occurring only when the interstimulus interval was 5-25 ms. These findings demonstrate that using PBS in PAS can induce motor cortical plasticity, and this approach might be applicable to the rehabilitation of patients with motor disorders.", "pages": "15460-5"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Afferent-induced facilitation of primary motor cortex excitability in the region controlling hand muscles in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "18819109", "authors": ["Devanne, H", "Degardin, A", "Tyvaert, L", "Bocquillon, P", "Houdayer, E", "Manceaux, A", "Derambure, P", "Cassim, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Sensory inputs from cutaneous and limb receptors are known to influence motor cortex network excitability.

In the present work, we sought to establish how proprioceptive sensory inputs modulate the excitability of the primary motor cortex region controlling certain hand and wrist muscles. Suprathreshold TMS pulses were preceded either by median nerve stimulation (MNS) or index finger stimulation with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging from 20 to 200 ms (with particular focus on 40-80 ms). Motor-evoked potentials recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsalis interosseus and extensor carpi radialis muscles were strongly facilitated (by up to 150%) by MNS with ISIs of around 60 ms, whereas digit stimulation had only a weak effect. When MNS was delivered at the interval that evoked the optimal facilitatory effect, the H-reflex amplitude remained unchanged and APB motor responses evoked with transcranial electric stimulation were not increased as compared with TMS. Afferent-induced facilitation and short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) mechanisms are likely to interact in cortical circuits, as suggested by the strong facilitation observed when MNS was delivered concurrently with ICF and the reduction of SICI following MNS.
