Group 1 was comprised of 11 dogs used for measuring the basic wave form of spinal MEPT. The normal spinal MEPT response curve consists of two major peaks: peak I and peak II. The latency of peak I and peak II at T13-L1 was 6.0 +/- 0.6 and 7.1 +/- 0.6 msec, and the amplitude, 3.3 +/- 1.6 and 6.1 +/- 2.6 microV, respectively. Group 2 was comprised of six animals subjected to spinal ischemia, in which a time-related deterioration of the MEPT as well as evoked spinal cord potential (ESP) was demonstrated. The time taken until the loss of peak I and peak II was 19.2 +/- 5.3 and 21.7 +/- 6.2 min, respectively, while the time taken until the loss of ESP was 36.7 +/- 14.0 min. In group 3, comprised of seven animals, the aorta was unclamped and the animals were allowed to recover when the spinal MEPT had disappeared. Four had paraparesis immediately after the operation, two had a normal gait, one died, and one developed spastic paraplegia after 24 h. We concluded that the change in spinal MEPT during spinal ischemia occurred earlier than the change in ESP, and that the loss of MEPT suggested irreversible spinal cord damage.", "pages": "43-5"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Assessment of corticospinal and somatosensory conduction simultaneously during scoliosis surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "1282457", "authors": ["Burke, D", "Hicks, R", "Stephen, J", "Woodforth, I", "Crawford, M"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The function of descending motor pathways and that of ascending sensory pathways in the spinal cord were monitored at the same time in 120 patients undergoing surgery for scoliosis.

They shared approximately the same latencies as the late responses (S100 and S > 150) that we have previously recorded following TCCS. A period of inhibition that started at 150 msec was also recorded. A period of facilitation could also be noted when the conditioning stimulus was applied either over the deltoid muscle or when the click that accompanied the magnetic pulse was used.

The probable basis of sympatho-inhibition during transcranial electrical stimulation is a reduction of excitatory input to bulbar sympathoexcitatory neurons. It was revealed in experiments with inhibition of sympatho-excitation elicited by temporal brain ischaemia and local electrical stimulation of different bulbar ventrolateral vasomotor zones.

A new technique was recently introduced to record the muscle action potential of facial muscles by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve. The experimental data that was obtained indicate that this technique allows to stimulate the facial nerve above the stylomastoid foramen: a greater tract of the nerve can therefore be explored than what was possible with the traditional electrical stimulation at the mastoid. Until now no comparison data was available on the clinical usefulness of the two methods. We decided to study 14 normal controls and 26 patients suffering from unilateral idiopathic facial palsy (Bell's palsy) and to submit these two groups to magnetic transcranial stimulation and electrical stimulation of the facial nerve in the mastoid region, to the purpose of observing where the nerve is stimulated by the magnetic impulse and which of the two techniques can be of accurate prognostic value in the study of the evolution of the clinical lesion. The electromyographic responses were elicited by the electrical stimulation at the mastoid and by transcranial stimulation after positioning the coil on the parieto-occipital scalp. A recording was taken from the ipsilateral orhicularis oculi muscle utilising two cupped electrodes. The latency and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential were measured bilaterally in order to compare the results obtained on both the affected and the healthy sides. The patients were scheduled to two neurophysiological and clinical evaluations at about 30 days interval one from the other: the first test was not carried out before 20 days from the onset of the deficit; further clinical examination was carried out only 6 months later. The analysis of the results obtained in the normal controls submitted to transcranial magnetic stimulation indicate that the nerve is activated at the point where it originates from the brainstem. The study carried out showed that transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve, does not provide data which can be correlated to the clinical situation observed at the time of the study; furthermore, transcranial magnetic stimulation does not supply any prognostic data on the clinical evolution of the lesion.", "pages": "43-5"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Facilitation of motor evoked potentials by somatosensory afferent stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1385090", "authors": ["Deletis, V", "Schild, JH", "Beri\u0107, A", "Dimitrijevi\u0107, MR"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The effect of an electrically induced peripheral afferent volley upon electrical and magnetic motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from muscles of the upper and lower extremities was studied in 16 healthy volunteers. A standard conditioning-test (C-T) paradigm was employed whereby the test stimulus (transcranial electric or magnetic) was applied at random time intervals, from 10 msec prior to 90 msec after the conditioning stimulus (peripheral nerve stimulus). MEP amplitude facilitation was observed for the majority of the upper extremity muscles tested at two distinct periods, one occurring at short, and the other at long C-T intervals. This bimodal trend of MEP facilitation was found to be equally as prominent in the lower extremity muscles tested. The period of short C-T interval facilitation is consistent with modifications in the spinal excitability of the segmental motoneuron pool. On the other hand, the period of long C-T interval facilitation is suggested to be due to alterations in excitability of the motor cortex as a result of the arrival of the orthodromic sensory volley. Although most pronounced in muscles innervated by the nerve to which the conditioning stimulus was applied, this bimodal facilitatory effect was also observed in adjacent muscles not innervated by the stimulated nerve. Qualitatively, the conditioned MEPs from the upper and lower extremities responded similarly to both electrical and magnetic trans-cranial stimulation. In addition, our study demonstrates that the C-T paradigm has potential for use in the assessment of spinal and cortical sensorimotor integration by providing quantitative information which cannot be obtained through isolated assessment of sensory and/or motor pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "43-5"}, {"volume": "75", "title": "Intraoperative monitoring of tibialis anterior muscle motor evoked responses to transcranial electrical stimulation during partial neuromuscular blockade.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "1356320", "authors": ["Kalkman, CJ", "Drummond, JC", "Kennelly, NA", "Patel, PM", "Partridge, BL"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "We studied the feasibility of recording motor evoked responses to transcranial electrical stimulation (tce-MERs) during partial neuromuscular blockade (NMB).

The level of NMB was assessed by accelerometry of the adductor pollicis muscle after train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The compound muscle action potential was also recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle after direct stimulation of the peroneal nerve (M-response) as an alternative means of assessing the degree of NMB.
