Noninvasive stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be suitable to treat chronic pain as they can act on these networks by modulating neural activities not only in the stimulated area, but also in remote regions that are interconnected to the site of stimulation. Motor cortex was the first cortical target that was proved to be efficacious in chronic pain treatment. At present, significant analgesic effects were also shown to occur after the stimulation of other cortical targets (including prefrontal and parietal areas) in acute provoked pain, chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, or visceral pain. Therapeutic applications of rTMS in pain syndromes are limited by the short duration of the induced effects, but prolonged pain relief can be obtained by repeating rTMS sessions every day for several weeks. Recent tDCS studies also showed some effects on various types of chronic pain. We review the evidence to date of these two techniques of noninvasive brain stimulation for the treatment of pain.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation/transcranial direct current stimulation in cognitive neurorehabilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20633391", "authors": ["Miniussi, C", "Cappa, SF", "Cohen, LG", "Floel, A", "Fregni, F", "Nitsche, MA", "Oliveri, M", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Paulus, W", "Priori, A", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are a common consequence of neurologic disease, in particular, of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders, and there is evidence that specific cognitive training may be effective in cognitive rehabilitation. Several investigations emphasize the fact that interacting with cortical activity, by means of cortical stimulation, can positively affect the short-term cognitive performance and improve the rehabilitation potential of neurologic patients. In this respect, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical stimulation may play a role in treating aphasia, unilateral neglect, and other cognitive disorders. Several possible mechanisms can account for the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive performance. They all reflect the potential of these methods to improve the subject's ability to relearn or to acquire new strategies for carrying out behavioral tasks. The responsible mechanisms remain unclear but they are most likely related to the activation of impeded pathways or inhibition of maladaptive responses. Modifications of the brain activity may assist relearning by facilitating local activity or by suppressing interfering activity from other brain areas. Notwithstanding the promise of these preliminary findings, to date no systematic application of these methods to neurorehabilitation research has been reported. Considering the potential benefit of these interventions, further studies taking into consideration large patient populations, long treatment periods, or the combination of different rehabilitation strategies are needed. Brain stimulation is indeed an exciting opportunity in the field of cognitive neurorehabilitation, which is clearly in need of further research.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Myoinositol content in the human brain is modified by transcranial direct current stimulation in a matter of minutes: a 1H-MRS study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "18816828", "authors": ["Rango, M", "Cogiamanian, F", "Marceglia, S", "Barberis, B", "Arighi, A", "Biondetti, P", "Priori, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine : official journal of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine / Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine", "abstract": "Brain content of myoinositol (mI) has been shown to be altered in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Likewise, various forms of electric currents have been applied to the human brain for therapeutic purposes in neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study we aimed to depict the effects of low-power transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain mI by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). We studied two groups of five healthy subjects by (1)H-MRS: the first group was studied before and after both anodal and sham (placebo) tDCS over the right frontal lobe, and the second group was studied at the same intervals without undergoing either sham or anodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS induced a significant increase of mI content at 30 min after stimulation offset (141.5 +/- 16.7%, P < 0.001) below the stimulating electrode but not in distant regions, such as the visual cortex, whereas sham tDCS failed to induce changes in mI. Neither N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) nor the other metabolite contents changed after anodal or sham stimulation. (1)H-MRS represents a powerful tool to follow the regional effects of tDCS on brain mI and, possibly, on the related phosphoinositide system.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Time-specific contribution of the supplementary motor area to intermanual transfer of procedural knowledge.", "keywords": [], "issue": "39", "pmid": "18815252", "authors": ["Perez, MA", "Tanaka, S", "Wise, SP", "Willingham, DT", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "The supplementary motor area (SMA) makes a crucial contribution to intermanual transfer: the ability to use one hand to perform a skill practiced and learned with the other hand. However, the timing of this contribution relative to movement remains unknown. Here, 33 healthy volunteers performed a 12 item sequence in the serial reaction time task. During training, each participant responded to a sequence of visual cues presented at 1 Hz by pressing one of four keys with their right hand. The measure of intermanual transfer was response time (RT) during repetition of the trained sequence with the left hand, which was at rest during learning. Participants were divided into three groups, which did not differ in their learning rates or amounts. In two groups, 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced transient virtual lesions of the SMA during training, either 100 ms before each cue (the premovement group) or during each key press (the movement group). The third group received sham stimulation (the sham group). After training with the right hand, RTs for performance with the left (transfer) hand were longer for the premovement group than for the movement or sham groups. Thus, the most crucial contribution of SMA to intermanual transfer occurs in the interval between movements, when the memory of a previous movement plays a role in encoding specific sequences. These results provide insight into frontal lobe contributions to procedural knowledge.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "445", "title": "Unimanual muscle activation increases interhemispheric inhibition from the active to the resting hemisphere.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10881554", "authors": ["Vercauteren, K", "Pleysier, T", "Van Belle, L", "Swinnen, SP", "Wenderoth, N"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) is an important mechanism to maximize the independent functioning of each hemisphere and is most likely mediated by transcallosal fibres. IHI can be investigated by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) whereby, in half of the trials, a test stimulus (TS) over one hemisphere is preceded by a conditioning stimulus (CS) over the other hemisphere. Whereas various studies have investigated IHI in rest, less is known about interhemispheric interactions during voluntary muscle activation. Here, we investigated the influence of tonic muscle activity (5% of the maximal voluntary contraction) in either the right wrist flexor or extensor versus rest on IHI from the active (left) to the resting (right) hemisphere. Our main finding was that tonic activation of the right wrist flexor, led to an increase in IHI from the active (dominant left) to the resting (non-dominant right) hemisphere as compared to rest. A control experiment employed the same design but CS intensity was lowered to match MEP amplitudes of the conditioning hand between active and rest conditions. This resulted in a relative decrease of IHI. It is hypothesized that functional regulation of IHI might prevent the occurrence of mirror activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) of the resting hemisphere and, thus, might play an important role in the execution of unimanual actions.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Corticospinal-evoked responses in lower limb muscles during voluntary contractions at varying strengths.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "2789820", "authors": ["Oya, T", "Hoffman, BW", "Cresswell, AG"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "This study investigated corticospinal-evoked responses in lower limb muscles during voluntary contractions at varying strengths. Similar investigations have been made on upper limb muscles, where evoked responses have been shown to increase up to approximately 50% of maximal force and then decline. We elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) in the soleus (Sol) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles using magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex and cervicomedullary junction during voluntary plantar flexions with the torque ranging from 0 to 100% of a maximal voluntary contraction. Differences between the MEP and CMEP were also investigated to assess whether any changes were occurring at the cortical or spinal levels. In both Sol and MG, MEP and CMEP amplitudes [normalized to maximal M wave (Mmax)] showed an increase, followed by a plateau, over the greater part of the contraction range with responses increasing from approximately 0.2 to approximately 6% of Mmax for Sol and from approximately 0.3 to approximately 10% of Mmax for MG. Because both MEPs and CMEPs changed in a similar manner, the observed increase and lack of decrease at high force levels are likely related to underlying changes occurring at the spinal level. The evoked responses in the Sol and MG increase over a greater range of contraction strengths than for upper limb muscles, probably due to differences in the pattern of motor unit recruitment and rate coding for these muscles and the strength of the corticospinal input.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Hemispheric asymmetry of hand representation in human primary somatosensory cortex and handedness.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "8293277", "authors": ["Jung, P", "Baumg\u00e4rtner, U", "Magerl, W", "Treede, RD"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To evaluate interhemispheric differences of hand representation in primary somatosensory (SI) and motor (MI) cortices and its relation to handedness.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Electrophysiological correlates of motor conversion disorder.", "keywords": [], "issue": "15", "pmid": "8207487", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Hassa, T", "T\u00fcscher, O", "Schmidt, R"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "MRI-based EEG dipole source analysis was performed separately for early (P14, N20, P22) and middle/late latency (P30, N60, N110) SEP components after left and right median nerve stimulation.
