We tested in healthy subjects whether Laser-PAS elicits cortical plasticity as reflected by long-term changes in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) (after-effects). In separate experiments, we examined numerous variables including changes induced by varying the interstimulus intervals (ISIs) and Laser-PAS-induced changes in target and non-target muscle MEPs. We measured MEPs after repetitive laser or TMS (rTMS) pulses, and compared magnetic- and electric (TES)-induced MEPs. We tested MEPs after applying Laser-PAS with laser pulses ipsilaterally to M1. Finally, we studied subjects receiving an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (memantine) or placebo (\u03b1-lipoic acid). During Laser-PAS at the 50 ms ISI MEPs decreased, thereafter they increased for 60 min; other ISIs induced no after-effects. The after-effects remained restricted to the target muscle. Repetitive laser pulses and rTMS induced no after-effects. After Laser-PAS, TMS-induced MEPs increased, whereas TES-induced MEPs did not. Laser-PAS with laser pulses ipsilaterally to M1 left MEPs unchanged. Memantine, but not \u03b1-lipoic acid, abolished the after-effects. In conclusion, Laser-PAS elicits NMDA-dependent cortical plasticity and provides new insights into human pain-motor integration.", "pages": "1942-51"}, {"volume": "168 Suppl 3", "title": "[Non-medicinal treatments of spasticity in multiple sclerosis].", "keywords": ["EEG", "TES", "alpha", "parietal cortex", "tDCS", "working memory", "working memory capacity"], "issue": "", "pmid": "22721366", "authors": ["Mailhan, L", "Papeix, C"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Revue neurologique", "abstract": "Non-medicinal treatments of spasticity may be proposed in patients with multiple sclerosis as either an adjunct to pharmacological treatments or the first line of treatment.

Despite its success, there are significant limitations to its application, including incompatibility with magnetic resonance imaging, limited control of electric fields and decreased performance associated with tissue inflammation. Magnetic stimulation overcomes these limitations but existing devices (that is, transcranial magnetic stimulation) are large, reducing their translation to chronic applications. In addition, existing devices are not effective for deeper, sub-cortical targets. Here we demonstrate that sub-millimeter coils can activate neuronal tissue. Interestingly, the results of both modelling and physiological experiments suggest that different spatial orientations of the coils relative to the neuronal tissue can be used to generate specific neural responses. These results raise the possibility that micro-magnetic stimulation coils, small enough to be implanted within the brain parenchyma, may prove to be an effective alternative to existing stimulation devices.", "pages": "1942-51"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Noradrenergic modulation of human visual cortex excitability assessed by paired-pulse visual-evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "17250719", "authors": ["H\u00f6ffken, O", "Lenz, M", "H\u00f6ckelmann, N", "Dinse, HR", "Tegenthoff, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Paired-pulse paradigms are common tools to explore excitability in the human cortex. Although the underlying mechanisms of intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the motor system assessed by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation are well understood, little is known about the physiology of excitability in the human cortex measured by paired-pulse visual-evoked potentials (VEPs). We therefore aimed to explore the noradrenergic influence on paired-pulse VEPs. We recorded and analysed VEPs following a single and paired-pulse stimulation in healthy individuals before and after they received single doses of 60 mg atomoxetine and in a control group. Paired-pulse suppression was expressed as a ratio of the amplitudes of the second and the first peaks. We found that the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine reduced paired-pulse suppression significantly, indicating a facilitatory effect on visual cortex excitability, whereas in the control group, no significant effects were found. Single-pulse VEPs were unaffected. We conclude that single-dose atomoxetine is able to increase excitability in the visual cortex, indicating an involvement of the noradrenergic system.", "pages": "1942-51"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "[Non-invasive brain stimulation for relieving acute and chronic pain].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5-6", "pmid": "18816422", "authors": ["Csifcs\u00e1k, G", "Antal, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Ideggy\u00f3gy\u00e1szati szemle", "abstract": "Controlling pain has always been one of the biggest challenges of medical science. Despite pharmacological developments, still many patients suffer from long-lasting pain. During the last 40 years several surgical interventions have been used to modulate the activity of the central nervous system in order to control chronic, pharmacoresistant pain. Because such interventions may involve very serious adverse events, safer and at least equally efficient methods are still required. In the 90's new techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation have been introduced that enable the facilitation or inhibition of distinct cortical areas. These methods are based on the electrical stimulation of brain structures and to date they have been successfully used to modulate perceptual, cognitive and motor functions in healthy subjects and various diseases as well. In this review we describe such techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation, namely repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation and review the current literature about their efficacy in controlling acute and chronic pain.", "pages": "1942-51"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Behavioral and electrophysiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation of the parietal cortex in a visuo-spatial working memory task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "11835450", "authors": ["Heimrath, K", "Sandmann, P", "Becke, A", "M\u00fcller, NG", "Zaehle, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "abstract": "Impairments of working memory (WM) performance are frequent concomitant symptoms in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases. Despite the great advance in treating the reduced WM abilities in patients suffering from, e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the exact neurophysiological underpinning subserving these therapeutic tDCS-effects are still unknown. In the present study we investigated the impact of tDCS on performance in a visuo-spatial WM task and its underlying neural activity. In three experimental sessions, participants performed a delayed matching-to-sample WM task after sham, anodal, and cathodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex. The results showed that tDCS modulated WM performance and its underlying electrophysiological brain activity in a polarity-specific way. Parietal tDCS altered event-related potentials and oscillatory power in the alpha band at posterior electrode sites. The present study demonstrates that posterior tDCS can alter visuo-spatial WM performance by modulating the underlying neural activity. This result can be considered an important step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in tDCS-induced modulations of cognitive processing.

They can also interact with processes of normal learning, to increase or decrease the rate of learning and retention. These features have spurred a number of investigators to test whether there is any clinical therapeutic potential for the methods to improve recovery of function after damage to the brain by injury or disease. The only condition where there is sufficient evidence is in certain forms of depression where excitatory rTMS is a recommended treatment protocol; there is insufficient evidence for any other condition. The problem facing investigators is the variety of possible paradigms that can be applied. Particularly for tDCS, only a small range of possible parameters has been tested, even in healthy volunteers; in addition, it is unclear whether stimulation should be applied at the same time as a behavioral therapy or whether stimulation should be applied at rest. Present trials give some evidence that can be used to address these questions, but until they are answered more securely it will be difficult to reach a consensus about \"standard\" protocols that can then be tested widely in multicenter trials.", "pages": "1942-51"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Preoperative multimodal motor mapping: a comparison of magnetoencephalography imaging, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation, and direct cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "14741588", "authors": ["Tarapore, PE", "Tate, MC", "Findlay, AM", "Honma, SM", "Mizuiri, D", "Berger, MS", "Nagarajan, SS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) is the gold-standard technique for motor mapping during craniotomy.
