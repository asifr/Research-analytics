The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with executive functions, such as task set switching. One important experimental paradigm for investigating such higher order cognitive control is the task-switching (TS) paradigm. A TS paradigm requires switching between two conditional response tasks with mutually incompatible response-selection rules. In the present study, the influence of HF rTMS over the right DLPFC in healthy female volunteers on a modified TS paradigm was investigated. As expected, reaction time on cued switching trials decreased significant after rTMS, as compared to non-cued switch trials. No changes emerged after the placebo sham condition. Mood remained unchanged after rTMS. These findings demonstrate the role of the right DLPFC in cued intentional set switch initiation.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "96", "title": "Associative plasticity in human motor cortex during voluntary muscle contraction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16723411", "authors": ["Kujirai, K", "Kujirai, T", "Sinkjaer, T", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "TMS pulses over the hand area of motor cortex activate different subpopulations of synaptic connections if the direction of the induced current in the brain is reversed from posterior-anterior (PA) direction to anterior-posterior (AP). We tested whether this also made a difference to the after-effects of paired associative stimulation (PAS: ulnar nerve stimulation followed 25 ms later by a transcranial magnetic stimulation pulse). If 50 pairs of stimuli (0.1 Hz) were applied using conventional suprathreshold PA-PAS in resting subjects, there was no effect on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the first dorsal interosseous muscle. In contrast if the same number of pulses were given while subjects made a small tonic (5% maximum) contraction, MEPs were facilitated and resting motor threshold reduced when AP but not PA pulses were used. Subsequent experiments employed subthreshold TMS (95% of the active motor threshold) during voluntary muscle contraction. MEP facilitation accompanied by reduced AP threshold occurred when PAS was given using AP pulses (AP-Sub-PAS), whereas PAS using PA pulses (PA-Sub-PAS) had no excitatory effect. There was no facilitation if the ulnar nerve stimulus was replaced by digital nerve stimulation. There was a tendency for short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) to decrease and intracortical facilitation (ICF) to increase after AP-Sub-PAS. We propose that the increased effectiveness of AP-Sub-PAS over PA-Sub-PAS is due to the fact that AP TMS more readily activates I3 inputs to corticospinal neurons and hence that these are an important component of associative plasticity in the human motor cortex.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Electrophysiological deterioration over time in patients with Huntington's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "16721731", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP", "M\u00e9nard-Lefaucheur, I", "Maison, P", "Baudic, S", "Cesaro, P", "Peschanski, M", "Bachoud-L\u00e9vi, AC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "In recent studies aimed at assessing the effects of original therapeutic strategies applied to patients with Huntington's disease (HD), we observed informative changes in electrophysiological results that recovered normal values in coherence with clinical improvement. However, longitudinal studies were lacking for determining whether electrophysiological test results evolve in parallel with clinical markers of the natural course of the disease and could consequently provide objective quantifiable markers of disease progression. For this purpose, electrophysiological testing was performed annually in a cohort of 20 patients with HD over a 2-year period (three examinations). The study included the recording of sympathetic skin responses and blink reflexes (BRs) to supraorbital nerve stimulation, long latency reflexes (LLRs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median nerve stimulation, and cortical silent periods (CSPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Clinical evaluation was based on the Total Functional Capacity scale (TFC) and the Motor part of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). A significant deterioration with time was found for BR latency, LLR presence, various SEP parameters (parietal N20 peak amplitude and frontal N30 presence) and CSP duration. Attenuation of the N20 peak and CSP shortening correlated with functional decline, as assessed by the TFC score, whereas delayed BR and LLR abolition correlated with UHDRS Motor score deterioration. This study shows that several electrophysiological parameters are closely associated with dysfunction of various neural circuits in HD and could be useful markers of disease progression.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "102", "title": "The role of the craniospinal nerves in mediating the antinociceptive effect of transcranial electrostimulation in the rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "16717325", "authors": ["Nekhendzy, V", "Davies, MF", "Lemmens, HJ", "Maze, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Transcranial electrostimulation (TES) has been reported to elicit significant analgesia, but its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. In a recently introduced clinically relevant rat model of TES we have validated and characterized the TES antinociceptive effect, suggesting involvement of the sensory nerves of the rat's scalp in mediating that effect. In this study, we have further investigated the role of the craniospinal nerves by attempting to block the TES antinociceptive effect with local anesthetic injected under the TES electrodes. We also applied different transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation modalities through the TES electrodes and compared the elicited antinociceptive effect to that of TES. The antinociceptive effect was assessed by measuring nociceptive thresholds in the tail-flick latency test in awake, unrestrained male rats. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni t-test. The TES antinociceptive effect was significantly reduced after local anesthetic injection, and administration of 100 Hz transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was, over time, capable of eliciting the same degree of antinociceptive effect as TES. We conclude that sensory craniospinal nerves play a critical role in mediating the TES antinociceptive action and offer a hypothesis on the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for this action.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "1095", "title": "Lateralization of unimanual and bimanual motor imagery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16713588", "authors": ["Stinear, CM", "Fleming, MK", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Most studies of motor imagery have examined motor cortex function during imagery of dominant hand movement. The aim of this study was to examine the modulation of excitability in the dominant and non-dominant corticomotor pathways during kinesthetic motor imagery of unimanual and bimanual movement. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the contralateral motor cortex (M1) to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles of each hand, in two separate sessions. Transcutaneous electrical stimuli were also delivered to the median nerve at each wrist, to elicit F-waves from APB. Fifteen right-handed volunteers imagined unimanual and bimanual phasic thumb movements, paced with a 1-Hz auditory metronome. Stimuli were delivered at rest, and either 50 ms before (ON phase), or 450 ms after (OFF phase), the metronome beeps. Significant MEP amplitude facilitation occurred only in right APB, during the ON phase of motor imagery of the right hand and both hands. Significant temporal modulation of right APB MEP amplitude was observed during motor imagery of right, left and bimanual performance. F-wave persistence and amplitude were unaffected by imagery. These results demonstrate that the motor imagery is lateralized to the left (dominant) hemisphere, which is engaged by imagery of each hand separately, and bimanual imagery. This finding has implications for the use of motor imagery in rehabilitation.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "MEG and TMS combined with EEG for mapping alcohol effects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16713500", "authors": ["K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, S"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)", "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive method of studying magnetic fields from outside the skull that are generated by at least partially synchronized neuronal populations in the brain. The advantage of MEG over electroencephalography (EEG) is the transparency of the skull, scalp, and brain tissue to the magnetic fields, which facilitates easy localization of the cortical activity. In MEG, alcohol increased the relative power of the alpha rhythm and reduced the relative power of beta activity in parieto-occipital regions. In contrast, no changes were observed in EEG, indicating that these methods differently detect alcohol's action on the cortex. Furthermore, MEG and EEG also differently detected the effects of alcohol on cognition. Alcohol reduced magnetic and electric auditory N1 and mismatch negativity amplitudes. P3a amplitudes were also reduced in EEG but not in MEG, suggesting that different cortical areas are responsible for alcohol's action on involuntary attention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides new possibilities for studying localized changes in the electrical properties of the human cortex, especially when combined with EEG. Different cortical areas can be stimulated and the subsequent brain activity can be measured, yielding information about cortical excitability and connectivity. Alcohol modulates EEG responses evoked by motor-cortex TMS, the effects being largest at the right prefrontal cortex (assessed by minimum-norm estimation), meaning that alcohol changed the functional connectivity between motor and prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, alcohol decreases amplitudes of EEG responses after the left prefrontal stimulation of anterior parts of the cortex, which may be associated with the decrease of prefrontal cortical excitability. Taken together, MEG and TMS combined with EEG provide new insight into the focal actions of alcohol on the cortex with a temporal resolution of milliseconds, giving information different from that given by other brain imaging modalities.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "The excitability of the trigeminal motor system in sleep bruxism: a transcranial magnetic stimulation and brainstem reflex study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16708832", "authors": ["Gastaldo, E", "Quatrale, R", "Graziani, A", "Eleopra, R", "Tugnoli, V", "Tola, MR", "Granieri, E"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of orofacial pain", "abstract": "Since sleep bruxism (SB) is characterized by grinding and clenching of the teeth during sleep and could be an exaggerated manifestation of normal spontaneous rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, the aim of this study was to obtain a neurophysiological assessment of the excitability of the central jaw motor pathways in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of SB.", "pages": "561-5"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "The role of human extra-striate visual areas V5/MT and V2/V3 in the perception of the direction of global motion: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16708244", "authors": ["Cowey, A", "Campana, G", "Walsh, V", "Vaina, LM"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
