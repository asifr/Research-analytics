Dysfunction of dopamine plays a role in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug addiction. It is released in the striatum when dopamine neurons in the midbrain undergo burst firing. Several animal studies have shown that dopamine can also be released under direct control of glutamatergic corticostriatal efferents. However, the existence and physiological significance of this mode of action remain controversial. We have shown previously that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the human prefrontal cortex led to focal dopamine release in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus, supporting the corticostriatal mode of dopamine release. Using the same experimental approach, we sought to confirm this hypothesis. We used [11C]raclopride and PET to measure changes in extracellular dopamine concentration following rTMS of the motor cortex in six healthy human subjects. rTMS of the left primary motor cortex caused a reduction in [11C]raclopride binding in the left putamen compared with rTMS of the left occipital cortex. There were no changes in binding in the right putamen, caudate nucleus or nucleus accumbens. The area of statistically significant change in binding corresponded closely to the known projection zone of corticostriatal efferents originating in monkey motor cortex. This finding has implications for the functional role of subcortical dopamine.", "pages": "2609-15"}, {"volume": "126", "title": "Patients with focal arm dystonia have increased sensitivity to slow-frequency repetitive TMS of the dorsal premotor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 12", "pmid": "12937071", "authors": ["Siebner, HR", "Filipovic, SR", "Rowe, JB", "Cordivari, C", "Gerschlager, W", "Rothwell, JC", "Frackowiak, RS", "Bhatia, KP"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "We used PET to examine the pattern and time course of changes produced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in healthy subjects and in patients with primary focal dystonia. Subjects received 1800 stimuli of subthreshold 1 Hz rTMS or sham stimulation to the left PMd. Afterwards, we measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a marker of synaptic activity at rest and during performance of freely selected random finger movement. In both groups of subjects, real rTMS caused widespread bilateral decreases in neuronal activity in prefrontal, premotor, primary motor cortex, and left putamen. Conversely, rCBF in the cerebellum increased. Effects were equivalent at rest and during movement, indicating that the pattern of movement-related activation did not change. rTMS-induced changes in neuronal activity lasted for at least 1 h except in the medial aspect of the left globus pallidus. Conditioning effects on neuronal activity were larger in the patients than in the healthy subjects: there was a greater decrease of rCBF in lateral and medial premotor areas, putamen, and thalamus, including the stimulated premotor cortex, and a larger increase in cerebellar rCBF. Our findings indicate that, in healthy subjects and patients with dystonia, a single session of rTMS can produce powerful and widespread changes in regional synaptic activity as indexed by rCBF. Since the greater effects of premotor rTMS were not related to any differences in task performance, increased responsiveness of the motor system to rTMS reveals a physiological trait that characterizes patients with focal arm dystonia.", "pages": "2609-15"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Focused high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for localisation of the unexposed primary motor cortex during brain tumour surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "12933937", "authors": ["Rohde, V", "Mayfrank, L", "Weinzierl, M", "Krings, T", "Gilsbach, JM"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "To investigate if intraoperative focused high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can localise the primary motor cortex without exposure of the cortical surface.", "pages": "2609-15"}, {"volume": "72", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the reversal of motor conversion disorder.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "10378741", "authors": ["Sch\u00f6nfeldt-Lecuona, C", "Connemann, BJ", "Spitzer, M", "Herwig, U"], "year": "", "journal": "Psychotherapy and psychosomatics", "abstract": "A high frequency train (357 Hz) of four suprathreshold magnetic stimuli was delivered transcranially to the region of the rolandic area during brain tumour operations in 12 patients.
