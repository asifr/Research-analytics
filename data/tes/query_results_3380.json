Here we attempt to clarify the situation in normal subjects by comparing the various methods which have been used. EMG responses evoked by magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex could be suppressed by a prior magnetic stimulus over the cerebellum but the onset latency of the effect varied according to the type of magnetic coil used. Inhibition began at a latency which ranged from 5 to 9 msec in different subjects if conditioning stimuli were given through a flat figure-of-eight coil held horizontally over the basal occiput. The effect lasted a further 6-10 msec. With a larger double cone coil, held vertically over the basal occiput, inhibition began earlier and at a more constant latency of 5 msec. It lasted only 3 msec. Stimulation of the C6/7 nerve roots in the brachial plexus with either an electrical or magnetic stimulus also could suppress EMG responses evoked by cortical stimulation. This began at a conditioning-test interval of 7 or 8 msec and lasted for some 5 msec. We suggest that two types of motor cortical suppression may be elicited from stimulation over the posterior neck/skull: a cerebellar effect starting at 5 msec, and a peripheral nerve effect starting later at 7/8 msec. Stimulation with a horizontal large figure-of-eight coil may produce a mixture of effects because the lower wing of the coil overlaps the posterior neck and can activate peripheral nerve fibres in the brachial plexus.", "pages": "58-66"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Corticospinal direct response to transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8625877", "authors": ["Fujiki, M", "Isono, M", "Hori, S", "Ueno, S"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex was investigated in comparison with the direct (D) response to electrical stimulation of the exposed motor cortex from the spinal epidural space in 7 neurologically normal patients during brain tumor surgery.

The magnetic induced D response showed a conduction velocity of 50.5-72.7 m/sec and was resistant to anesthesia and unaffected by muscle relaxants and tolerant to high frequency (500 Hz) paired magnetic stimulus, and the latencies of magnetic MEPs corresponded to those with direct electrical stimulation.

The motor units were recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscles of 12 patients with ALS, 14 healthy subjects, 12 patients with upper motor neuron lesions and 9 with pure lower motor neuron diseases. More than 100 magnetic stimuli were delivered over the scalp during minimal muscle contraction. The occurrence of motor unit discharges was plotted in a peristimulus time histogram. An increase in discharge probability at latencies of 20-30 msec, that represents monosynaptic activation (primary peak) was found in normal units. Motor units from ALS patients with short disease durations had significantly increased discharge probabilities in the primary peak (P < 0.001). Motor units from 4 ALS patients with upper motor neuron signs showed double primary peaks: an initial synchronized peak followed by a dispersed peak. The latter was ascribed to a slow corticospinal pathway, which remains undetected or is functionally insignificant in healthy subjects.

This paper describes the effects of subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation on the F-waves evoked in hand and foot muscles. In the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, the F-wave was significantly enhanced when the cortical stimulus was given with a delay corresponding approximately to the expected time of collision, i.e., the difference between the mean latency of the F-wave and the mean latency of the motor evoked potential. A second, usually larger facilitatory phase follows the first phase after 2-3 msec, and later peaks of enhancement often occurred. After the enhancement periods, a significant inhibition of the F-wave was usually observed. In the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, the first facilitatory phase was observed some milliseconds earlier than expected in 4 of 5 subjects, and the inhibitory phase was less pronounced. We argue that the sequential arrival of I-waves at the spinal segment could be responsible for the changes observed in the F-wave recorded from the small hand muscle. In the foot muscle, anatomical and technical factors could contribute to the generation of a D-wave. The strong inhibition observed in the F-wave recorded from the hand muscle is likely to be due to the arrival on alpha-motoneurons of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) generated by the cortical stimulus. Our data show that the F-wave ia a probe for changes in the spinal cord excitatory state.", "pages": "58-66"}, {"volume": "119 ( Pt 1)", "title": "Cortical inhibition in Parkinson's disease.

Paired stimuli were delivered at short (3-20 ms) as well as long (100-250 ms) intervals during slight voluntary contraction. The intensity of the conditioning stimulus was subthreshold (80%) at short, and suprathreshold (150%) at long intervals. In addition, the silent period following a single magnetic shock given at 150% of threshold was measured. With short interstimulus intervals, no significant difference between patients and normal subjects could be detected. With long interstimulus intervals, the test response was significantly more inhibited in patients than in normal subjects. Although the cortical silent period was found to be slightly shorter, the recovery of motor evoked potentials was incomplete in patients with Parkinson's disease. This alteration could be partially reverted in dopaminergic therapy. In conclusion, the responsiveness of motor cortices to suprathreshold magnetic stimuli delivered after the end of the silent period is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease, possibly due to prolonged activity in intracortical inhibitory circuits. The positive effect of L-dopa suggests that dopaminergic modulation of cortical activity, most probably at basal ganglia level, is involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon.", "pages": "58-66"}, {"volume": "119 ( Pt 1)", "title": "Abnormalities of the balance between inhibition and excitation in the motor cortex of patients with cortical myoclonus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "8624691", "authors": ["Brown, P", "Ridding, MC", "Werhahn, KJ", "Rothwell, JC", "Marsden, CD"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Patients with cortical myoclonus may have purely focal or multifocal jerks, or they may have additional bilateral or generalized jerks, suggesting the spread of excitatory myoclonic activity between the cerebral hemispheres and across the sensorimotor cortex. The factors contributing to this spread of activity were investigated in 10 patients with multifocal cortical myoclonus and eight patients with multifocal and bilateral or generalized cortical myoclonus. The two groups were termed 'non- spreaders' and 'spreaders' respectively. Eight of the patients were also epileptic. Motor thresholds to single transcranial magnetic shocks at rest were higher in 'non- spreaders' (median 88%, range 45-100% of stimulator output) than either 'spreaders' (50%, range 26-90%, P=0.023) or health controls (38%, range 28-53%, P<0.001). This pathological elevation in motor threshold was not simply an effect of treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Paired transcranial magnetic stimuli were used to investigate ipsilateral cortico-cortical and transcallosal inhibition, There was less (MANOVA, P<0.05) ipsilateral inhibition at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-6 ms in 'spreaders' (mean 107+/-SEM 23% of control) compared with 'non- spreaders' (75+/-15%) or healthy subjects (59+/-10%). There was also less (P<0.05) transcallosal inhibition across inhibitory timings (10, 12 and 14 ms) in the 'spreaders' (98+/-6% of control) compared with the 'non-spreaders' (64+/-8%) or healthy subjects (59+/-6%). There was no relationship between ipsilateral cortico-cortical and transcallosal inhibition and the presence or absence of epilepsy, although non-epileptic patients did have higher motor thresholds (median 85%, range 32-100% of stimulator output) than either epileptic patients (50%, range 26-90%, P<0.001) or healthy controls (38%, range 28-53%, P=0.002). Abnormalities in ipsilateral and transcallosal inhibition appear to facilitate the spread of the cortical myoclonic activity responsible for bilateral and generalized jerks.
