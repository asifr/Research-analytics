Presently, we compared the effects of 8 daily treatments with TMS (t = 5 min, B = 0.1 T, trise = 200 microseconds, f = 50 Hz) and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) (t = 0.5 s, I = 150 mA, f = 50 Hz) on the behavior of rats in the forced swimming test (24 h after the last treatment), the exploratory activity test (0-10 min), the basal locomotor activity test (11-30 min), and the tail flick test (2 h after the last treatment). We also tested (24 h after the treatment) the reactivity of the cyclic AMP generating system in cerebral cortical slices. Statistical significance of the results was estimated by ANOVA and t-Student test. The immobility time in the forced swimming test was shortened after TMS and ECS to 86 and 75% of control values, respectively (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Both ECS and TMS depressed the basal locomotor activity (by 60 and 80%, resp.), and ECS, but not TMS, diminished also the exploratory activity by 70% (p < 0.01) only ECS induces analgesia, prolonging tail-flick latency by 90% (p < 0.01). ECS diminished the accumulation of the noradrenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP in the cortex slices (by 35%; p < 0.05). The effect after TMS was similar but statistically not significant (87% of control values). The data suggest that TMS produces in rats some responses that are regarded as predictive for the antidepressant activity, similar to those produced by ECS, but less side effects.", "pages": "611-28"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Stiff-man syndrome: abnormal late responses upon transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "8965855", "authors": ["Schulte-Mattler, WJ", "Zierz, S"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Cortical excitability to magnetic stimulation was investigated interictally in 10 patients with migraine with aura, 10 with migraine without aura and in 10 healthy volunteers.

The experimental design incorporated a previous observation that stimulation of afferents in the superficial radial nerve inhibits propriospinal-like neurones projecting to the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle. Surface EMG responses were recorded from the active ECR muscle after transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex. In random trials, single conditioning stimuli at twice perceptual threshold were given to the superficial radial nerve at the wrist at different times before a cortical shock. When the cortex was stimulated electrically, the conditioning stimulus suppressed the EMG responses when the interval between the shocks was 11 ms or more. This was about 3.5 ms longer than the minimum time calculated for a possible direct cutaneous effect on spinal motoneurones. The time course of suppression began earlier and was more complex during magnetic stimulation of the cortex. It is argued that this difference is due to the repetitive I waves generated by the magnetic shock. Whether electrical or magnetic stimulation was used, the first 1-3 ms of the EMG response was relatively unaffected by superficial radial nerve stimulation at any interstimulus interval, whereas clear suppression was seen in the later portion of the response. In contrast, if the EMG response in ECR was suppressed by a conditioning stimulus to the median nerve at the elbow, then all portions of the EMG response were inhibited including the first 1-3 ms. The median nerve effect is thought to be due to direct reciprocal inhibition of the extensor motoneurones. Thus sparing of the initial part of the cortically evoked response with superficial radial stimulation suggests that the latter type of inhibition occurs at a premotoneuronal level. The timing of the effect is compatible with the explanation that corticospinal excitation is produced in ECR motoneurones through both monosynaptic and disynaptic (including propriospinal premotoneuronal) pathways, with superficial radial nerve inhibition being exerted at the propriospinal level.", "pages": "611-28"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "A propriospinal-like contribution to electromyographic responses evoked in wrist extensor muscles by transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "8817280", "authors": ["Mazevet, D", "Pierrot-Deseilligny, E", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In experiments using paired transcranial stimuli, the conditioning shock inhibited the test response to a similar extent with and without diazepam. Although baclofen did not change the cortical silent period, it reduced the size of the H reflex in the forearm muscles. Thiopental also left the duration of the cortical silent period unchanged.

Using a figure of eight coil, TMS was delivered over multiple scalp sites during a low level voluntary contraction of the left first dorsal interosseous muscle. At near-threshold intensity, early or late surface electromyograph (EMG) components (relative to anodal response latency) could be preferentially evoked with the coil aligned in a medio-lateral (ML), antero-posterior (AP), or postero-anterior (PA) orientation. The optimal location of the earliest component with ML coil orientation was 8 mm medial and 5 mm anterior compared to a later component with AP orientation. The optimal location for the same latency EMG component mapped using two different coil orientations (AP and ML) was not significantly different. The optimal location of two different late components, one obtained with AP and the other with PA coil orientations, was similar.
