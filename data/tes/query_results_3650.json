The main benefits are a reduced requirement for analgesic drugs, especially opiates, and a long-lasting postoperative analgesia. We have confirmed these clinical observations in rats using the tail-flick latency (TFL) test to measure pain threshold. TCES was not found to modify the pain threshold in drug-free rats, but it potentiated morphine-induced analgesia (systemic injection). To obtain a maximal effect, the stimulation must be initiated 3 h before the drug injection and be maintained throughout the duration of its pharmacological action. TCES potentitation was found to depend on the dose of the drug, the intensity of the current and the polarity of electrodes. These findings were confirmed by blind tests of the efficiency of TCES on several opiate analgesic drugs currently used in human surgery (morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil and dextromoramide). The analgesic effect of these 4 opiates (TFL as % of baseline without or with TCES) were respectively: 174%, 306%; 176%, 336%; 160%, 215%; and 267%, 392%. The results were obtained not only after systemic opiate treatment, but also after intracerebroventricular injection of morphine (10 micrograms; analgesic effect 152%, 207% with TCES) suggesting that TCES potentiation of opiate-induced analgesia is centrally mediated.", "pages": "309-11"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Transcranial electrical stimulation with high frequency intermittent current (Limoge's) potentiates opiate-induced analgesia: blind studies.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "2250924", "authors": ["Stinus, L", "Auriacombe, M", "Tignol, J", "Limoge, A", "Le Moal, M"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "1. This study used three techniques (bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation, motor cortex stimulation and quantitative electromyography) to assess the degree of activation of the diaphragm, intercostal-accessory muscles and abdominal muscles during postural tasks and respiratory manoeuvres. They included maximal inspiratory and expulsive efforts. 2. Bilateral phrenic nerve stimuli at supramaximal levels produced an average change in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) of 28 cmH2O during relaxation. During maximal inspiratory or expulsive efforts, all subjects were able to activate the diaphragm fully at functional residual capacity as judged by the failure of stimuli delivered during the voluntary efforts to increase Pdi. Peak voluntary Pdi was about 30% less for inspiratory than expulsive manoeuvres. 3. By contrast, transcranial activation of motor cortical output to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles produced an increment in abdominal pressure of 25 +/- 7 cmH2O during maximal voluntary expulsive efforts. Given the lack of response to phrenic nerve stimulation at similar voluntary pressures, this suggests that abdominal muscles, and not the diaphragm, fail to generate their full contractile force during maximal voluntary expulsive manoeuvres. 4. Motor cortical stimulation during weak inspiratory efforts produced a small reduction in oesophageal pressure (i.e. increase in net inspiratory force) of 7-14 cmH2O. This response could not be extinguished during maximal voluntary inspiratory efforts in two of three subjects. This occurred despite the cortical co-activation of 'antagonist' muscles in the chest wall and abdomen, and passive transmission of pressure from the abdominal to thoracic compartments. 5. Integrated electromyographic activity (EMG) recorded from abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis, external oblique) was greater during trunk flexion than during maximal expulsive efforts. Similarly, integrated EMG of the intercostal-accessory muscles (sternomastoid, scalenes, parasternal intercostals) was greater during tasks requiring head and/or neck flexion than during the maximal inspiratory efforts. 6. These data show that the diaphragm can be fully activated by the central nervous system during voluntary respiratory tasks but that other agonist 'respiratory' muscles need not be activated fully. Given the complex actions of 'inseries' respiratory muscles revealed here, it is argued that differences in the transdiaphragmatic pressure during various postural and respiratory tasks do not necessarily imply variation in the level of diaphragmatic neural drive.", "pages": "309-11"}, {"volume": "428", "title": "Activation of human respiratory muscles during different voluntary manoeuvres.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "2231418", "authors": ["Gandevia, SC", "McKenzie, DK", "Plassman, BL"], "year": "1990", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (MEP) were examined in 33 patients within three days after stroke.

To date this technique has appeared safe. The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical application of this method in patients with Bell's palsy. Electromyographic responses were elicited by electrical and magnetic transcranial stimulation of the facial nerve in 26 patients affected by Bell's palsy. Electrical stimulation: stimuli of 0.1 ms duration, and up to 15 V, were delivered through surface electrodes set 2.5 cm apart over the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen. Magnetic stimulation: the coil was placed tangent to the parieto-occipital surface of the scalp. The stimulus intensity was then increased stepwise until a supramaximal response was obtained. Recording: the focal recording electrode was placed ipsilateral to the side stimulated over the superior orbicularis oculi; the reference electrode was placed over the nasal bone. The patients were tested with two neurophysiological determinations: the first 15-30 days from the onset of the palsy; the second 30-60 days after the first. A clinical follow-up was performed six months after the second determination. The results indicate that, contrary to traditional electroneurography, transcranial magnetic stimulation is not able to supply useful neurophysiological indications in patients with Bell's palsy.

With the stimulation coil (Magstim 200, Novametrix) centered conventionally over the midline of the skull convexity and using high stimulus intensities, which are often required in pathological states, the motor cortices of both hemispheres are usually activated simultaneously. Under this condition it is not possible to determine from which hemisphere the descending excitatory volleys to a particular motoneurone pool originate and how the input to the lower motoneurons is organized (uni-/bilateral, ipsi-/contralateral). This limitation can be overcome by two different techniques for selective stimulation of the motor cortex of one hemisphere without coactivation of the other even when using maximal stimulus intensities: 1. A large 12 cm (outer diameter) stimulation coil could be used for selective stimulation when a) the magnetic field radiated over the non-stimulated hemisphere is modified by using a prototype coil shield covering the half of the coil over the nonstimulated hemisphere in combination with b) placing the coil away from the midline towards the preferentially excited hemisphere. The coil shield consists of a sheet of a nickel iron alloy which alters the time course of the induced currents by reducing the initial rate of current intensity change (dI/dt). 2. The use of a smaller 6.5 cm (outer diameter) coil also provided a useful tool for selective stimulation of one hemisphere but was restricted to subjects with low excitation thresholds.

Previous studies have shown that signals produced by threshold stimulation travel mostly in the corticospinal tract. However, from this study we show that suprathreshold stimulation produces very large amplitude MEPs which travel in the ventral funiculus and therefore are most likely associated with extrapyramidal tract activation. The data supporting this conclusion are: (1) apparent conduction velocities of the first two large amplitude peaks are at least 80 m/s with transcranial stimulation; (2) latency of the transcranial MEP at L2 in the cord is less than or equal to 3.50 ms; (3) large amplitude, positive monophasic potentials are recorded in the ventral but not dorsal-lateral funiculus for either bipolar or transcranial MEPs; (4) both bipolar and transcranial MEPs are significantly reduced or abolished by selective lesion of the ventral funiculus. The two tracts which we believe are responsible for mediating the suprathreshold MEP in the cat are the reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts. This is significant because suprathreshold MEPs can be used to monitor feline ventral cord function.
