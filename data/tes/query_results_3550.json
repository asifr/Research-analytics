In twenty-two neurologically normal patients undergoing surgery for scoliosis, corticospinal volleys to transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex were recorded from the spinal cord using epidural electrodes. While anaesthesia was maintained by nitrous oxide and narcotics, volatile anaesthetics were withdrawn to determine whether such agents had a depressant effect on the evoked corticospinal volley. 2. Profound changes were documented in liminal D waves, there being an increase in amplitude averaging 392% following withdrawal of the volatile anaesthetic. There was a proportionately smaller increase (averaging 26%) in supraliminal D waves; these had a complex bifid or trifid shape indicating that some corticofugal axons were being activated deep to cortex. In general the effect on the D wave of withdrawing the anaesthetic agent was similar to that of increasing stimulus intensity. 3. Withdrawal of isoflurane dramatically increased the number of I waves and their mean amplitude. In the absence of isoflurane, I3 (mean latency 3.5 ms after the D wave) became the dominant I wave. The amplitude of I2 (mean latency 2.2 ms) became slightly smaller. The change in I waves could not be likened to an increase in stimulus intensity, because I waves invariably increase in, or remain of the same, amplitude as stimulus intensity is increased. 4. These findings indicate that changes in motor cortex excitability can result in major changes in the corticospinal volley produced by transcranial electrical stimulation, affecting both the D wave and I waves. They caution against identifying a cortical action solely on the basis of a change in the responses to magnetic stimulation of motor cortex but no such change to electrical stimulation.", "pages": "393-404"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "[Study of the facial nerve motor pathway with the transcranial cerebral magnetic stimulation technique].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1841949", "authors": ["Barona, R", "Escudero, J", "L\u00f3pez-Trigo, J", "Escudero, M", "Armengot, M"], "year": "", "journal": "Acta otorrinolaringol\u00f3gica espa\u00f1ola", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation method permits the study of the facial nerve in all its aspects (motor cortex-alpha moto-neurone-facial muscle) in an non invasive and painless way.

The MEPs-S recorded from the epidural electrode at the first lumbar (L1) level consisted of four negative peaks (N1, 2.56; N2, 3.19; N3, 4.06; N4, 4.99 ms) followed by small, multiphasic waves. The mean conduction velocities of N1-N3 of the MEPs-S were calculated to be 90 to 115 m/s, which is consistent with extrapyramidal tract activation. A direct brain stem electrical stimulation and sequential transection of the spinal cord studies showed that N1-N3 of the MEPs-S originated primarily from the brain stem and conducted in the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord, which corresponded to the extrapyramidal tracts (e.g., the reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts). We also showed that N1 and N2 of the MEPs-S originated mainly from the lower medulla or upper cervical and that N3 originated from the lower pons or upper medulla (vestibular nucleus). On the other hand, N4 of the MEPs-S had a conduction velocity of 70 m/s, which disappeared by ablation of the sensorimotor cortex and pyramidotomy. A dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord, resulting in the disappearance of N4 of the MEPs-S, indicated that it conducted in the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord. These results suggest that N4 of the MEPs-S originates from the sensorimotor cortex and conducts in the lateral corticospinal tract. MEPs-S by transcranial magnetic stimulation in cats constituted complex responses in both the pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts.", "pages": "393-404"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "The prognostic value of somatosensory and motor evoked potentials in comatose patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "2213580", "authors": ["Zentner, J", "Rohde, V"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials (SEP and MEP) were examined in a total of 213 patients in traumatic (n = 140) and nontraumatic (n = 73) coma.

According to the presence or absence of responses and the duration of central conduction time, SEP and MEP obtained during Days 1 through 3 after the onset of coma were divided into four categories and correlated with the outcome of the patients, as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Our results clearly show that in terms of prognostic value, SEP are superior to MEP, with normal findings indicating a favorable outcome and absent responses an unfavorable outcome. On the other hand, patients with normal electromyographic responses after both electrical and magnetoelectric stimulation had favorable and unfavorable outcomes about equally. Thus, unlike SEP, normal MEP do not allow any prognostic conclusions. Only the bilateral absence of MEP in response to electrical stimulation was a definitely unfavorable prognostic sign because all of these patients died. In contrast, with magnetoelectric stimulation, neither normal nor absent responses allowed any prognostic conclusions. Therefore, the prognostic value of electrically evoked motor responses is limited, and magnetoelectric stimulation cannot be recommended in this context.", "pages": "393-404"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Perineal motor potentials to magnetic stimulation, pudendal evoked potentials and perineal reflex in women.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "2213581", "authors": ["Ghezzi, A", "Callea, L", "Zaffaroni, M", "Zibetti, A", "Montanini, R"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Motor potentials to transcranial and lumbar magnetic stimulation were recorded from the perineum in 14 healthy women.

Spatial interaction between cortical inhibition of soleus motoneurons and inhibition evoked through identified spinal reflex machinery was investigated. 4. Interactions were found between cortically evoked inhibition and spinal Ia reciprocal inhibition, group I non-reciprocal inhibition and higher threshold components of longer latency reciprocal inhibition (D1 and D2 inhibitions). 5. Interactions were facilitatory when cortical and spinal inhibitory actions were weak and reversed to occlusion when both actions were strong. 6. It is concluded that the corticospinal pathway converges on the interneurones which subserve Ia reciprocal, group I non-reciprocal, D1 and D2 inhibition of soleus motoneurones. 7.

Isoflurane was administered to achieve end-tidal concentrations of 2%, 1% and 0% in all patients, and also of 1.5% and 0.5% in nine patients. Transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex was used to elicit descending volleys in corticospinal axons (the motor evoked potential). With stimuli of 450-750 V and no isoflurane, multiple I waves were always seen following the D wave. In all patients the number of I waves decreased and individual I waves became smaller in amplitude the greater the isoflurane concentration, but there were only minor changes in the D wave. The greatest depressant effect on I waves occurred at an end-tidal concentration of 0.5%. Given that I waves are an index of synaptic transmission, anaesthetic-induced changes in I waves may provide a useful model for the neuronal events underlying anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness.", "pages": "393-404"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Motor potentials of inferior orbicularis oculi muscle to transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Mean latency differences (delta) of masseter compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) (delta elREZ minus magStim) were 0.7 (range: +0.3 to +1.3) ms (P less than or equal to 0.05, Wilcoxon-test). From these results, an analysis of anatomical data, and using a trigeminal nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of 50 m/s as reported in the literature, the following conclusions were drawn: the excitation site to magStim (1) is variable among individuals, (2) is located 3.4 (1.6-6.5) cm distal to the trigeminal REZ, and (3) which corresponds to segments of the nerve that are located either within or outside the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), either proximal or distal to the foramen ovale.
