MEPs evoked by focal TMS were recorded in the relaxed opponens pollicis muscle and the size of the conditioned responses was expressed as a percentage of the size of the non-conditioned responses. Maximal ICI, ranging from 4 to 40%, and inhibition after median nerve stimulation, ranging from 11 to 68%, were significantly correlated. The results suggest that both phenomena are possibly mediated by the same gamma aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) inhibitory circuits and that afferent inputs to the cortex may contribute to their physiological activation.", "pages": "17-20"}, {"volume": "182", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation applications and potential use in chronic pain: studies in waiting.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11102633", "authors": ["Pridmore, S", "Oberoi, G"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a new technology which uses electromagnetic principles to produce small electrical currents in the cortex.

Although demonstrated in experimental animals, the existence of intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits in parietal sensory cortex has not been documented in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of paired TMS of the parietal cortex on contralateral tactile perception. Fifteen healthy subjects were involved in a task of discrimination of electrical stimuli delivered at near-threshold intensity of sensory perception over the left thumb. Paired TMS was delivered with a focal coil on the right posterior parietal lobe after various delays from the presentation of finger stimuli. The effects of different interstimulus intervals (ISI: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 1 1 Bms1B) between the conditioning and the test TMS stimulus on tactile perception were studied. The conditioning stimulus intensity was set at 70 % of motor threshold, while test TMS intensity was 130 % of motor threshold. Single pulse suprathreshold TMS interfered with the perception of finger stimuli, while subthreshold stimuli such as the 'conditioning' stimuli had no effect on sensory perception. Paired TMS differentially influenced the performance depending on the ISI. At an ISI of 1 1 1 Bms1B, paired TMS stimuli induced a significant worsening of the performance compared with single pulse TMS; at an ISI of 5 1 1 Bms1B, paired TMS stimuli induced a significant facilitation of the performance compared with single pulse TMS, restoring baseline performance levels. These results suggest that paired TMS can reveal a selective pattern of ICI and ICF in the human parietal cortex.", "pages": "17-20"}, {"volume": "296", "title": "Diminution of training-induced transient motor cortex plasticity by weak transcranial direct current stimulation in the human.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8624691", "authors": ["Rosenkranz, K", "Nitsche, MA", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Training of a thumb movement in the opposite direction of a twitch in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) induces a transient directional change of post-training TMS-evoked movements towards the trained direction.

We studied the influence of tDCS, applied over the motorcortex during training, on angular deviation of post-training to pre-training TMS-evoked thumb movements. With tDCS of anodal and cathodal polarity the training-induced directional change of thumb movements was significantly reduced during a 10 min post-training interval, indicating an interference of tDCS with mechanisms of rapid training-induced plasticity.", "pages": "17-20"}, {"volume": "181", "title": "Botulinum toxin type-A treatment in spastic paraparesis: a neurophysiological study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "10080378", "authors": ["Pauri, F", "Boffa, L", "Cassetta, E", "Pasqualetti, P", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to verify the action of Botulinum toxin type-A (BoNT-A) by means of neurophysiological techniques, in patients presenting lower limb spasticity and requiring BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles, due to the poor response to medical antispastic treatment.", "pages": "17-20"}, {"volume": "181", "title": "Visual working memory revealed by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "8636468", "authors": ["Hong, KS", "Lee, SK", "Kim, JY", "Kim, KK", "Nam, H"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Patients presenting paraparesis were enrolled.

Visual working memory was significantly disturbed by rTMS over the right hemisphere compared with the left (P<0.05). The disturbance in visual working memory by rTMS was significant over the right inferior frontal (F8), inferior temporal (T8), and middle parietal (P4) areas compared with the control region (P<0.05).

These movements are largely subserved by the 'thenar complex' including the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI), whereas the 'hypothenar complex', innervated by the same myotome, has less ability to fractionate and is relatively spared. This suggests that in ALS, hand dysfunction and wasting is related to corticomotoneuronal representation and input. To determine whether corticomotoneuronal input to the thenar spinal pool is preferentially impaired compared to the hypothenar spinal pool in ALS, we studied 18 ALS patients and 11 normal subjects. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the thenar and hypothenar complexes were evoked by peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. In healthy control subjects the cortical/peripheral (MEP/CMAP) ratios were significantly larger for the thenar complex suggesting a stronger corticomotoneuronal input to this muscle complex (P<0.005). This was not the case in ALS patients. Comparing the ratios between control subjects and patients revealed a significant reduction for the thenar complex (P<0.02) in ALS patients but not for the hypothenar complex. We conclude that corticomotoneuronal input to the thenar complex is preferentially affected in ALS and that corticomotoneuronal disease may be the prime determinant of hand dysfunction and wasting.", "pages": "17-20"}]
