The motor tasks were (a) repetitive opposition movement (thumb tapping the 3rd finger); (b) isolated finger movements in a 'usual' sequence (thumb tapping fingers 2, 3, 4 and 5) and (c) in an 'unusual' sequence (thumb tapping fingers 3, 5, 2 and 4). Subjects were trained before the study up to disappearance of EMG synkinetic activity in the left APB. As compared to the rest condition, MEP amplitude was enhanced in all subjects during paradigm (b) and even more during (c), but remained unchanged during paradigm (a). The MEP increase disappeared in four out of the nine subjects undergoing overtraining. No significant modifications in MEP amplitude were found in the left proximal muscle (biceps, five subjects). The H reflex induced by left median nerve stimulation at the elbow (four subjects) and MEPs from the left APB to transcranial electrical stimulation (three subjects) were not significantly affected by any of the motor paradigms, indicating that the motor cortex was the site of change. These results provide evidence of an increased excitability of cortical motor outputs targeting the unmoving hand muscles during contralateral sequential finger movements which disappears with overtraining. We conclude that during motor learning there is an interhemispheric transfer of information, possibly in order to inhibit the opposite hemisphere from interfering when a fine unimanual movement is required.", "pages": "121-4"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Hypoglossal nerve conduction study by transcranial magnetic stimulation in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "9591886", "authors": ["Muellbacher, W", "Mamoli, B"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery", "abstract": "Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand-associated motor cortex was used to study normal healthy preschool children (n = 7; mean age, 4.6 years) and adults (n = 7; mean age, 29.4 years) under the conditions of standardized tonic voluntary contraction of small hand muscles. Callosally mediated inhibitory as well as corticospinally mediated inhibitory and excitatory motor effects were investigated. Although children had no detectable transcallosal inhibition, their corticospinally mediated postexcitatory silent period was present (mean, 140.8 +/- 30.2 msec). It was significantly shorter than in adults (mean, 192.5 +/- 32.0 msec). The motor thresholds of the cortically elicited muscle responses, measured as the lowest stimulus intensity, were significantly higher in children (mean, 89 +/- 5%) than in adults (mean, 46 +/- 6%). The corticomuscular latency of transcranially elicited motor responses revealed no difference between children and adults. These observations may reflect maturation processes in the motor system. Maturation of at least some direct corticospinal fibers occurs early in life and is followed by that of intracortical excitatory and inhibitory connections. The maturation of functionally competent callosal connections appears to occur after the age of 5 years.", "pages": "121-4"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Absence of transcallosal inhibition following focal magnetic stimulation in preschool children.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7700656", "authors": ["Heinen, F", "Glocker, FX", "Fietzek, U", "Meyer, BU", "L\u00fccking, CH", "Korinthenberg, R"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "The human motor system undergoes reorganization after amputation, but the site of motor reorganization and the mechanisms involved are unknown.

The mechanisms involved were evaluated by measuring the thresholds for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and by testing intracortical inhibition and facilitation. With TMS, the threshold for muscle activation on the amputated side was lower than that of the intact side, but with transcranial electrical stimulation there was no difference in motor threshold between the two sides. TMS at the maximal output of the stimulator activated a higher percentage of the motor neuron pool (%MNP) on the amputated side than on the intact side. The %MNP activated by spinal electrical stimulation was similar on the two sides. Paired TMS study showed significantly less intracortical inhibition on the amputated side.

Peaks in the PSTHs are assumed to coincide with multiple excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced at the motoneurons by corticospinal input.

Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) based on propofol and alfentanil was examined in 17 patients (group A), and balanced anesthesia (BA), based on nitrous oxide, isoflurane and fentanyl, was studied in 13 patients (group B). Distinct motor responses were available in 15 of 17 patients (88%) of group A, and in one of 13 patients (8%) of group B. Amplitudes increased significantly with increasing stimulus intensity and number of pulses under conditions of TIVA. At the same time, latencies decreased significantly with increasing stimulus intensity and decreasing interstimulus interval, but not with increasing number of pulses. It is hypothesized that propofol suppresses corticospinal I-waves at the cortical level, resulting in a conduction block at the level of the alpha-motoneuron, and that this effect may be overcome by high frequency repetitive stimulation. In contrast, nitrous oxide and isoflurane seem to have an additional suppressive effect on corticospinal D-waves, which may be overcome by higher stimulation intensity. In conclusion, transcranial high frequency repetitive stimulation and TIVA provide a feasible setting for intraoperative MEP monitoring, while higher doses of nitrous oxide and isoflurane are not compatible with recording of muscular activity elicited by the stimulation technique as described.", "pages": "121-4"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "Isoflurane plus nitrous oxide versus propofol for recording of motor evoked potentials after high frequency repetitive electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9572234", "authors": ["Pechstein, U", "Nadstawek, J", "Zentner, J", "Schramm, J"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine if cortical motor representation and generators change after partial or complete paralysis after spinal cord injury (SCI).

We recorded and mapped the motor potential (MP) of the movement-related cortical potentials in 12 SCI patients and 11 control subjects. Results were analyzed using a distance metric to compare MP locations between patients and control subjects. EEG was coregistered with subject-specific MR images and a boundary element model created for dipole source analysis (DSA). When compared with normal control subjects, seven quadriparetics had posteriorly located MPs with finger movements. One paraparetic had a posterior MP with toe movements, but three who could not move the toes had normally located MPs on attempts to move. DSA confirmed the electrical field map distributions of the MPs. We are reporting a reorganization of cortical motor activity to a posterior location after SCI.
