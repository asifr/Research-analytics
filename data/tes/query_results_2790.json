The amplitude of MEPs from the FDI and FCR was significantly reduced from 20 to 30 min after the application of capsaicin over the FDI and FCR muscles, respectively, then progressively returned to the basal values. A similar trend of MEPs inhibition was observed for APB and FCR muscles, but this reduction was not significant. Indices of peripheral nerve (M-wave) and spinal cord excitability (F and H waves) did not change throughout the experiments. Motor cortex inhibition induced by tonic cutaneous pain is maximal to muscles adjacent to the painful area. This inhibition may be due to the activation of the C fibres which mediate 'slow' nociception and might be important to alert subject to possible phasic nociceptive events that may occur close to the painful area.", "pages": "97-101"}, {"volume": "314", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Alzheimer disease: motor cortex excitability and cognitive severity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "11698146", "authors": ["Alagona, G", "Bella, R", "Ferri, R", "Carnemolla, A", "Pappalardo, A", "Costanzo, E", "Pennisi, G"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "To study the possible changes of cortical excitability in the Alzheimer disease (AD) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and to evaluate their eventual correlation with its stage twenty-one AD patients and 18 normal controls underwent TMS.

The motor threshold in AD patients was lower than in normal subjects with a significant correlation between the stage of cognitive severity. The amplitude of MEPs was increased and the SP duration was reduced in AD patients. No significant differences were obtained for CMCT.

Second, stimulating a membrane-simulating circuit, we found that, for a particular coil orientation, these two stimulators resulted in a peak induced current of the same polarity but in a peak induced charge accumulation of opposite polarity. We suggest that the critical parameter in TMS is the amplitude of the induced charge accumulation rather than the amplitude of the induced current. Accordingly, TMS would be elicited just before the end of the first (Magstim 200) and second (Magstim Super Rapid) phase of the induced current rather than just after the start of the first phase of the induced current.", "pages": "97-101"}, {"volume": "141", "title": "Effect of apomorphine on cortical inhibition in Parkinson's disease patients: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11685410", "authors": ["Pierantozzi, M", "Palmieri, MG", "Marciani, MG", "Bernardi, G", "Giacomini, P", "Stanzione, P"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS were studied at rest by utilising distinct paired-pulse TMS protocols. Out of 29 untreated PD patients and 29 healthy subjects, early cortical inhibition (1-6 ms) was studied in a first subgroup of 17 PD patients and 15 healthy subjects, whereas late cortical inhibition (20-200 ms) was studied in a second subgroup of 21 PD patients and 19 healthy subjects. In all PD patients the same TMS protocols were performed before and after 3 h of apomorphine infusion. In comparison to healthy subjects, untreated PD patients showed a significant reduction of both early and late cortical inhibition, which was maximal at 2-3 ms, and at 80-100 ms, respectively. Apomorphine administration consistently reversed all the MEP abnormalities found in PD patients. The lack of TMS effects on the Hoffman's reflex (HR), at those intervals revealing the reduced inhibition in PD patients, is compatible with a supraspinal origin of the observed MEP abnormalities. Our data suggest that the cortical and/or subcortical loss of dopaminergic transmission in PD patients is associated with impaired motor cortical inhibitory mechanisms, as tested by a decreased early and late MEP inhibition.", "pages": "97-101"}, {"volume": "140", "title": "Motor cortex excitability following short trains of repetitive magnetic stimuli.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11685398", "authors": ["Modugno, N", "Nakamura, Y", "MacKinnon, CD", "Filipovic, SR", "Bestmann, S", "Berardelli, A", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In order to investigate the mechanism of this effect in more detail we applied short periods of rTMS consisting of up to 20 stimuli at 5 Hz, 10 Hz or 20 Hz (rTMS) to the motor cortex at an intensity equal to resting threshold in 11 healthy, relaxed subjects. Spinal excitability, as judged by effects on the H-reflex or on transcranial anodal facilitation of the H-reflex, was not affected by the rTMS. However, cortical excitability, as judged by the effect on the size of EMG responses evoked by a suprathreshold TMS pulse, was decreased for up to 1 s after the end of rTMS. Post-train suppression was more powerful following longer trains or higher frequencies of rTMS. The predominant suppression contrasts with previous reports of facilitation, particularly after high-frequency rTMS. A second set of experiments, however, showed that this could be converted into facilitation if the intensity of rTMS was increased. We conclude that the after-effects of rTMS depend on its frequency, intensity and duration. The results are consistent with a model in which inhibition and facilitation build up gradually during the course of a conditioning train. Inhibition reaches its maximum effect after only a small number of stimuli, whereas facilitation takes longer. The threshold for evoking inhibition is lower than that for facilitation. Thus if moderate intensities of conditioning train are applied, inhibition is predominant after short trains, whereas facilitation dominates after long trains.", "pages": "97-101"}, {"volume": "140", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation differentially affects speed and direction judgments.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11685392", "authors": ["Matthews, N", "Luber, B", "Qian, N", "Lisanby, SH"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Subjects viewed two successively presented moving stimuli that differed from each other both in speed and direction of motion. Single-pulse TMS was applied either medially (approximately 2 cm above the inion) or laterally (approximately 5 cm lateral to and 4 cm above the inion), while subjects judged the speed and direction differences. The physical stimulation (visual and TMS) was identical on the two tasks, as was discriminability (d') when TMS was not applied. We found significant criterion (beta) shifts on the speed discrimination task at both stimulation sites. Specifically, on TMS trials the proportion of \"slower\" judgments increased significantly, consistent with subjective reports that stimuli often appeared to slow when TMS was applied. The subjective reports indicated no corresponding change in perceived direction. We also found that speed discriminability was impaired significantly more than direction discriminability, but only when TMS was applied medially. Indeed, after controlling for TMS-related changes in reaction time, speed discriminability was impaired significantly, while direction discriminability remained largely intact. This dissociation suggests that the sensory response constraining speed discrimination is at least partially independent from the sensory response constraining direction discrimination. Combined with previous psychophysical data, the present data suggest a double dissociation between speed and direction discrimination in humans.", "pages": "97-101"}, {"volume": "140", "title": "Further insight into the task-dependent excitability of motor evoked potentials in first dorsal interosseous muscle in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11685391", "authors": ["Hasegawa, Y", "Kasai, T", "Tsuji, T", "Yahagi, S"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In the first step of the experiment, based on previous findings, we investigated remarkable functional differences between intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles during complex finger tasks (precision and power grip). During the performance of the tasks, the optimal stimulus intensity of the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the contralateral motor cortex. MEPs of the FDI, extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles were recorded simultaneously with increased background EMG activity step by step in both tasks. The intensity threshold of TMS was lower in the precision grip. Furthermore, the MEP amplitudes of FDI muscle dependent on the background EMG activity were different between these two tasks, i.e., MEP amplitudes and regression coefficients in a precision grip were larger than those in a power grip. Although our results for MEP amplitude and threshold in the FDI muscle were similar to previous reported evidence, the different contributions of a synergistic muscle (in particular, the ECR muscle) during performance in these tasks was new evidence. Since there were no differences in cutaneous afferent effects on both tasks, corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells connected to FDI motoneurons seemed generally to be more active during precision than power gripping, and there were different contributions from synergistic muscles during the performance of these tasks. In the second part of the experiment, the results obtained from the complex tasks were compared with those from a simple task (isolated index finger flexion). MEP amplitudes, dependent on the background EMG activity during isolated index finger flexion, varied among subjects, i.e., the relationship between the MEP amplitude and the background EMG of the FDI muscle showed individual, strategy-dependent modulation. There were several kinds of individual motor strategies for performing the isolated finger movement. The present results may explain the previous contradictory evidence related to the contribution of the CM system during coordinated finger movement.", "pages": "97-101"}, {"volume": "313", "title": "Age-related decrease in paired-pulse intracortical inhibition in the human primary motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "11684333", "authors": ["Peinemann, A", "Lehner, C", "Conrad, B", "Siebner, HR"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Using biphasic magnetic stimuli, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) was employed to investigate age-related changes in the balance between intracortical inhibition and facilitation.
