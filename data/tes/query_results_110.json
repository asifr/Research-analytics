One of these approaches is brain stimulation, which involves either the direct application of electrical current to structures in the nervous system or the indirect application of current by means of electromagnetic induction. Interventions that manipulate the brain have generally been regarded as having both the potential to alleviate devastating brain-related conditions and the capacity to create unforeseen and unwanted consequences. Hence, although brain stimulation techniques offer considerable benefits to society, they also raise a number of ethical concerns. In this paper we will address various dilemmas related to brain stimulation in the context of clinical practice and biomedical research. We will survey current work involving deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. We will reflect upon relevant similarities and differences between them, and consider some potentially problematic issues that may arise within the framework of established principles of medical ethics: nonmaleficence and beneficence, autonomy, and justice.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "The challenge of crafting policy for do-it-yourself brain stimulation.", "keywords": ["V2", "brightness", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "primary visual cortex", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "23733050", "authors": ["Fitz, NS", "Reiner, PB"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of medical ethics", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a simple means of brain stimulation, possesses a trifecta of appealing features: it is relatively safe, relatively inexpensive and relatively effective.

Many TMS applications call for large electric fields to be sharply focused on regions that often lie deep inside the brain. Unfortunately, the fields generated by present-day TMS coils diffuse and decay rapidly as they penetrate into the head. As a result, they tend to stimulate relatively large regions of tissue near the brain surface. Earlier studies suggested that a focused TMS excitation can be attained using multiple nonuniformly fed coils in a multichannel array. We propose a systematic, genetic algorithm-based technique for synthesizing multichannel arrays that minimize the volume of the excited region required to achieve a prescribed penetration depth and maintain realistic values for the input driving currents. Because multichannel arrays are costly to build, we also propose a method to convert the multichannel arrays into single-channel ones while minimally materially deteriorating performance. Numerical results show that the new multi- and single-channel arrays stimulate tissue 2.4\u00a0cm into the head while exciting 3.0 and 2.6\u00a0times less volume than conventional Figure-8 coils, respectively.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Effects of water immersion on short- and long-latency afferent inhibition, short-interval intracortical inhibition, and intracortical facilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "23688919", "authors": ["Sato, D", "Yamashiro, K", "Yoshida, T", "Onishi, H", "Shimoyama, Y", "Maruyama, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "A valid sham control is important for determining the efficacy and effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as an experimental and clinical tool. Given the manner in which rTMS is applied, separately or in combination with self-regulatory approaches, and its intended impact on brain states, a valid sham control of this type may well serve as a meaningful control for biofeedback studies, where efforts to develop a credible control have often been less than ideal. This study examined the effectiveness of focal electrical stimulation of the frontalis muscle as a sham technique for blinding participants to high-frequency rTMS over the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at durations, intensities, and schedules of stimulation similar to many clinical applications. In this within-subjects single blind design, 19 participants made guesses immediately after receiving 54 counterbalanced rTMS sessions (sham, 10 Hz, 20 Hz); 7 (13 %) of the guesses were made for sham, 31 (57 %) were made for 10 Hz, and 16 (30 %) were made for 20 Hz. Participants correctly guessed the sham condition 6 % (CI 1, 32 %) of the time, which is less than the odds of chance (i.e., of guessing at random, 33 %); correctly guessed the 10 Hz condition 66 % (CI 43, 84 %) of the time, which was greater than chance; and correctly guessed the 20 Hz condition 41 % (CI 21, 65 %) of the time, which was no different than chance. Focal electrical stimulation therefore can be an effective sham control for high-frequency rTMS of the DLPFC, as well as for active biofeedback interventions.

While there is support for the view that the stimulation of several different visual areas in the occipital lobe may produce phosphenes, it is not clear what the contribution of each area is. Here, we studied the roles of the primary visual cortex (V1) and the adjacent area V2 in eliciting phosphenes by using functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with spherical modeling of the TMS-induced electric field. Reports of the subjective visual features of phosphenes were systematically collected and analyzed. We found that selective stimulation of V1 and V2 are equally capable of generating phosphenes, as demonstrated by comparable phosphene thresholds and similar characteristics of phosphene shape, color, and texture. However, the phosphenes induced by V1 stimulation were systematically perceived as brighter than the phosphenes induced by the stimulation of V2. Thus, these results suggest that V1 and V2 have a similar capability to produce conscious percepts. Nevertheless, V1 and V2 contribute differently to brightness: neural activation originating in V1 generates a more intense sensation of brightness than similar activation originating in V2.", "pages": ""}]
