Hemiplegic attacks had occurred consistently at a frequency of a few per week since infancy, and he first experienced attacks of cerebellar ataxia at the age of 23 years. Intellectual impairment, dysarthria, dystonic posturing, and a wide-based gait had been slowly progressive, but they had been stable since he turned twenty. The electromyographic response to transcranial magnetic stimulation was normal between attacks and showed reversible alteration during an attack. MRI revealed slight dilatation of the lateral ventricles, and MR angiography showed normal cerebral blood flow. Proton MR spectroscopy between attacks showed normal peak area ratios for N-acetyl groups, choline-containing compounds, and creatine and phosphocreatine, and it also demonstrated no lactic peak. 123I-IMP SPECT between attacks demonstrated diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion despite no evidence of ischemic change in the above MR study. These results suggest that the slowly progressive neurological deficits are due to the primary underlying pathology rather than the secondary neuronal loss as a result of frequent ischemic attacks.", "pages": "217-21"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Magnetic stimulation of motor cortex in children: maturity of corticospinal pathway and problem of clinical application.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9134188", "authors": ["Nezu, A", "Kimura, S", "Uehara, S", "Kobayashi, T", "Tanaka, M", "Saito, K"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Brain & development", "abstract": "The developmental profile of the electromyographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was studied in 46 neurologically normal children aged from one to 14 years, compared with data in 10 normal control adults. To obtain motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the first dorsal interosseous muscle in the resting state, the motor cortex was stimulated through a circular coil with the stimulus intensity set at 10% above the threshold intensity for eliciting MEPs. Reproducible MEPs were obtained in all but the children aged below 2 years, and the threshold intensity and central motor conduction time (CMCT) showed a linear decrease with maturation. The MEP amplitude changed little until 9 years of age, but it tended to increase between 10 years and adulthood. The MEP duration, which was not influenced by age, was less than 16 ms over the ages studied. The present data suggest that maturity of the corticospinal motor pathway that controls the intrinsic hand muscles is electrophysiologically complete at 13 years of age. Among the parameters of MEPs, CMCT and MEP duration may be useful for evaluating impairment of the corticospinal tracts in children aged 2 years and older.", "pages": "217-21"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Cortical mechanisms mediating the inhibitory period after magnetic stimulation of the facial motor area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "9121498", "authors": ["Cruccu, G", "Inghilleri, M", "Berardelli, A", "Romaniello, A", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "We studied the silent period (SP) that interrupts voluntary electromyographic activity (EMG) in facial muscles, after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in normal subjects. High-intensity magnetic stimulation with a 12-cm round coil centered at the vertex induced a long-lasting SP (215 ms), whereas supramaximal stimulation of the facial nerve only induced a short (< 20 ms) and incomplete EMG suppression, and cutaneous stimuli had no inhibitory effect at all. Cutaneous trigeminal stimulation delivered after TMS evoked blink-like reflexes, showing that facial motoneurons were not inhibited during the SP. Simultaneous recordings from perioral muscles (large cortical representation) and from orbicularis oculi and masseter muscles (small cortical representation) showed SPs of identical duration. Focal stimuli with a figure-of-eight coil showed that positioning of the coil was critical and that the optimal scalp sites for evoking the largest motor potentials and longest SPs coincided. Low-intensity stimulation occasionally elicited short SPs without a preceding motor potential. We conclude that the SP induced in facial muscles by TMS results from the excitation of cortical inhibitory interneurons surrounding the upper motoneurons.", "pages": "217-21"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "Central pathway of photic reflex myoclonus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "9533797", "authors": ["Kanouchi, T", "Yokota, T", "Kamata, T", "Ishii, K", "Senda, M"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Direct, new evidence for the cortical origin of photic reflex myoclonus in a patient with \"posterior cortical atrophy\" is provided.

The primary CNS action of ketamine appears to be a non-competitive block of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Although numerous other receptors (e.g., GABA, nicotinic acetylcholine, opiate, voltage-operated channels) have been reported to interact with ketamine, their role in inducing dissociative anaesthesia is still under discussion. In humans, characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after administration of ketamine are dose-dependent increases in delta, theta, and beta power. In equipotent doses S-(+)-ketamine induces similar EEG changes. However, in comparison to racemic ketamine and S-(+)-ketamine, R-(-)-ketamine does not suppress the EEG to the same extent. Former studies suggested that ketamine is a proconvulsive agent; however, recent studies have demonstrated anticonvulsive and even neuroprotective properties. In humans, low-dose ketamine has no influence on early cortical peaks of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). Larger doses induce increases in SEP amplitude while latencies are unchanged. Recent data indicate that analgesia induced by low-dose ketamine may be quantitated by specific pain-related SEP. Significant reductions of pain-induced cortical potentials may be correlated with subjective pain ratings. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (AEP) are not influenced by ketamine. Interestingly, in contrast to many other anaesthetics, middle-latency AEP were not altered by racemic and S-(+)-ketamine. This observation may indicate insufficient suppression of auditory stimulus processing during ketamine anaesthesia. Motor evoked responses to transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation in humans are not markedly suppressed by ketamine.", "pages": "217-21"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Cortico-bulbar fibers to orofacial muscles: recordings with enoral surface electrodes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "13052067", "authors": ["Urban, PP", "Beer, S", "Hopf, HC"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "A new recording technique was developed to eliminate current problems on recording transcranial evoked facial muscle responses.

In the 24 acute patients, the recordings were made at the 7th day on the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. We studied the amplitudes of the motor evoked potential (MEP) responses and the post-MEP silent period durations (SPD) at different levels of stimulation intensity (SI) and voluntary isometric contraction (VIC). The evolution of these parameters was matched to the clinical status of the 24 acute patients evaluated 7, 30 and 90 days after the stroke (D7, D30 and D90). Our results may be summarised as follows: (1) in all cases, the MEP-amplitudes increased with facilitation and SI; (2) in the normal subjects and in patients who did recover, the SPD augmented with stronger SI but was found to be independent on the strength of voluntary contraction; (3) in the acute patients with poor recovery, as well as in the chronic patients with spasticity, the SPD decreased with stronger VIC. It may be concluded that MEP-amplitudes and SPD patterns point out excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms which may be differently affected in cerebral injuries. The association between shortening of the SPD with increasing VIC of the target muscle and poor recovery of the stroke after 3 months could be a useful clinical test to predict eventual recovery early after a stroke.", "pages": "217-21"}]
