During the 1st week post-injury and post-surgical treatment, all subjects were submitted to electromyogram (EMG) recordings, dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (D.SEP), posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (PTN.SEP), MEP and bilateral cervical electrical stimulations with recording of the diaphragm. For the D.SEP, the latencies of the N9 and N20 responses and the conduction time (N9-N20) were measured in the upper limbs; the latencies of the P40 and P60 responses were measured in the lower limbs. MEP were recorded from distal upper and lower limb muscles following transcranial electrical stimulation of the cortex. (Magnetic stimulation was not indicated because of implanted metallic material in the cervical skull of many patients.) A SEP and MEP grading system was used to improve the assessment of different root neurological levels. In patients with incomplete lesions PTN.SEP, D.SEP and MEP responses could be recorded in territories that were clinically deficient. Patients with complete lesions and absent SEP and MEP responses had a poor outcome. A good correlation was found between the severity of the spinal cord injury and SEP grading. For MEP, the presence or absence of intercostal responses (C4) to cervical and cortical stimulation was the best prognostic indicator. The combined electrophysiological exploration of MEP and SEP proved to be a useful tool for monitoring patients with severe spinal cord injury.", "pages": "39-55"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "A multifunctional helmet for noninvasive neuromonitoring.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9559771", "authors": ["Litscher, G"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology", "abstract": "Simultaneous and continuous recording and processing of different noninvasive neuromonitoring parameters were carried out, including spontaneous and evoked bioelectrical brain activities obtained by new \"active electrodes,\" transcranial Doppler sonographic measurements using robotic probes, a multiscan principle for three-dimensional transcranial Doppler imaging, and recording of near-infrared spectroscopic data.

For this purpose, magnetic stimuli were applied using a figure-of-eight shaped magnetic coil and a Magstim 200 stimulator at an intensity of 15% above motor threshold for the deltoid muscle. There was a considerable overlap between the cortical areas from which motor responses of the two muscles could be evoked with the FDI represented more laterally than the deltoid muscle. The cortical location from which maximal amplitudes of motor evoked potentials were elicited was 4-8 cm lateral of Cz with the FDI and 2-6 cm lateral of Cz with the deltoid muscle. Calculated centres of cortical points with maximal muscle responses were significantly separated with the FDI represented 5.7 cm lateral of Cz and deltoid muscle 4.3 cm lateral of Cz. The anterior-posterior extension of the cortical maps did not show significant differences between the proximal and distal arm muscle.

Clinical studies mainly address slowing of conduction through measurement of increased central conduction time (CCT) and 'failures' of conduction through observation of marked reductions in the size of the motor evoked potential (MEP). While CCT is of great interest in detecting subclinical slowing of conduction, the method discloses only gross failures of conduction, since the size of the MEP varies markedly between normal subjects and from one stimulus to another, leading to a broad range of normal values. Furthermore, transcranial stimulation does not appear to achieve depolarization of all spinal motor neurons leading to the target muscles, since in most normal subjects MEPs are smaller in amplitude than the responses evoked by peripheral nerve stimulation. We have developed a triple stimulation technique (TST) which, through two collisions, links central to peripheral conduction and suppresses desynchronization of MEPs. This technique shows that transcranial stimulation does achieve depolarization of all, or nearly all, spinal motor neurons supplying the target muscle in healthy subjects. Our data thus demonstrate that the amplitudes of MEPs are (i) smaller than those of peripheral responses, mostly due to phase cancellation of the action potentials caused by the desynchronization occurring within the corticospinal tract or at spinal cell level and (ii) variable between normal subjects and from one stimulus to another, mostly due to variability of this desynchronization. This technique provides new insights into normal corticospinal tract conduction. It will improve detection and quantification of central motor conduction failures.", "pages": "39-55"}, {"volume": "121 ( Pt 2)", "title": "Electrical stimulation over muscle tendons in humans.

This phenomenon has been attributed to the activation of a polysynaptic inhibitory pathway originating from Ib afferent fibres. To clarify its origin we conducted several experiments in 10 normal healthy subjects. The EMG silence after tendon stimulation appeared at relatively high stimulus intensities (> 50 mA); conditioning cutaneous stimulation left it unchanged, and the inhibition had a short recovery cycle (50 ms). Tendon stimulation still evoked EMG suppression during an ischaemic block of fast-conducting afferents. The motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex during the EMG silence remained almost unchanged, whereas the H reflex was strongly inhibited. Hence we conclude that tendon stimulation activates slow-conducting tendon afferents, possibly group III fibres, connected not through a polysynaptic pathway originating from Ib afferents but through an oligo- or disynaptic inhibitory circuit. The EMG suppression after tendon stimulation probably represents a dysfacilitation of the alpha-motor neurons due to presynaptic inhibition of Ia fibres produced by tendon afferent input to the spinal cord.", "pages": "39-55"}, {"volume": "79", "title": "Rapid plasticity of human cortical movement representation induced by practice.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9549512", "authors": ["Classen, J", "Liepert, J", "Wise, SP", "Hallett, M", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The process of acquiring motor skills through the sustained performance of complex movements is associated with neural plasticity. However, it is unknown whether even simple movements, repeated over a short period of time, are effective in inducing cortical representational changes. Whether the motor cortex can retain specific kinematic aspects of a recently practiced movement is also unknown. We used focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex to evoke isolated and directionally consistent thumb movements. Thumb movements then were practiced in a different direction. Subsequently, TMS came to evoke movements in or near the recently practiced direction for several minutes before returning to the original direction. To initiate a change of the TMS-evoked movement direction, 15 or 30 min of continuous training were required in most of the subjects and, on two occasions, as little as 5 or 10 min. Substantially smaller effects followed more direct stimulation of corticofugal axons with transcranial electrical stimulation, pointing to cortex as the site of plasticity. These findings suggest that the training rapidly, and transiently, established a change in the cortical network representing the thumb, which encoded kinematic details of the practiced movement. This phenomenon may be regarded as a short-term memory for movement and be the first step of skill acquisition.", "pages": "39-55"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Magnetic transcranial stimulation at intensities below active motor threshold activates intracortical inhibitory circuits.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9463469", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Restuccia, D", "Oliviero, A", "Profice, P", "Ferrara, L", "Insola, A", "Mazzone, P", "Tonali, P", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In order to define the mechanism of this inhibitory effect, we recorded descending volleys produced by single and paired magnetic transcranial stimulation of motor cortex through high cervical, epidural electrodes implanted for pain relief in two conscious subjects with no abnormality of the central nervous system. The conditioning stimulus evoked no recognisable descending activity in the spinal cord, whilst the test stimulus evoked 3-4 waves of activity (I-waves). Conditioning stimulation suppressed the size of both the descending spinal cord volleys and the EMG responses evoked by the test stimulus. Inhibition of the descending spinal volleys was most pronounced at ISI 1 ms and had disappeared by ISI 5 ms. It was evident for all components following the I1-wave, while the I1-wave itself was not inhibited at all.
