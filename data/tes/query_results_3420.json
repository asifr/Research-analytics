In normal subjects and patients with facial palsy, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of the orbicularis oris muscle elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were compared with CMAPs elicited by electrical stimulation at a peripheral site of the stylomastoid foramen. This technique is similar to electroneurography (ENoG) and is regularly used in our department. In normal subjects, the latency of magnetically evoked CMAPs was longer (1.0ms, SD 0.39ms) than that of CMAPs evoked by electrical stimulation. There were two categories of patients; the first group consisted of patients who visited our hospital within 2 weeks after palsy onset with a record of electrically evoked CMAPs (ENoG) and magnetically evoked CMAPs, the second group consisted of all others. The first group was then divided into four subgroups based on minimal ENoG values obtained within 2 weeks after the onset of palsy. In patients, ENoG values declined until the seventh day after palsy onset, and then plateaued. However, the amplitude ratio of magnetically evoked CMAPs between the affected side and normal side showed no tendency to deline until the seventh day after palsy onset. Thus, whether magnetically evoked CMAPs could be recorded must be discussed in relation to the prognosis of facial palsy. The patients in whom magnetically evoked CMAPs could be recorded within the seven days after the onset of palsy were classified into a group in which the minimal ENoG value was greater than 20%. These patients recovered almost 2 months after the onset of palsy, and were significantly better than the recovery rates of those patients in whom magnetically evoked CMAPs could not be recorded. The site at which the facial nerve is magnetically stimulated remains controversial. In patients with peripheral facial palsy, recovery of the stapedial reflex, blink reflex and magnetically evoked CMAPs were examined to investigate the site of magnetic stimulation. From the clinical perspective, the facial nerve is thought to be magnetically stimulated near the meatal foramen that Fisch reported the site of damage in Bell's palsy. This stimulation site was almost the same point as that calculated from the mean latency difference between magnetically evoked CMAPs and ENoG in normal controls.", "pages": "1416-25"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Corticospinal control during reach, grasp, and precision lift in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "7666197", "authors": ["Lemon, RN", "Johansson, RS", "Westling, G"], "year": "1995", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (TMS) was used to assess the influence of the corticospinal system on motor output in seven human subjects during a task in which they had to reach out, grasp, and lift an object. Stimuli, directed at the hand area of the motor cortex, were delivered at eight defined points during the task: during reach, at grip closure, during object manipulation, during the parallel isometric increase in grip and load forces, during the lifting movement, and while the object was held in air. The amplitudes of short-latency EMG responses evoked by TMS in six arm and hand muscles showed a striking modulation across the different phases of the task. This modulation may well reflect phasic changes in corticospinal excitability because: (1) it did not simply reflect phasic changes in muscular activity associated with task performance, (2) it could vary inversely with the amplitude of the background EMG, and (3) it was only obtained with weak TMS intensities, below threshold for evoking responses in hand muscles of the relaxed subject. Our results suggest that the cortical representations of extrinsic hand muscles, which act to orientate the hand and finger tips, were subjected to a strong excitatory drive throughout the reach. This drive was also observed for brachioradialis and anterior deltoid, which contribute to transport of the hand. In contrast, the intrinsic hand muscles appear to receive their strongest cortical input as the digits closed around the object, and just after the subject first touched the object at the onset of manipulation. The isometric parallel increase in load and grip forces necessary to lift the object, which is normally triggered by tactile contact, was delayed by TMS delivered late during the reach. TMS at this time may disrupt processing necessary to control this critical phase of the task.", "pages": "1416-25"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in multiple system and late onset cerebellar atrophies.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "7484075", "authors": ["Cruz Mart\u00ednez, A", "Arpa, J", "Alonso, M", "Palomo, F", "Villoslada, C"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "abstract": "Central motor conduction time (CMCT) after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the cortex, electromyography and nerve conduction velocity were performed in 24 patients with multiple system (MSA) and late onset cerebellar atrophy (LOCA) (often olivopontocerebellar atrophy--OPCA -). CMCT was abnormal in 7 patients with OPCA and one with LOCA. CMCT abnormalities (43% of cases) and increased threshold (68%) were more often found within OPCA group than in another multisystem atrophy and LOCA. Reduction in amplitude of the response after TMS was significantly correlated with cerebral hemispheres's atrophy. Increased threshold was correlated with upper vermal hemisphere atrophy and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. Electrophysiologic signs of mixed peripheral neuropathy were found in 8 patients. TMS abnormalities were not related to peripheral nerve involvement. Marked variation in CMCT suggests heterogeneity in these diseases. However, the percentage of CMCT abnormalities in OPCA group suggests that TMS seems to play a role in the neurophysiological diagnosis of these heterogeneous disorders.", "pages": "1416-25"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "[Excitability of motor cortex with transcranial magnetic double stimulation in the intact man].", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "7474462", "authors": ["Yoshino, A", "Yokota, T"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Rinsho byori.

In addition, H-reflex of the forearm muscle was used to study the effect of the magnetic cortical conditioning stimulus on alpha-motoneuron, and the test response evoked by electrical cortical stimulation was also used to examine the effect of the magnetic cortical conditioning stimulus. The subthreshold conditioning and suprathreshold test stimuli were applied, and compound muscle responses were recorded in the relaxed abductor pollicis brevis muscle. There was a decrease of the test response size by the conditioning stimulus at C-T interval of 1-5ms. This attenuation was probably caused by intracortical inhibition. Because the identical magnetic cortical conditioning stimulus produced increase in H-reflex size. Moreover, the test response evoked by electrical cortical stimulus was not suppressed by the magnetic cortical conditioning stimulus; whereas, response evoked by the magnetic cortical test stimulus was suppressed at C-T intervals of 2ms. With the technique of transcranial magnetic double stimulation, therefore, it is possible to evaluate the inhibitory function in the motor cortex.

It has been suggested that one factor contributing to neglect contralateral to a unilateral parietal lesion is a release of the normal hemisphere from reciprocal interhemispheric inhibition by the damaged hemisphere. Consistent with this account, the current study demonstrated that transcranial magnetic stimulation over the parietal cortex results in increased sensitivity to cutaneous stimulation ipsilateral to the stimulation. The likely mechanism is a transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced transient dysfunction of the ipsilateral parietal cortex that then results in disinhibition of the contralateral parietal cortex.", "pages": "1416-25"}, {"volume": "83", "title": "Improved amplitude of myogenic motor evoked responses after paired transcranial electrical stimulation during sufentanil/nitrous oxide anesthesia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "7631948", "authors": ["Kalkman, CJ", "Ubags, LH", "Been, HD", "Swaan, A", "Drummond, JC"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Anesthesiology", "abstract": "Measurement of motor evoked responses to transcranial stimulation (tc-MER) is a technique for intraoperative monitoring of motor pathways in the brain and spinal cord.

Eleven patients whose neurologic condition was normal and who were undergoing spinal or aortic surgery were anesthetized with sufentanil-N20-ketamine. Partial neuromuscular blockade (single-twitch height 25% of baseline) was maintained with vecuronium.

While the MEP is thought to arise from stimulation of the corticospinal tract, the origin of the SLR is uncertain. In the present study we have investigated the properties of the SLR in order to elucidate its origin. An SLR was evoked at a latency of 100-120 msec in 5 out of 10 normal subjects in the relaxed state and at a latency of approximately 100 msec in all subjects when tibialis anterior (TA) was slightly facilitated. The SLR was largest with 5-10% TA contraction, decreased in size with increasing levels of TA contraction and was negligible in all subjects when the foot was immobilised. The latency of the SLR fell by 23 msec when the foot was passively dorsiflexed 20 degrees. A similar response to the SLR, at a latency of 77 msec, was present in all subjects following electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve. Our findings suggest that the SLR is a soleus stretch reflex resulting from dorsiflexion of the foot due to preferential activation of TA following cortical stimulation.", "pages": "1416-25"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Nitrous oxide increases cerebral blood flow velocity during pharmacologically induced EEG silence in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "7772973", "authors": ["Matta, BF", "Lam, AM"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology", "abstract": "We studied responses from the masseter and nasalis muscles following magnetic stimulation (magStim) and compared these responses with those obtained by direct electrical stimulation of the trigeminal (NV) and facial (NVII) nerve near the root exit zone during microvascular decompression operations of NVII.
