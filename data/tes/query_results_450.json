The cerebellum facilitates these functions using sensory feedback. We investigated whether cerebellar processing of sensory afferent information influences the plasticity of the primary motor cortex (M1). Theta-burst stimulation protocols (TBS), both excitatory and inhibitory, were used to modulate the excitability of the posterior cerebellar cortex and to condition an ongoing M1 plasticity. M1 plasticity was subsequently induced in 2 different ways: by paired associative stimulation (PAS) involving sensory processing and TBS that exclusively involves intracortical circuits of M1. Cerebellar excitation attenuated the PAS-induced M1 plasticity, whereas cerebellar inhibition enhanced and prolonged it. Furthermore, cerebellar inhibition abolished the topography-specific response of PAS-induced M1 plasticity, with the effects spreading to adjacent motor maps. Conversely, cerebellar excitation had no effect on the TBS-induced M1 plasticity. This demonstrates the key role of the cerebellum in priming M1 plasticity, and we propose that it is likely to occur at the thalamic or olivo-dentate nuclear level by influencing the sensory processing. We suggest that such a cerebellar priming of M1 plasticity could shape the impending motor command by favoring or inhibiting the recruitment of several muscle representations.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "A practical guide to diagnostic transcranial magnetic stimulation: report of an IFCN committee.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "22349304", "authors": ["Groppa, S", "Oliviero, A", "Eisen, A", "Quartarone, A", "Cohen, LG", "Mall, V", "Kaelin-Lang, A", "Mima, T", "Rossi, S", "Thickbroom, GW", "Rossini, PM", "Ziemann, U", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Siebner, HR"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an established neurophysiological tool to examine the integrity of the fast-conducting corticomotor pathways in a wide range of diseases associated with motor dysfunction.

We then lay out the general principles that apply to a standardized clinical examination of the fast-conducting corticomotor pathways with single-pulse TMS.

Although this view has gained much support from behavioural and electrophysiological studies, the hypothesis that extinction causes the partial erasure of fear memories remains viable. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we investigated how neural circuits are modified by fear learning and extinction by examining the formation and elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer-V pyramidal neurons in the mouse frontal association cortex. Here we show that fear conditioning by pairing an auditory cue with a footshock increases the rate of spine elimination. By contrast, fear extinction by repeated presentation of the same auditory cue without a footshock increases the rate of spine formation. The degrees of spine remodelling induced by fear conditioning and extinction strongly correlate with the expression and extinction of conditioned fear responses, respectively. Notably, spine elimination and formation induced by fear conditioning and extinction occur on the same dendritic branches in a cue- and location-specific manner: cue-specific extinction causes formation of dendritic spines within a distance of two micrometres from spines that were eliminated after fear conditioning. Furthermore, reconditioning preferentially induces elimination of dendritic spines that were formed after extinction. Thus, within vastly complex neuronal networks, fear conditioning, extinction and reconditioning lead to opposing changes at the level of individual synapses. These findings also suggest that fear memory traces are partially erased after extinction.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on pain perception and working memory.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "22343895", "authors": ["Mylius, V", "Jung, M", "Menzler, K", "Haag, A", "Khader, PH", "Oertel, WH", "Rosenow, F", "Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "European journal of pain (London, England)", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that non-invasive stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could modulate experimentally induced pain and working memory (WM) in healthy subjects. However, the two aspects have never been assessed concomitantly. The present study was set up to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the DLPFC on thermal pain and WM in the same population of healthy volunteers. In a randomized and balanced order of different sessions separated by 1 week, 20 min of 2 mA anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS were applied to the left or right DLPFC in two separate experiments. Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled for each stimulated hemisphere. Warm and cold detection thresholds, heat and cold pain thresholds as well as heat pain tolerance thresholds were measured before, during and following tDCS. WM was assessed by a 2-back task applied once during cortical stimulation. Anodal tDCS of the right DLPFC led to an increase of tolerance to heat pain. The 2-back task revealed fewer outliers during cathodal tDCS of the left DLPFC. The present data show an involvement of the DLPFC in the processing of pain and WM. There was no correlation between these findings, suggesting that the analgesic effects of cortical stimulation are not associated with cognitive processing. However, this conclusion is difficult to affirm because of some limitations of the study regarding the parameters of stimulation or a ceiling effect of the 2-back task for instance.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "1446", "title": "Electromyographic bursting following the cortical silent period induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22337597", "authors": ["Chin, O", "Cash, RF", "Thickbroom, GW"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "In subjects performing voluntary background contraction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) induces an interruption of electromyographic (EMG) activity known as the silent period (SP). This is thought to be mediated through the action of inhibitory cortical neurons, in particular involving \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptors. In some studies of the SP, a post-SP increase in EMG activity has been reported but not described in detail. In the present study we have sought to determine the presence and persistence of late EMG bursting associated with the return of voluntary drive after the SP, and to characterize the relationship to background contraction level, stimulus intensity, and SP duration. TMS was delivered at 3 levels of intensity (120, 140 and 160% of active motor threshold) and during 3 levels of voluntary contraction of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (10, 30 and 50% of maximum contraction) in a pseudo-randomized order in 11 healthy participants. The SP was followed by a brief (~60 ms) burst of EMG up to 290\u00b142% of the pre-stimulus EMG level. Both SP duration and the amplitude of the EMG burst increased with TMS intensity (p<0.001). Burst amplitude correlated with SP duration (r2=0.750; p=0.003). We conclude that post-SP EMG bursting is a quantifiable phenomenon that depends on the strength of TMS and the duration of the SP. This bursting may correspond with the post inhibitory period of disinhibition that has recently been identified in human motor cortex.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "512", "title": "Enhancement of selective attention by tDCS: interaction with interference in a Sternberg task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "22330727", "authors": ["Gladwin, TE", "den Uyl, TE", "Fregni, FF", "Wiers, RW"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) enhances performance on working memory tasks.

Probes consisted of one item from the memory set, and one item that could have been presented as a distracter. TDCS was found to improve reaction time significantly only when the incorrect choice had been a distracter stimulus. The results thus support the notion that tDCS effects on working memory might be mediated by a specific effect on selective attention.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "512", "title": "Influence of transcranial direct current stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on pain related emotions: a study using electroencephalographic power spectrum analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "22327036", "authors": ["Maeoka, H", "Matsuo, A", "Hiyamizu, M", "Morioka, S", "Ando, H"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Pain is a multidimensional experience with sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative and affective-motivational components. Emotional factors such as unpleasantness or anxiety are known to have influence on pain in humans. The aim of this single-blinded, cross over study was to evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on emotional aspects of pain in pain alleviation. Fifteen subjects (5 females, 10 males) volunteered to participate in this study. In an oddball paradigm, three categories of 20 pictures (unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant) served as rare target pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). The power of the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-25 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz) frequency bands in the three categories were measured using electroencephalography during an oddball paradigm at pre- and post-anodal or sham tDCS above the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Results showed that the beta band power was significantly increased, and the alpha band power was significantly decreased during unpleasant pictures after anodal tDCS compared with sham tDCS. Furthermore, regarding unpleasant pictures, subjective reports of Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) for emotional valence after anodal tDCS showed a significant decrease of unpleasantness. Therefore, emotional aspects of pain may be effectively alleviated by tDCS of the left DLPFC as was shown not only by subjective evaluation, but also by objective observation of cerebral neural activity. This processing may be mediated by facilitation of the descending pain inhibitory system through enhancing neural activity of the left DLPFC.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Severe hypoxia affects exercise performance independently of afferent feedback and peripheral fatigue.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "22326385", "authors": ["Millet, GY", "Muthalib, M", "Jubeau, M", "Laursen, PB", "Nosaka, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that hypoxia centrally affects performance independently of afferent feedback and peripheral fatigue, we conducted two experiments under complete vascular occlusion of the exercising muscle under different systemic O(2) environmental conditions. In experiment 1, 12 subjects performed repeated submaximal isometric contractions of the elbow flexor to exhaustion (RCTE) with inspired O(2) fraction fixed at 9% (severe hypoxia, SevHyp), 14% (moderate hypoxia, ModHyp), 21% (normoxia, Norm), or 30% (hyperoxia, Hyper). The number of contractions (performance), muscle (biceps brachii), and prefrontal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) parameters and high-frequency paired-pulse (PS100) evoked responses to electrical muscle stimulation were monitored. In experiment 2, 10 subjects performed another RCTE in SevHyp and Norm conditions in which the number of contractions, biceps brachii electromyography responses to electrical nerve stimulation (M wave), and transcranial magnetic stimulation responses (motor-evoked potentials, MEP, and cortical silent period, CSP) were recorded. Performance during RCTE was significantly reduced by 10-15% in SevHyp (arterial O(2) saturation, SpO(2) = \u223c75%) compared with ModHyp (SpO(2) = \u223c90%) or Norm/Hyper (SpO(2) > 97%). Performance reduction in SevHyp occurred despite similar 1) metabolic (muscle NIRS parameters) and functional (changes in PS100 and M wave) muscle states and 2) MEP and CSP responses, suggesting comparable corticospinal excitability and spinal and cortical inhibition between SevHyp and Norm. It is concluded that, in SevHyp, performance and central drive can be altered independently of afferent feedback and peripheral fatigue. It is concluded that submaximal performance in SevHyp is partly reduced by a mechanism related directly to brain oxygenation.", "pages": "305-14"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Task-dependent changes in cortical excitability and effective connectivity: a combined TMS-EEG study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "22323647", "authors": ["Johnson, JS", "Kundu, B", "Casali, AG", "Postle, BR"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The brain's electrical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is known to be influenced by exogenous factors such as the frequency and intensity of stimulation and the orientation and positioning of the stimulating coil.

In the present study, we explored how changes in behavioral state affect the TMS-ER by perturbing the superior parietal lobule (SPL) with single pulses of TMS and measuring consequent differences in the frequency, strength, and spatial spread of TMS-evoked currents during the delay period of a spatial short-term memory task and during a period of passive fixation. Results revealed that task performance increased the overall strength of electrical currents induced by TMS, increased the spatial spread of TMS-evoked activity to distal brain regions, and increased the ability of TMS to reset the phase of ongoing broadband cortical oscillations. By contrast, task performance had little effect on the dominant frequency of the TMS-ER, both locally and at distal brain areas.
