In electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies, affected subjects have shown excessive spontaneous activity in the central auditory system. To further investigate the underlying central nervous component, we assessed motor cortex excitability in 19 patients with chronic tinnitus by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). When results were compared with data from 19 healthy controls matched for age and sex, we found significantly enhanced intracortical facilitation in tinnitus patients. These findings parallel excitability changes after limb amputation and experimental deafferentation. Our results give further support to crossmodal interactions involving neuroplastic changes in some forms of tinnitus and may help to better understand mechanisms of maladaptive cortical reorganisation involved in phantom perceptions.", "pages": "346-7; author reply 348-50"}, {"volume": "380", "title": "Altered motor cortex excitability in tinnitus patients: a hint at crossmodal plasticity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15849873", "authors": ["Langguth, B", "Eichhammer, P", "Zowe, M", "Kleinjung, T", "Jacob, P", "Binder, H", "Sand, P", "Hajak, G"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Tendon vibration is known to evoke perception of illusory movements, together with motor responses in the muscles antagonistic to those vibrated. In the present study, we assessed the perceptual and motor effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex during illusions of hand movements evoked by vibration of wrist muscle tendons. The results showed that transcranial magnetic stimulation could accelerate or decelerate the illusory movements, depending on the site and intensity of magnetic stimulation. Whenever transcranial magnetic stimulation decelerated illusory movements, motor responses decreased, whereas whenever it accelerated illusory movements, motor responses increased. We conclude that motor responses associated with movement illusions have a cortical stage, because they are affected by experimentally induced disruption of activity in intracortical networks.", "pages": "346-7; author reply 348-50"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex alters kinaesthesia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "15862911", "authors": ["Romaigu\u00e8re, P", "Calvin, S", "Roll, JP"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Intraoperative monitoring of transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) has been investigated recently as a means of preventing motor deficits associated with resection of intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCTs).

It has previously been reported that this form of repetitive TMS reduces the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), with the maximum effect occurring at 5-10 min after the end of stimulation. The present results show that cTBS preferentially decreases the amplitude of the corticospinal I1 wave, with approximately the same time course. This is consistent with a cortical origin of the effect on the MEP. However, other protocols that lead to MEP suppression, such as short-interval intracortical inhibition, are characterized by reduced excitability of late I waves (particularly I3), suggesting that cTBS suppresses MEPs through different mechanisms, such as long-term depression in excitatory synaptic connections.", "pages": "346-7; author reply 348-50"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Feasibility of electromyography-triggered neuromuscular stimulation as an adjunct to constraint-induced movement therapy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7922470", "authors": ["Fritz, SL", "Chiu, YP", "Malcolm, MP", "Patterson, TS", "Light, KE"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Physical therapy", "abstract": "Ataxia severity, cerebellar hemispheric blood flow (CHBF), ascorbate free radical (AFR), superoxide dismutase protein, superoxide scavenging activity, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compared before and after an 8-week course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 20 patients with spinocerebellar degenerations (SCD).

Surround inhibition (SI) is the process that inhibits neighboring muscles not involved in a particular task. The neuronal mechanisms of SI are not known, and it is possible that LAI might contribute to it. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with and without movement of the index finger, the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured of two functionally distinct target muscles of the hand (abductor digiti minimi muscle = ADM, 1st dorsal interosseus muscle = FDI). Electrical stimulation was applied 180 ms before TMS to either the fifth finger or the index finger. Both homotopic and heterotopic finger stimulation resulted in LAI without movement. With index finger movement, motor output further decreased with homo- and heterotopic stimulation in the ADM. In the moving FDI, however, there was no change with either homo- or heterotopic stimulation. Additionally, in the unstimulated movement trials, LAI increased with the amount of unintentional co-activation that occurred despite attempts to maintain the ADM at rest. However, with finger stimulation added, there were almost no increased MEPs despite co-activation.
