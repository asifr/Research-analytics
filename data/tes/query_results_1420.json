In this study, data gathered over a number of previously conducted experiments before and after tDCS, has been re-analyzed to investigate correlations between sex differences with respect to neuroplastic effects. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs), phosphene thresholds (PTs), and contrast sensitivity measurements (CSs) are used as indicators of the excitability of the primary visual cortex. The data revealed that cathodally induced excitability effects 10 min post stimulation with tDCS, showed no significant difference between genders. However, stimulation in the anodal direction revealed sex-specific effects: in women, anodal stimulation heightened cortical excitability significantly when compared to the age-matched male subject group. There was no significant difference between male and female subjects immediately after stimulation. These results indicate that sex differences exist within the visual cortex of humans, and may be subject to the influences of modulatory neurotransmitters or gonadal hormones which mirror short-term neuroplastic effects.", "pages": "77-81"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Different hemispheric specializations for pitch and audioverbal working memory.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18281901", "authors": ["Imm, JH", "Kang, E", "Youn, T", "Park, H", "Kim, JI", "Kang, JI", "Kim, SJ", "Lee, JD", "Park, HJ"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Critical times of involvement of areas important to working memory were examined both with pitch and audioverbal N-back tasks using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

For the pitch N-back task, interference with working memory, as evidenced by a significant increase in reaction time, was observed with TMS over the right hemisphere regions. In contrast, for the audioverbal N-back task, TMS resulted in significantly increased reaction time only for left inferior parietal TMS delivered 450 ms after stimulus onset.

This single-blind, sham-controlled crossover study recruited 15 healthy participants. A three-back verbal working-memory task was performed before, during, and 30 min after 1 mA anodal or sham tDCS. Anodal tDCS, compared with sham stimulation, significantly improved working-memory performance. Accuracy of response was significantly increased after 20 min of tDCS application, and was further enhanced after 30 min of stimulation. This effect was maintained for 30 min after the completion of stimulation.

Patients exhibit disabling deficits such as dysmetria, kinetic tremor and ataxia of stance/gait. We are currently lacking effective treatments in degenerative cerebellar ataxias. Animal models of cerebellar disorders and studies in ataxic patients have demonstrated that the excitability of the sensorimotor cortex is severely depressed in case of cerebellar lesion. These reduced levels of excitability are associated with learning deficits. Recent experimental data show that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the premotor cortex and low-frequency repetitive stimulation of the motor cortex (LFRSM1) restore the excitability of the motor cortex in hemicerebellectomized rats, reinstating the ability of the motor cortex to adapt to sustained peripheral stimulation. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that the combination of tDCS and contralateral LFRSM1 can improve human cerebellar ataxias. The proposed treatment consists of delivering trains of tDCS either in conjunction or in alternance with contralateral LFRSM1, in addition to application of peripheral nerve stimulation to sensitize the sensorimotor cortex. This hypothesis is to be tested in a procedure made of 3 steps in patients exhibiting a sporadic or inherited cerebellar disorder. First, patients are assessed clinically using validated scales of cerebellar ataxias and performing accepted quantified tests. Second, trains of tDCS and LFRSM1 are delivered, using a sham procedure in a cross-over design. Trains of peripheral stimulation are applied at peripheral nerves. Third, patients are re-assessed clinically and with quantified tests. Although grafting of stem cells and gene therapy are being developed, they will not be available soon. A successful treatment of combined neurostimulation would lead to a new and readily available approach in the management of cerebellar ataxias. This new therapy is safe, feasible and may bring symptomatic improvement.", "pages": "77-81"}, {"volume": "79", "title": "Facial nerve motor-evoked potential monitoring during skull base surgery predicts facial nerve outcome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "18245141", "authors": ["Fukuda, M", "Oishi, M", "Takao, T", "Saito, A", "Fujii, Y"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Combined prospective and retrospective.", "pages": "77-81"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation of the prefrontal cortex modulates the desire for specific foods.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18243412", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Orsati, F", "Pedrosa, W", "Fecteau, S", "Tome, FA", "Nitsche, MA", "Mecca, T", "Macedo, EC", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Boggio, PS"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Appetite", "abstract": "Evaluate 2 published criteria for interpreting motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in response to repetitive transcranial electrical stimulation (rTES) during surgery.", "pages": "77-81"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Factors influencing cortical silent period: optimized stimulus location, intensity and muscle contraction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15001989", "authors": ["S\u00e4is\u00e4nen, L", "Pirinen, E", "Teitti, S", "K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, M", "Julkunen, P", "M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, S", "Karhu, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "There is controversy regarding how to interpret MEPs elicited by rTES.
