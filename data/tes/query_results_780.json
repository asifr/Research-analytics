The aim of this study was to assess the genetic variation of brain plasticity, by comparing intrapair differences between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Plasticity was examined by a paired associative stimulation (PAS) in 32 healthy female twins (9 MZ and 7 DZ pairs, aged 22.6\u00b12.7 and 23.8\u00b13.6 years, respectively). Stimulation consisted of low frequency repetitive application of single afferent electric stimuli, delivered to the right median nerve, paired with a single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for activation of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB). Corticospinal excitability was monitored for 30 min following the intervention. PAS induced an increase in the amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the resting APB, compared to baseline. Intrapair differences, after baseline normalization, in the MEP amplitudes measured at 25-30 min post-intervention, were almost double for DZ (1.25) in comparison to MZ (0.64) twins (P =0.036). The heritability estimate for brain plasticity was found to be 0.68. This finding implicates that genetic factors may contribute significantly to interindividual variability in plasticity paradigms. Genetic factors may be important in adaptive brain reorganization involved in motor learning and rehabilitation from brain injury.", "pages": "297-306"}, {"volume": "2010", "title": "Effects of TMS coil geometry on stimulation specificity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10590986", "authors": ["Talebinejad, M", "Musallam, S"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The current spatial extent of neural activation is several millimeters but with greater specificity, transcranial magnetic stimulation can potentially deliver real time feedback to reinforce or extinguish behavior by exciting or inhibiting localized neural circuits. The specificity of transcranial magnetic stimulation is a function of the stimulation coil geometry. In this paper, a practical multilayer framework for the design of miniaturized stimulation coils is presented. This framework is based on a magnet wire fabricated from 2500 braided ultrafine wires. Effects of coil bending angle on stimulation specificity are examined using realistic finite element method simulations. A novel stimulation coil with one degree of freedom is also proposed that shows improved specificity over the conventional fixed coils. This type of coil could be potentially used as a feedback system for a bidirectional brain machine interface.", "pages": "297-306"}, {"volume": "2010", "title": "Simulation of a conductive shield plate for the focalization of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "20434997", "authors": ["Gasca, F", "Richter, L", "Schweikard, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The Finite Element (FE) method is used to obtain the 3D electric field distribution on a four-layer rat head model. The simulations show that the shield plate with a circular window can improve the focalization of stimulation, as quantitatively seen by computing the three-dimensional half power region (HPR). Focalization with the shield plate showed a clear compromise with the attenuation of the induced field. The results suggest that the shield plate can work as a helpful tool for conducting TMS rat experiments on specific targets.", "pages": "297-306"}, {"volume": "2010", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulator with controllable pulse parameters (cTMS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10672477", "authors": ["Peterchev, AV", "Murphy, DL", "Lisanby, SH"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

In this work we created a high resolution finite element model of a human head by segmentation of MRI images, and paid particular attention to the representation of the cortical sheet. This model was then used to calculate the electric field induced by two electrodes: an anode placed above the left motor cortex, and a cathode placed over the right eyebrow. The results showed that the maxima of the current density appear located on localized hotspots in the bottom of sulci and not on the cortical surface as would be expected from spherical models. This also applies to the components of the current density normal and tangential to the cortical surface. These results show that such highly detailed head models are needed to correctly predict the effects of tCS on cortical neurons.", "pages": "297-306"}, {"volume": "2010", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the presence of deep brain stimulation implants: Induced electrode currents.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10845069", "authors": ["Deng, ZD", "Lisanby, SH", "Peterchev, AV"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

One potential safety hazard is the induction of significant voltages in the subcutaneous leads in the scalp that could result in unintended electrical currents in the DBS electrode contacts. We measured ex-vivo the TMS-induced voltages and currents in DBS electrodes with the implantable pulse generator (IPG) set in various modes of operation. We show that voltages as high as 100 V resulting in currents as high as 83 mA can be induced in the DBS leads by a TMS pulse in all IPG modes. These currents are an order of magnitude higher than the normal DBS pulses, and could result in tissue damage.

It has been established as an effective stimulation technique to treat patients suffering from damaged brain functions. Although TMS is known to be painless and noninvasive, it can also be harmful to the brain by incorrect focusing and excessive stimulation which might result in seizure. Therefore there is ongoing research effort to elucidate and better understand the effect and mechanism of TMS. Lately Boundary element method (BEM) and Finite element method (FEM) have been used to simulate the electromagnetic phenomenon of TMS. However, there is a lack of general tools to generate the models of TMS due to some difficulties in realistic modeling of the human head and TMS coils. In this study, we have developed a toolbox through which one can generate high-resolution FE TMS models. The toolbox allows creating FE models of the head with isotropic and anisotropic electrical conductivities in five different tissues of the head and the coils in 3D. The generated TMS model is importable to FE software packages such as ANSYS for further and efficient electromagnetic analysis.

Here we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) guided using neuroimaging to increase learning rate in a novel, minimally guided discovery-learning paradigm. Ninety-six subjects identified threat-related objects concealed in naturalistic virtual surroundings used in real-world training. A variety of brain networks were found using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at different stages of learning, with two of these networks focused in right inferior frontal and right parietal cortex. Anodal 2.0 mA tDCS performed for 30 min over these regions in a series of single-blind, randomized studies resulted in significant improvements in learning and performance compared with 0.1 mA tDCS. This difference in performance increased to a factor of two after a one-hour delay. A dose-response effect of current strength on learning was also found. Taken together, these brain imaging and stimulation studies suggest that right frontal and parietal cortex are involved in learning to identify concealed objects in naturalistic surroundings. Furthermore, they suggest that the application of anodal tDCS over these regions can greatly increase learning, resulting in one of the largest effects on learning yet reported. The methods developed here may be useful to decrease the time required to attain expertise in a variety of settings.", "pages": "297-306"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Application of transcranial pulsed electrostimulation and an alternating electrostatic field to the treatment of \"restless legs\" syndrome in patients with Parkinson disease].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12161822", "authors": ["Korniukhina, EIu", "Chrnikova, LA", "Ivanova-Smolenskaia, IA", "Karabanov, AV"], "year": "", "journal": "Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebno\u012d fizichesko\u012d kultury", "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the possibility to use combined therapy including application of transcranial pulsed electrostimulation and an alternating electrostatic field to the treatment of \"restless legs\" syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson disease.

We recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from extensor and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles at rest and during FCR muscle contraction after the application of TES on FCR. TES application conditions were changed intensities, frequencies, and trains. In addition, to evaluate the contribution of M1 inhibitory circuits to the effects of TES application, we also recorded MEPs using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. In resting muscle states, an increase in TES intensity resulted in an increase in MEP ratio in both the muscles. In contrast, when TES was applied to FCR during contraction, MEP ratios of both the muscles decreased with increased number of pulse trains. However, under both the states, MEP ratios decreased induced by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in extensor carpi radialis to which TES was not applied. Excitability changes in M1 induced by TES application were reversibly modulated depending on the presence or absence of voluntary drive. This study showed that the therapy and the voluntary drive of the target muscles act together, and complement the effects of each other, which may be beneficial for optimizing the rehabilitation if the therapy accompanies voluntary drive.", "pages": "297-306"}]
