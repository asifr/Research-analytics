This phenomenon, called object substitution masking, has recently been proposed to reflect information updating in object-level representation, with perception of the target and the mask belonging to a single object through apparent motion. We investigated this issue by applying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over V5/MT+, specialized in visual motion processing. The transient functional disruption of V5/MT+ produced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation attenuated object substitution masking, while sham stimulation did not. Our results suggest that object substitution masking is mediated by normal functioning of V5/MT+.

Healthy subjects reporting reliable induction of phosphenes by occipital transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) underwent 60 min of complete LD. Phosphene threshold (PT) was measured before (T0), after 45 min (T1) and 60 min (T2) of LD, and then every 10 min after light re-exposure until recovery to T0 values. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) (at 1 or 10 Hz) was applied in separate sessions during the last 15 min of LD. PTs significantly decreased after 45 min of LD. rTMS differentially modified the effects of 60 min LD on PTs depending on stimulation frequency. One hertz rTMS did not change the decreasing of PT values as observed in baseline condition, but significantly prolonged the time to recover T0 PT values after light re-exposure. By contrast, 10 Hz rTMS significantly increased PT and the time to recover T0 PT values after light re-exposure was shortened. The results of this study show that the modulatory effects of different rTMS frequencies on visual cortex critically depend on the pre-existing excitability state of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits, and provide novel insights into the neurophysiological changes that take place in the visual cortex following functional visual deafferentation.", "pages": "527-33"}, {"volume": "252", "title": "Corticomotor organisation and motor function in multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "9818853", "authors": ["Thickbroom, GW", "Byrnes, ML", "Archer, SA", "Kermode, AG", "Mastaglia, FL"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Episodic memory supports conscious remembrance of everyday experience. Prior functional neuroimaging data indicate that episodic encoding during phonological task performance is correlated with activation in bilateral posterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (pVLPFC), although uncertainty remains regarding whether these prefrontal regions make necessary contributions to episodic memory formation. Using functional MRI data to guide application of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS), this study examined the necessity of left and right pVLPFC for episodic encoding (as expressed through subsequent memory performance). To assess the timing of critical computations, pVLPFC function was transiently disrupted at different poststimulus onset times while subjects made syllable decisions about visually presented familiar and unfamiliar words; subsequent memory for these stimuli was measured. Results revealed that left pVLPFC disruption during encoding of familiar words impaired subsequent memory, expressed as a decline in recognition confidence, with disruption being maximal at 380 ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, right pVLPFC disruption facilitated subsequent memory for familiar words, expressed as an increase in medium confidence recognition, with this facilitation being maximal at 380 ms. Finally, phonological (syllable) decision accuracy was facilitated by right pVLPFC disruption, with this effect being maximal at 340 ms, but was unaffected by left pVLPFC disruption. These findings suggest that left pVLPFC mechanisms onset between 300 and 400 ms during phonological processing of words, with these mechanisms appearing necessary for effective episodic encoding. In contrast, disruption of correlated mechanisms in right pVLPFC facilitates encoding, perhaps by inducing a functional shift in the mechanisms engaged during learning.", "pages": "527-33"}]
