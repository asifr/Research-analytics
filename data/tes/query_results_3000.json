The time course of these changes is poorly understood. In this study, we addressed the question whether a short period of light deprivation (minutes to a few hours) can elicit such changes in humans. Noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human occipital cortex can evoke the perception of flashes or spots of light (phosphenes). To assess changes in visual cortex excitability following light deprivation, we measured the minimum intensity of stimulation required to elicit phosphenes (phosphene threshold) and the number of phosphenes elicited by different TMS stimulus intensities (stimulus-response curves). A reduced phosphene threshold was detected 45 min after the onset of light deprivation and persisted for the entire deprivation period (180 min). Following re-exposure to light, phosphene thresholds returned to predeprivation values over 120 min. Stimulus-response curves were significantly enhanced in association with this intervention. In a second experiment, we studied the effects of light deprivation on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals elicited by photic stimulation. fMRI results showed increased visual cortex activation after 60 min of light deprivation that persisted following 30 min of re-exposure to light. Our results demonstrated a substantial increase in visual cortex excitability. These changes may underlie behavioral gains reported in humans and animals associated with light deprivation.", "pages": "529-34"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "[Monitoring of motor evoked potentials during insertion of iliosacral screws for reconstruction of pelvic fracture in two patients].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "10846383", "authors": ["Kawaraguchi, Y", "Kakimoto, M", "Inoue, S", "Sakamoto, T", "Kawaguchi, M", "Kitaguchi, K", "Furaya, H"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Masui.

We described 2 patients who had developed significant decrease in MEP during the insertion of iliosacral screws for reconstruction of pelvic fractures. In both patients, MEPs were successfully obtained prior to the insertion under general anesthesia and partial neuromuscular blockade (propofol, ketamine, fentanyl, and nitrous oxide in oxygen: vecuronium), but reduced in association with the insertion. In one patient, they were restored by the re-insertion of screw and no new neurological deficits were observed postoperatively. However, in another patient, the decrease was not normalized and he suffered from paresis of the lower extremities after the surgery. We consider that intraoperative changes in MEPs could precisely predict postoperative motor function.", "pages": "529-34"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Posture-related changes of soleus H-reflex excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "10842270", "authors": ["Goulart, F", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Alvarez, R"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "We investigated whether the modulatory effects of segmental and descending inputs on the soleus H reflex are modified by postural conditions. Fourteen healthy volunteers received a transcranial magnetic stimulus (TMS) or percutaneous electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve (PTN), preceding by 0 to 400 ms the elicitation of the soleus H reflex in supine, sitting, and standing positions. In all positions, TMS induced an early period of facilitation at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging between 5 and 35 ms. In supine and sitting positions, there was a second period of facilitation at ISIs between 60 and 90 ms, which was absent or significantly reduced in the standing position. PTN induced a strong inhibition of the H reflex in all positions up to 125 ms. In supine and sitting positions, inhibition continued up to 400 ms, whereas it was significantly reduced or completely absent beyond 125 ms in the standing position. These results demonstrate posture-related differences in the modulatory effects of descending and segmental inputs on the excitability of the H-reflex circuit.", "pages": "529-34"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Contralateral neglect induced by right posterior parietal rTMS in healthy subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "10841369", "authors": ["Fierro, B", "Brighina, F", "Oliveri, M", "Piazza, A", "La Bua, V", "Buffa, D", "Bisiach, E"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "We applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in order to induce interference on visuo-spatial perception in 11 healthy subjects.

Unexpectedly, we also found that TMS-induced suppression progressively disappeared during three weeks of repeated TMS experiments. However, it was only suppression during the last two periods that disappeared; suppression during the first period remained undiminished. When subjects were then presented with dimmer letters, suppression reappeared.
