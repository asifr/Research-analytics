The aim of the present study was therefore to identify these pathways and to analyse the effect of TMS on spinal neurons. In 19 rats, TMS evoked responses bilaterally in forelimb (biceps brachii; BB) and hindlimb muscles (tibialis anterior). The latency and amplitude of these motor-evoked responses (MEPs) were highly variable and depended strongly on the coil position and the stimulation intensity. The most frequently observed latencies for the BB MEPs could be divided into three groups: 3-6 ms, 8-12 ms and 14-18 ms. Lesions in the dorsal columns, which destroyed the corticospinal tract at C2 and C5, significantly depressed MEPs in the mid- and high-latency ranges, but not those in the low-latency range. Lesions in the dorsolateral funiculus, which interrupted the rubrospinal tract, had no effect on MEPs in any of the latency ranges. By contrast, bilateral lesion of the reticulospinal tract and other ventro-laterally located descending pathways abolished all responses. Intracellular recordings from 54 cervical motoneurons in five rats revealed that TMS evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at latencies that corresponded well with those of the BB MEPs. The short-latency EPSPs had rise times of around 1 ms, suggesting that they were mediated by a monosynaptic pathway. EPSPs with longer latencies had considerably longer rise times, which indicated conduction through polysynaptic pathways. Selective electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract in the brainstem was performed in seven rats, where intracellular recordings from 70 motoneurons revealed that the earliest EPSPs and MEPs evoked by TMS were not mediated by the corticospinal tract, but by other descending motor pathways. Together, these results showed that in the rat TMS activates several descending pathways that converge on common spinal interneurons and motoneurons. Our observations confirm that the corticospinal tract has weak (and indirect) projections to cervical spinal motoneurons.", "pages": "1166-70"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Ankle position and voluntary contraction alter maximal M waves in soleus and tibialis anterior.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "17295303", "authors": ["Frigon, A", "Carroll, TJ", "Jones, KE", "Zehr, EP", "Collins, DF"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "The activation-flow coupling describes a mechanism, which adapts local cerebral blood flow in accordance with the underlying neuronal activity. It was suggested that the mechanism helps in differentiation between Alzheimer and vascular type of dementia. We combined EEG and Doppler techniques and assessed integrity of the activation-flow coupling in the occipital cortex utilizing a visual stimulation task. Alzheimer patients (MMSE: 18+/-8 points, DemTect 5+/-4 points) without signs of vascular lesions on a MRI scan and vascular demented patients (MMSE: 20+/-6 points, DemTect 6+/-3 points; MRI Fazekas score 7+/-3 points) were compared with data from an age-matched control group. Evoked flow velocity responses in the posterior cerebral artery were analysed according to a control system model specifying the parameters gain, attenuation, natural frequency and rate time. Evoked potentials were analysed for the N(75)-P(100) amplitude difference. Vascular demented patients exhibited a significant decreased gain parameter and increased attenuation parameter indicating severe cerebrovascular dysfunction. Also, the potential amplitudes were significantly decreased indicating neuronal damage due to the vascular disease process. Alzheimer patients did not differ in parameters as compared to the control group supporting other reports of intact occipital function at this stage of disease. Simultaneous assessment of electrical as well as vascular integrity might help in differentiating the most frequent forms of dementia.", "pages": "1166-70"}, {"volume": "180", "title": "Laterality of interhemispheric inhibition depends on handedness.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17287992", "authors": ["B\u00e4umer, T", "Dammann, E", "Bock, F", "Kl\u00f6ppel, S", "Siebner, HR", "M\u00fcnchau, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
