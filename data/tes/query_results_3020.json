Comparing amplitudes of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) with those obtained by cortical TMS of lower-lip muscles, we found a considerable overlap between the areas from which reproducible MEPs of APB and lower-lip muscles could be elicited. However, there was a statistically significant separation of the two areas, the APB area being placed more medially. With regard to short examination procedures it can be concluded that a separation between distal arm and facial muscles is possible not only by two-dimensional cortical mapping procedures, but also by one-dimensional cortical TMS.", "pages": "96-9"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Motor cortex disinhibition in acute stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10727918", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Storch, P", "Fritsch, A", "Weiller, C"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To test whether a disinhibition occurs in the human motor cortex after stroke.", "pages": "96-9"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Central motor conduction to lower limb after transcranial magnetic stimulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10727914", "authors": ["Restivo, DA", "Giuffrida, S", "Rapisarda, G", "Antonuzzo, A", "Saponara, R", "Reggio, A", "Trovato Salinaro, A", "Raffaele, R", "Domina, E", "Trovato, A", "Condorelli, DF", "Pennisi, G"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Patients with a mild to moderate hemiparesis after an acute unilateral ischemic stroke were compared with age-matched healthy controls.
