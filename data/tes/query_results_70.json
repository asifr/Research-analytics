In humans, if and how visual cortices perform temporal processing remains unclear. Here we show that both primary visual cortex (V1) and extrastriate area V5/MT are causally involved in encoding and keeping time in memory and that this involvement is independent from low-level visual processing. Most importantly we demonstrate that V1 and V5/MT come into play simultaneously and seem to be functionally linked during interval encoding, whereas they operate serially (V1 followed by V5/MT) and seem to be independent while maintaining temporal information in working memory. These data help to refine our knowledge of the functional properties of human visual cortex, highlighting the contribution and the temporal dynamics of V1 and V5/MT in the processing of the temporal aspects of visual information.", "pages": "12423-9"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation for refractory focal status epilepticus in the intensive care unit.", "keywords": ["Impedance method", "Induced electric field", "Secondary magnetic field", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)"], "issue": "10", "pmid": "23876929", "authors": ["Liu, A", "Pang, T", "Herman, S", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Rotenberg, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Seizure : the journal of the British Epilepsy Association", "abstract": "To examine the efficacy and safety profile of antiepileptic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for refractory status epilepticus (RSE) in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

Particularly we investigated the impact of head model resolution on the estimated distribution of the induced electric field, as well as the role of the stimulating magnetic coil model in TMS. Using the impedance method we calculated the induced electric field inside a realistic numerical phantom of the human head from a commercially available eight-shaped coil, which was modeled in two ways. The results showed that finer resolution of the model has better performance at tissue interfaces eliminating numerical artifacts of local peaks. Furthermore, the geometrical details of a TMS coil must be taken into account since the predicted amount of volume of brain tissue involved can have great variation.

The extent of the relative S1 contribution in producing skilled reaching movements, however, is still unclear. Here we used anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is able to alter polarity-specific excitability in the S1, to facilitate skilled movement in intact behaving rats. We hypothesized that the critical role of S1 in reaching performance can be enhanced by bilateral tDCS. Pretrained rats were assigned to control or stimulation conditions: (1) UnAno: the unilateral application of an anodal current to the side contralateral to the paw preferred for reaching; (2) BiAno1: bilateral anodal current; (3) BiAno2: a bilateral anodal current with additional 30ms of 65\u03bcA pulses every 5s. Rats received tDCS (65\u03bcA; 10min/rat) to the S1 during skilled reach training for 20 days (online-effect phase). After-effect assessment occurred for the next ten days in the absence of electrical stimulation. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of online-effects of tDCS showed that UnAno and BiAno1 somatosensory stimulation significantly improve skilled reaching performance. Bilateral BiAno1 stimulation was associated with greater qualitative functional improvement than unilateral UnAno stimulation. tDCS-induced improvements were not observed in the after-effects phase. Quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis revealed that somatosensory tDCS bilaterally increases cortical neural density. The findings emphasize the central role of bilateral somatosensory feedback in skill acquisition through modulation of cortico-motor excitability.", "pages": "12423-9"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Effect of different approaches to target force on transcranial magnetic stimulation responses.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "23853044", "authors": ["Gruet, M", "Temesi, J", "Rupp, T", "Millet, GY", "Verges, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "A range of techniques are now available for modulating the activity of the brain in healthy people and people with neurological conditions.

In clinical neuroscience, the techniques offer the promise of correcting abnormal activity, such as when a stroke leaves a brain area underactive.
