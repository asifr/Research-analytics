The history of electrophysiology starts with the discovery of the biological effects of DC and as early as two centuries ago scalp DC was used to treat mental disorder. Psychophysiological investigations suggested a possible effect of scalp DC in humans. More recently several studies assessed, with motor potentials evoked by transcranial brain stimulation, the motor-cortical excitability changes induced by scalp DC. Even weak DCs pass through the scalp and influence human brain activity. DCs delivered at relatively strong intensities (1 mA) and for long periods (10 min or so), not only influence (either increase or decrease) brain excitability during their application in normal subjects, but induce persistent changes in excitability after their offset that, at least in the motor cortex, can last for almost 1 h. Scalp DC might represent a non-invasive simple and valuable potential treatment for psychiatric and neurologic diseases with changes in brain excitability or focally abnormal (increased or decreased) function.", "pages": "600-4"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Interference with vision by TMS over the occipital pole: a fourth period.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "12657905", "authors": ["Corthout, E", "Hallett, M", "Cowey, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Respiratory muscles respond to a subcortical automatic command and to a neocortical voluntary command. In diseases such as stroke or motor neurone disease, an abnormal diaphragmatic response to single transcranial magnetic stimuli can identify a central source for respiratory disorders, but this is not likely to be the case in disorders affecting intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms. This study describes the response of the diaphragm to paired transcranial magnetic stimulation. Thirteen normal subjects were studied (age range, 22 to 43 years; 7 men; phrenic conduction, <6.8 msec; latency of diaphragmatic motor evoked potential, <20.5 msec). Motor evoked potentials in response to paired stimulation were obtained in eight subjects only, with the motor threshold in the remaining five subjects too high to absorb the loss of power inherent in the double-stimulation montage. Interstimulus intervals less than 5 msec resulted in a statistically significant inhibition (p < 0.01 for interstimulus intervals of 1 and 3 ms), whereas intervals longer than 6 msec were facilitatory (maximal, 15 msec). The diaphragmatic pattern matched that of the biceps brachii. The authors conclude that it is possible to study intracortical inhibition and facilitation of diaphragmatic control, although not in all subjects. Technical improvement should alleviate current limitations and make paired transcranial magnetic stimulation a tool to study respiratory muscle abnormalities in settings in which intracortical interactions are important, such as movement disorders.", "pages": "600-4"}]
