To provide more comprehensive monitoring, 11 techniques have been developed to monitor motor nerve root and spinal cord motor function. These techniques include: 1. neuromuscular junction monitoring, 2. recording free-run electromyography (EMG) for monitoring segmental spinal nerve root function, 3. electrical stimulation to help determine the correct placement of pedicle screws, 4. electrical impedance testing to help determine the correct placement of pedicle screws, 5. electrical stimulation of motor spinal nerve roots, 6. electrical stimulation to help determine the correct placement of iliosacral screws, 7. recording H-reflexes, 8. recording F-responses, 9. recording the sacral reflex, 10. recording intralimb and interlimb reflexes and 11. recording monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes during dorsal root rhizotomy.", "pages": "623-7"}]
