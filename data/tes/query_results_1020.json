However, the effect of regular physical activity on human motor cortex function is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine motor cortex plasticity for a small hand muscle in highly active and sedentary individuals. Electromyographic recordings were obtained from the left abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle of 14 active and 14 sedentary subjects (aged 18-38 yrs). The extent of physical activity was assessed by questionnaire, where the physically active subjects performed >150 min per day moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity on at least 5 days per week, whereas the sedentary group performed <20 min per day of physical activity on no more than 3 days per week. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right hemisphere was used to assess changes in APB motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), input-output curve (IO curve), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Neuroplastic changes were induced using paired-associative stimulation (PAS), which consisted of 90 paired stimuli (0.05 Hz for 30 min) of median nerve electrical stimulation at the wrist followed 25 ms later by TMS to the hand area of motor cortex. The IO curve slope was 35% steeper in individuals with increased physical activity (combined before and after PAS, P < 0.05), suggesting increased motor cortex excitability, although there was no difference in SICI or CSP between groups. PAS induced an increase in MEP amplitude in the physically active subjects (54% increase compared with before, P < 0.01), but no significant facilitation in the sedentary subjects. We conclude that participation in regular physical activity may offer global benefits to motor cortex function that enhances neuroplasticity, which could improve motor learning and neurorehabilitation in physically active individuals.", "pages": "5831-42"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Prefrontal hemodynamic changes produced by anodal direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "14980729", "authors": ["Merzagora, AC", "Foffani, G", "Panyavin, I", "Mordillo-Mateos, L", "Aguilar, J", "Onaral, B", "Oliviero, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been investigated for the treatment of many neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. Its main effect is to modulate the cortical excitability depending on the polarity of the current applied. However, understanding the mechanisms by which these modulations are induced and persist is still an open question. A possible marker indicating a change in cortical activity is the subsequent variation in regional blood flow and metabolism. These variations can be effectively monitored using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which offers a noninvasive and portable measure of regional blood oxygenation state in cortical tissue. We studied healthy volunteers at rest and evaluated the changes in cortical oxygenation related to tDCS using fNIRS. Subjects were tested after active stimulation (12 subjects) and sham stimulation (10 subjects). Electrodes were applied at two prefrontal locations; stimulation lasted 10 min and fNIRS data were then collected for 20 min. The anodal stimulation induced a significant increase in oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentration compared to sham stimulation. Additionally, the effect of active 10-min tDCS was localized in time and lasted up to 8-10 min after the end of the stimulation. The cathodal stimulation manifested instead a negligible effect. The changes induced by tDCS on HbO(2), as captured by fNIRS, agreed with the results of previous studies. Taken together, these results help clarify the mechanisms underlying the regional alterations induced by tDCS and validate the use of fNIRS as a possible noninvasive method to monitor the neuromodulation effect of tDCS.", "pages": "5831-42"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Corticomotor plasticity and learning of a ballistic thumb training task are diminished in older adults.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "14978288", "authors": ["Rogasch, NC", "Dartnall, TJ", "Cirillo, J", "Nordstrom, MA", "Semmler, JG"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "This study examined changes in corticomotor excitability and plasticity after a thumb abduction training task in young and old adults. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained from right abductor pollicis brevis (APB, target muscle) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM, control muscle) in 14 young (18-24 yr) and 14 old (61-82 yr) adults. The training task consisted of 300 ballistic abductions of the right thumb to maximize peak thumb abduction acceleration (TAAcc). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left primary motor cortex was used to assess changes in APB and ADM motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) before, immediately after, and 30 min after training. No differences in corticomotor excitability (resting and active TMS thresholds, MEP input-output curves) or SICI were observed in young and old adults before training. Motor training resulted in improvements in peak TAAcc in young (177% improvement, P < 0.001) and old (124%, P = 0.005) subjects, with greater improvements in young subjects (P = 0.002). Different thumb kinematics were observed during task performance, with increases in APB EMG related to improvements in peak TAAcc in young (r(2) = 0.46, P = 0.008) but not old (r(2) = 0.09, P = 0.3) adults. After training, APB MEPs were 50% larger (P < 0.001 compared with before) in young subjects, with no change after training in old subjects (P = 0.49), suggesting reduced use-dependent corticomotor plasticity with advancing age. These changes were specific to APB, because no training-related change in MEP amplitude was observed in ADM. No significant association was observed between change in APB MEP and improvement in TAAcc with training in individual young and old subjects. SICI remained unchanged after training in both groups, suggesting that it was not responsible for the diminished use-dependent corticomotor plasticity for this task in older adults.", "pages": "5831-42"}, {"volume": "147", "title": "Diffuse analgesic effects of unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in healthy volunteers.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "15066531", "authors": ["Nahmias, F", "Debes, C", "de Andrade, DC", "Mhalla, A", "Bouhassira, D"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "We investigated the analgesic effects of unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in two models of experimental pain in healthy volunteers. Two studies were carried out in parallel in two groups of 26 paid healthy volunteers. The effects of active or sham rTMS (frequency, 10Hz; intensity, 80% resting motor threshold) applied to the right M1 or DLPFC were compared in a double-blind randomized cross-over design. In the first series of experiments, we analyzed the effects of rTMS on thermal (heat and cold) detection and pain thresholds measured on both hands and the left foot, by standardized quantitative sensory testing methods. In the second series of experiments, we measured the effects of M1 or DLPFC rTMS on the threshold and recruitment curves of the RIII nociceptive reflex evoked by ipsilateral electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and recorded on the biceps femoris of both lower limbs. In both studies, measurements were taken before and up to 60min after the end of rTMS. Active rTMS of both M1 and DLPFC significantly increased the thermal pain thresholds, measured for both hands and the left foot, this effect being most marked for cold pain. These effects, which lasted at least 1h after rTMS, were selective because they were not associated with changes in non-painful thermal sensations. By contrast, the second study showed that rTMS of M1 or DLPFC had no significant effect on the threshold or recruitment curve of the nociceptive flexion RIII reflex. Our findings demonstrate that unilateral rTMS of M1 or DLPFC induces diffuse and selective analgesic effects in healthy volunteers. The lack of effect on the RIII reflex suggests that such analgesic effects may not depend on the activation of descending inhibitory systems.", "pages": "5831-42"}, {"volume": "177", "title": "Disorders of consciousness: further pathophysiological insights using motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15126046", "authors": ["Lapitskaya, N", "Coleman, MR", "Nielsen, JF", "Gosseries, O", "de Noordhout, AM"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive means of investigating the function, plasticity, and excitability of the human brain. TMS induces a brief intracranial electrical current, which produces action potentials in excitable cells. Stimulation applied over the motor cortex can be used to measure overall excitability of the corticospinal system, somatotopic representation of muscles, and subsequent plastic changes following injury. The facilitation and inhibition characteristics of the cerebral cortex can also be compared using the modulatory effect of a conditioning stimulus preceding a test stimulus. So called paired-pulse protocols have been used in humans and animals to assess GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid)-ergic function and may have a future role directing therapeutic interventions. Indeed, repetitive magnetic stimulation, where intracranial currents are induced by repetitive stimulation higher than 1 Hz, has been shown to modulate brain responses to sensory and cognitive stimulation. Here, we summarize information gathered using TMS with patients in coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state. Although in the early stages of investigation, there is preliminary evidence that TMS represents a promising tool by which to elucidate the pathophysiological sequelae of impaired consciousness and potentially direct future therapeutic interventions. We will discuss the methodology of work conducted to date, as well as debate the general limitations and pitfalls of TMS studies in patients with altered states of consciousness.", "pages": "5831-42"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Research with transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of aphasia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "14724259", "authors": ["Martin, PI", "Naeser, MA", "Ho, M", "Treglia, E", "Kaplan, E", "Baker, EH", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current neurology and neuroscience reports", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to improve language behavior, including naming, in stroke patients with chronic, nonfluent aphasia.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the frontal eye fields (FEFs) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). A single pulse was delivered 60, 30, or 0 ms before a discrimination target was presented at, or next to, the target of a saccade in preparation. Results showed that the known enhancement of discrimination performance specific to locations to which eye movements are being prepared was enhanced by early TMS on the FEF contralateral to eye movement direction, whereas TMS on the IPS resulted in a general performance increase.
