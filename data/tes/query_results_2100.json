Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "We examined whether the recruitment properties of the corticospinal pathway to intrinsic hand muscles are influenced by variations of the shoulder joint angle. Abductor digiti minimi (ADM) motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation were examined during different static positions of the shoulder joint in the horizontal plane from 30 degrees adduction to 30 degrees abduction with respect to the neutral position at 0 degrees, while elbow and wrist joints were constrained statically at 90 degrees and 180 degrees respectively. We found that 30 degrees abduction of the shoulder significantly depressed MEP size and prolonged MEP latency in comparison with 30 degrees shoulder adduction. The neutral shoulder angle position (at 0 degrees ) significantly reduced MEP size but had no effect on MEP latency in comparison with 30 degrees shoulder abduction. The input-output relationship between MEP size and stimulus intensity was sigmoidal. The plateau value and maximum slope were significantly lower at 30 degrees abduction than at 30 degrees adduction of the shoulder. However, the threshold value did not differ significantly between the two positions. To differentiate excitability changes at cortical versus subcortical sites, intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were assessed using a paired-magnetic pulse paradigm. A significant decrease in ICF was observed after changing shoulder position from 30 degrees adduction to 30 degrees abduction. In contrast, no variation in the amount of ICI occurred in relation to the same changes in shoulder position. ADM F-waves elicited by electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist were significantly decreased at 30 degrees shoulder abduction in comparison with 30 degrees adduction. A similar pattern was observed in one subject in whom the H-reflex could be exceptionally elicited in ADM. We conclude that shoulder position influences the recruitment efficiency (gain) of the corticospinal volleys to motoneurons of intrinsic hand muscles. It is proposed that activity of peripheral receptors signalling static shoulder position influences corticomotor excitability of hand muscles both at the cortical and at the spinal level. This modulation may be functionally relevant when reaching to grasp objects.", "pages": "374-82"}, {"volume": "562", "title": "Increased corticospinal excitability after 5 Hz rTMS over the human supplementary motor area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "15513947", "authors": ["Matsunaga, K", "Maruyama, A", "Fujiwara, T", "Nakanishi, R", "Tsuji, S", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can produce effects not only at the site of stimulation but also at distant sites to which it projects. Here we examined the connection between supplementary motor area (SMA) and the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1(Hand)) by testing whether prolonged repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the SMA can produce changes in excitability of the M1(Hand) after the end of the stimulus train. We evaluated motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and the cortical silent period (CSP) evoked by a single-pulse TMS, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) produced by a paired-pulse TMS, and forearm flexor H reflexes before and after 750 pulses of 5 Hz rTMS over SMA at an intensity of 110% active motor threshold (AMT) for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. The amplitude of MEPs recorded from the right FDI muscle at rest as well as during voluntary contraction increased for at least 10 min after the end of rTMS, although the duration of the CSP, SICI and ICF did not change. There was no effect on H reflexes in the flexor carpi radialis muscle, even though the amplitude of the MEP obtained from the same muscle increased after rTMS. The effects on MEPs depended on the intensity of rTMS and were spatially specific to the SMA proper. We suggest that 5 Hz rTMS over SMA can induce a short-lasting facilitation in excitability of the M1(Hand) compatible with the anatomical connections between SMA and the M1(Hand).", "pages": "374-82"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Mirror movements and ipsilateral motor evoked potentials in ALS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10541752", "authors": ["Krampfl, K", "Mohammadi, B", "Komissarow, L", "Dengler, R", "Bufler, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders : official publication of the World Federation of Neurology, Research Group on Motor Neuron Diseases", "abstract": "It can be difficult to detect upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement in early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The present study tested the usefulness of mirror movements (MMs), i.e., contralateral coactivation of hand muscles, as a UMN sign in ALS. Thirty-seven patients with possible, probable or definite ALS and 19 patients with suspected ALS without clinical signs of UMN involvement, 21 disease controls and 15 healthy volunteers were included. MMs were studied clinically, electromyographically and by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), looking for ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (IMEPs). MMs were observed clinically in 15 ALS patients (27%) and electromyographically in 28 (50%). IMEPs in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle following TMS were recorded in 34 (61%) of all ALS patients and in nine (47%) out of 19 patients with suspected ALS, but not in healthy controls. Central motor conduction times were prolonged in 15 ALS patients (27%). It is concluded that MMs, especially if studied by EMG and TMS (IMEPs) can essentially improve detection of UMN involvement, especially in early stages of ALS.", "pages": "374-82"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "The cortical representation of foveal stimuli: evidence from quadrantanopia and TMS-induced suppression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10639396", "authors": ["Chiang, TC", "Walsh, V", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Brain research.

In a letter/digit classification task, the patient responded accurately to targets presented in the upper visual field, for all horizontal eccentricities. In the lower visual field, she failed to discriminate letters from digits when targets were presented in the right, but not the left visual field (RVF and LVF, respectively). This pattern was also true for the foveal targets, with poor performance to foveal-RVF (0.5 degrees to the right of fixation) but not foveal-LVF (0.5 degrees to the left of fixation) targets. Similar patterns of normal performance to LVF but not RVF or foveal-RVF targets were observed in a group of nine normal observers when TMS was applied over their left occipital cortex. Complementary impairments to LVF and foveal-LVF target classification were induced with TMS over the right occipital cortex. Thus, we have induced an hemianopic pattern in normal observers contralateral to the magnetically stimulated hemisphere. This correspondence between real and TMS-induced visual field defects is further evidence, in neurologically intact subjects, that the cortical representation of the fovea is split between the two hemispheres along the vertical meridian.", "pages": "374-82"}, {"volume": "143", "title": "Inhibitory effect of BIBN4096BS on cephalic vasodilatation induced by CGRP or transcranial electrical stimulation in the rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "10690992", "authors": ["Petersen, KA", "Birk, S", "Doods, H", "Edvinsson, L", "Olesen, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "abstract": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of migraine via activation of CGRP receptors in the trigeminovascular system. The CGRP receptor antagonist, BIBN4096BS, has proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine attacks and represents a new therapeutic principle. We used an improved closed cranial window model to measure changes of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and cortical pial artery/arteriole diameter (PA) and changes in local cortical cerebral blood flow (LCBF(Flux)) in anaesthetised artificially ventilated rats. The ability of BIBN4096BS (i.v.) to prevent the vasodilatatory actions of rat-alphaCGRP, betaCGRP and endogenously released CGRP following transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) was investigated. BIBN4096BS was per se without vasoactive effect on any of the measured variables and significantly inhibited the hypotension induced by both types of CGRP (P < 0.001). The alphaCGRP induced MMA dilatation was reduced from 97.4 +/- 14 to 2.1 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.001) and the betaCGRP induced dilatation was fully blocked by BIBN4096BS. ID(50) was 5.4 +/- 1.6 microg kg(-1) for alphaCGRP and 16.3 +/- 1.6 microg kg(-1) for betaCGRP. Transcranial electrical stimulation induced a 119.1 +/- 6.9% increase in MMA diameter. BIBN4096BS (333 microg kg(-1)) attenuated this increase (19.8 +/- 2.1%) (P < 0.001). Systemic CGRP and TES induced an increase in PA diameter that was not significantly inhibited by BIBN4096BS. The CGRP induced increase in LCBF(Flux) was similar not prevented by the antagonist. We suggest that systemic BIBN4096BS exerts its inhibitory action mainly on large dural blood vessels (MMA).", "pages": "374-82"}, {"volume": "162", "title": "Corticospinal disinhibition during dual action.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11222650", "authors": ["Sohn, YH", "Kang, SY", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Such interference often causes altered activation of the cortical area representing each task compared to the single task condition. We investigated changes in corticospinal inhibition during dual action by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was applied to the left motor cortex, triggered by right leg movement (tibialis anterior muscle) while the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle was moderately activated (10-20% of the maximal voluntary contraction). The background electromyography (EMG) activity of ADM was measured before and during the leg movement. The silent period (SP) and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) following magnetic stimulation in active ADM were compared for the conditions with and without leg movement. The mean area of the rectified EMG activity of ADM did not alter, while the SP was significantly shortened during leg movement compared to that without leg movement. MEP amplitude was comparable between the two conditions. These results suggest that corticospinal inhibition tested by the SP duration is reduced during the movement of another body part, presumably in order to help maintain muscle force by compensating interference-related alteration in motor cortical activation.", "pages": "374-82"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "From the electrodiagnostics lab: where transcranial stimulation, H-reflexes and F-responses monitor cord function intraoperatively.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11502912", "authors": ["Leppanen, RE"], "year": "", "journal": "The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society", "abstract": "The electrical point stimulation system (P-STIM) reflects a new, miniaturized system for pain therapy through ear acupuncture.
