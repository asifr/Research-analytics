Reliable MEPs are difficult to elicit under normal anaesthesia. Using intravenous anaesthesia with either ketamine or etomidate infusion, we performed intraoperative MEP monitoring in 12 spinal operations for 11 cases from February 1992 to May 1992. For anaesthesia, ketamine was used in 5, etomidate in 7, fentanyl was supplemented in all, muscle relaxation at 30% to 50% of pre-anaesthetic muscle power was maintained with atracurium or vencuronium infusion. Transcranial bipolar electrical stimulation was used to induce MEPs. Concomitant SSEP monitoring was performed in 3. No significant anaesthesia related side effects were noted except one episode of unpleasant dream occurred in the ketamine anaesthesia group. Successful monitoring was achieved in 10 sessions. In 5 of which warning to the surgeons was made due to sudden MEP deterioration, which recovered followed by definite management in four and persisted in one. In the other 5 sessions, no warning was made due to stationary or gradual change in MEPs. Bilateral two-channel recordings were used in 3 sessions. In 2 of which unilateral transient change was noted. Loss of SSEPs was noted in one despite unchanged MEPs, in whom only new sensory deficits occurred postoperatively. Compared to the baseline MEPs in terms of latency and amplitude, the final MEPs improved in 5 sessions, did not change significantly in 4 sessions, deteriorated in one session, and were correlated well with the immediate postoperative motor status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "191-8"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Effects of occupational lead exposure on motor and somatosensory evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "7854606", "authors": ["Lille, F", "Margules, S", "Fournier, E", "Dally, S", "Garnier, R"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Neurotoxicology", "abstract": "In order to objectivate the effects of inorganic lead compounds on the nervous system, 17 men occupationally exposed have been recorded for Motor Electric Potentials (MEPs) of the abductor policis brevis muscles with transcranial, cervical root and peripheral electrical stimulations, for Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) of median and tibial posterior nerves, and for Electromyography (EMG). Considering each subject, 16 out of the 17 lead exposed ones exhibited electrophysiological abnormalities, occurring at both peripheral and central levels for the somatosensory as well as for the motor systems. As compared to a normal control group, the lead exposed one showed decreased sensory and motor peripheral conduction velocities, increased motor central conduction time, and delayed cortical P22 SEPs component that could be interpreted as a sensory-motor cortical dysfunction.

The first volley is termed the D wave, as it is assumed to be evoked by direct excitation of pyramidal tract neurons, whereas the subsequent I waves appear to be generated by indirect excitation of the pyramidal tract neurons via cortical interneurons. It was the aim of this study to obtain an estimate of the effect induced by multiple volleys evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation on the entire motoneuron pool of the tibialis anterior in awake subjects. A considerable part of a particular motoneuron pool was investigated by sampling responses of a large number (at least 19) from each muscle investigated. In total, three tibialis anterior muscles from three normal volunteers were studied. From each of the 63 units included in this study, a PSTH to 100 transcranial magnetic stimuli and a PSTH to 100 electrical stimuli given to the peroneal nerve were compiled. From the motor unit response to the peripheral nerve stimulation, the latency of the single-unit H reflex peak was obtained. This yielded, the timing of the subpeaks in response to the magnetic stimulation relative to the timing of the H reflex of the same unit, thus eliminating the influence of the peripheral conduction time from the motoneuron to the recording electrode. It was found that 50 (79%) of the motor units exhibited at least two subpeaks in response to the cortical stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "191-8"}, {"volume": "100", "title": "Cortical motor representation of the ipsilateral hand and arm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "7813640", "authors": ["Wassermann, EM", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In six normal subjects, we delivered ten stimuli each to a grid of sites 1 cm apart on the scalp. The EMG was recorded and averaged from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and risorius (facial) muscles at rest and the ipsilateral FDI muscle, which was voluntarily contracted. In four of these subjects and an additional subject, we used the same mapping technique and recorded from the deltoid muscle on the right and left sides and the contralateral FDI during activation of the ipsilateral deltoid. In all subjects, the cortical representation of the contralateral risorius was anterolateral to that of the FDI. The contralateral deltoid could be activated in only three subjects. In them, its representation was slightly medial to that of the FDI. All subjects had at least one scalp site where TMS produced MEPs in the ipsilateral FDI. Two subjects had rich ipsilateral hand representations with multiple ipsilateral MEP sites. Both had ipsilateral MEP sites near the representation of the contralateral FDI, but the largest ipsilateral MEPs occurred with TMS at more lateral sites, which were near the representation of the contralateral risorius. In these subjects, the ipsilateral deltoid was preferentially activated at sites medial and posterior to those activating the contralateral muscle. Ipsilateral TMS also produced silent periods in the FDI in all subjects. These silent periods were much more frequent than the ipsilateral MEPs and tended to occur with TMS near the representation of the contralateral FDI. The excitatory cortical representation of the ipsilateral arm muscles is accessible to TMS in normal subjects and is different from that of the homologous contralateral muscles. The hand may have two ipsilateral representations, one of which produces silent periods and the other MEPs at the same stimulus intensity.", "pages": "191-8"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "Increase of cerebral blood flow and improvement of brain motor control following spinal cord stimulation in ischemic spastic hemiparesis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-4", "pmid": "7631053", "authors": ["Visocchi, M", "Cioni, B", "Pentimalli, L", "Meglio, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "A 64-year-old man had an ischemic stroke in the left parietotemporal cortical-subcortical areas. He developed a severe right spastic hemiparesis and dysphasia. An angiographic study showed left internal carotid artery occlusion and right internal carotid artery stenosis. A right internal endoarteriectomy was performed without any clinical improvement. After 1 year the patient was a candidate for cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of his spastic hemiparesis. An epidural electrode (Medtronic Sigma 3483) was positioned at the cervical level, mediodorsal to the cord. Clinical and neurophysiological studies (surface polyelectromyography, PEMG, for evaluation of brain motor control) were performed before and after 7 days of SCS (0.2 ms, 80 c/s, intensity for paresthesiae, continuous mode). A transcranial Doppler (TCD) study of both middle cerebral arteries (MCA) at rest and during SCS was performed on two occasions. SCS was followed by improvement of voluntary movement, decrease of spasticity and better endurance. The clinical findings were confirmed by the PEMG recordings. TCD examination showed an increase of flow velocities on both the right MCA (+43%) and the left MCA (+130%) during SCS. Such a TCD pattern, suggesting an increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during SCS, was reproducible. This case confirms efficacy of SCS in the treatment of ischemic hemiparesis and the increase of CBF following cervical SCS in man. The marked increase of CBF, particularly evident on the ischemic side, may play a role in mediating the improvement of motor control in our patient together with a possible arousal of the so-called 'sleeping neurons' of the penumbra zone.", "pages": "191-8"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Identification of the cerebral motor cortex by focal magnetic stimulation: clinical application to neurosurgical patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-4", "pmid": "7624632", "authors": ["Asakura, T", "Tokimura, H", "Hirahara, K", "Baba, K"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "A figure-8 coil was designed that was capable of generating currents over a relatively limited area. In this study, we used the figure-8 coil to localize human cerebral motor cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation and assessed its value as a diagnostic tool for neurosurgical disease. The subjects were 10 normal volunteers and 12 neurosurgical patients. The points obtaining a response were plotted and the response area was delineated for each stimulus output. Rectangular coordinates were subsequently determined for the C3-Cz-C4 line with the stimulation sites set 1.0 cm apart. Then amplitude and latency maps were displayed by a computer wave map program. In normal volunteers, the posterior margin of the site where a threshold +5% stimulus obtained a response from the THE or ADM muscles almost coincided with the central sulcus. The optimal areas were relatively narrow on the amplitude and latency maps. In the patient with a left frontal convexity meningioma, the left threshold +5% area for the THE and ADM muscles showed marked anterolateral shift. No threshold map could be obtained on the affected side in patients with metastatic tumor and astrocytoma. Low perfusion areas caused by moyamoya disease and arteriovenous malformations produced narrowing of the optimal zone on the threshold map of the affected side. Hyperexcitability of the motor cortex was recognized in the arteriovenous malformation patients. Transcranial focal magnetic stimulation is a useful noninvasive diagnostic method for identification of the human cerebral motor cortex. It provides important information about changes in the localization and excitability of the motor cortex in neurosurgical patients and should be helpful for treatment planning.", "pages": "191-8"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Effect of the inhibitory phenomenon following magnetic stimulation of cortex on brainstem motor neuron excitability and on the cortical control of brainstem reflexes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "8232392", "authors": ["Leis, AA", "Kofler, M", "Stokic, DS", "Grubwieser, GJ", "Delapasse, JS"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "We studied the effect of the inhibitory phenomenon following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on brainstem motor neuron excitability and on the cortical control of brainstem reflexes in 5 normal subjects.

TMS effect on the cortical control of brainstem reflexes was assessed by delivery of a stimulus that was less than or equal to the threshold for the R1 with the subject relaxed, yet elicited a potentiated reflex during maneuvers requiring cortical input (i.e., voluntary eye-closure and anticipation, experiment 2). In experiment 1, a suprathreshold electric stimulus applied during post-TMS inhibition elicited an R1 response that was preserved in amplitude (mean 476 +/- 44 microV; 123%) compared to control responses not preceded by TMS (mean 386 +/- 31 microV). Conversely, in experiment 2, when the R1 was dependent on cortical drive, the mean R1 amplitude during post-TMS inhibition was only 15% (P < 0.01) and 8% (P < 0.01) of control values obtained during eye-closure and anticipation, respectively.

With the subject at rest or exerting 5% maximum voluntary contraction, 30 consecutive stimuli were given at 4 stimulus intensities (SIs) in 10% increments above resting motor threshold. Concurrent mental arithmetic constituted mental alertness. Spectral analysis was performed on data from 300 consecutive stimuli. The variability of MEP response size was inversely related to stimulus intensity, prestimulus voluntary muscle contraction, the recruitment of motoneurons and the size of the field generated by the magnetic coil. The MEP variability was larger than and not correlated with the variability of the H-reflex. Fast Fourier transformation and cross-correlation analysis did not identify a consistent dominant frequency, suggesting that the variability in MEP size is essentially random. We suggest that the variability in MEP response is caused by constant, rapid, spontaneous fluctuations in corticospinal and segmental motoneuron excitability levels. Any maneuver that raises this level or increases the probability of motoneuron firing will decrease MEP variability.", "pages": "191-8"}]
