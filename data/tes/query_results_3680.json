The TE stimulus is a 10 mu-ampere, 10 Hz, pulsed current transmitted via electrodes in the pinnae. Combinations of the following were given as intraperitoneal injections: 300 mg/kg p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) 48 hours before testing, 100 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) 30 min before testing and the saline vehicle for these drugs. Rats were tested prior to and 30 minutes after TE or sham TE. Testing for analgesia consisted of putting progressively increasing pressure on the rat tail 1/4 inch from the tip with a pneumatically driven, right angle wedge. The amount of pressure at which the rat moved its tail was measured both before and after TE, or sham TE, and recorded as the difference in tolerated peak pressure (DTPP). TE produced analgesia as manifested by a 613 percent increase in DTPP compared with sham TE treatment values. Among TE treated rats, pretreatment with pCPA decreased DTPP 91.5 percent compared with saline control values, indicating 5HT involvement. 5HTP restored TE induced analgesia in pCPA treated rats to the level of saline treated control animals, confirming 5HT involvement.", "pages": "175-81"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Serotonin involvement in analgesia induced by transcranial electrostimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "16", "pmid": "2140423", "authors": ["Warner, R", "Hudson-Howard, L", "Johnston, C", "Skolnick, M"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Life sciences", "abstract": "1. The response of the diaphragm to both transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical phrenic nerve stimulation was studied in thirteen normal subjects under conditions of either a 'reflex' drive to ventilation with inhaled CO2 or during volitional ventilation of similar magnitude. 2. The induced compound action potential in the diaphragm was recorded using an oesophageal electrode, and in some cases transdiaphragmatic pressure was recorded using oesophageal and gastric balloon catheters. 3. The response of the diaphragm to transcranial magnetic stimulation was invariably facilitated with volitional inspiration; there was either minimal or no response at functional residual capacity. 4. Facilitation with inspiration was also seen during a 'reflex' drive to ventilation with inhaled CO2 in the presumed absence of any volitional contribution to ventilation. A similar degree of facilitation was seen with voluntary ventilation of similar magnitude and pattern. 5. If the facilitation is predominantly a cortical phenomenon, then these results imply that there is a behavioural component in the previously supposed purely 'reflex' drive to ventilation with inhaled CO2. We also discuss the interpretation of these results if some of the facilitation occurs at the phrenic motoneurone.", "pages": "175-81"}, {"volume": "420", "title": "Putative cerebral cortical involvement in the ventilatory response to inhaled CO2 in conscious man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "2109059", "authors": ["Murphy, K", "Mier, A", "Adams, L", "Guz, A"], "year": "1990", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "The physiological characteristics of spinal cord responses recorded from the spinal epidural space of the cat to transcranial brain stimulation were studied, in comparison with the spinal cord responses to direct stimulation of the motor cortex or cerebellum. The conduction velocity of the initial wave of the responses to transcranial brain stimulation (122.3 +/- 16.3 m/sec mean +/- SD, n = 5) was much faster than the conduction velocity of the initial wave of the responses to motor cortex stimulation (68.3 +/- 14.7, n = 5) and similar to the conduction velocity of the initial wave of the responses to cerebellar stimulation (120.2 +/- 16.2, n = 5). Furthermore, the conduction velocity of any component in the subsequent polyphasic waves at any intensity was not similar to the conduction velocity of the initial wave of the responses to motor cortex stimulation. All components of the responses to motor cortex stimulation disappeared after intercollicular transection. In contrast, the initial wave of the responses to cerebellar stimulation and transcranial brain stimulation remained unaffected by intercollicular transection. The initial wave caused by anodal transcranial brain stimulation was eliminated by ablation of the cerebellum. However, cathodal transcranial brain stimulation sometimes can produce an initial wave that can be eliminated only by transection at the medullospinal junction. The initial wave of the responses to cerebellar stimulation was largest in amplitude when the vicinity of the dentate nucleus was stimulated. These results suggest that responses to activation of the cerebellum, rather than corticospinal neurons arising from the motor cortex, represent a major component of the spinal cord responses to transcranial brain stimulation in cats. The data obtained indicate that it is difficult to activate the motor cortex selectively by transcranial brain stimulation in cats.", "pages": "175-81"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Spinal cord responses to feline transcranial brain stimulation: evidence for involvement of cerebellar pathways.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16993895", "authors": ["Yamamoto, T", "Xing, JA", "Katayama, Y", "Tsubokawa, T", "Hirayama, T", "Maejima, S"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "abstract": "Sixty three patients with primary excessive myocardial infarction (MI) were examined.
