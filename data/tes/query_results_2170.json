We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate associated changes in corticospinal excitability both at rest and during voluntary facilitation at different levels of inspiratory effort. Diaphragm and abdominal motor thresholds were significantly lower in COPD than healthy controls, but the quadriceps response was the same. In patients there was a significant increase in diaphragm response from rest during 20% inspiratory efforts but no further increase with greater efforts. In controls there was a further stepwise increase at 40% and 60% of inspiratory effort. The cortical silent period was significantly shorter in COPD. Using paired stimulation to study intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits we found significantly less excitability of intracortical facilitatory circuits in patients at long (>7 ms) interstimulus intervals. These results suggest that there is a ceiling effect in motor control output to the respiratory muscles of patients with COPD.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "158", "title": "Effects of motor cortical stimulation on the excitability of contralateral motor and sensory cortices.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15232666", "authors": ["Mochizuki, H", "Terao, Y", "Okabe, S", "Furubayashi, T", "Arai, N", "Iwata, NK", "Hanajima, R", "Kamakura, K", "Motoyoshi, K", "Ugawa, Y"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The interstimulus intervals (ISIs) for MEP experiments were 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 400 ms, with those for SEP experiments being adjusted for the impulse conduction time from the wrist to the cortex. TMS over the right M1 reduced MEPs elicited by TMS of the left motor cortex at ISIs of 50-150 ms, whereas MEPs produced by TES were unaffected. TMS over M1 and vPM facilitated the contralateral cortical median nerve SEPs at an ISI of 100-200 ms, whereas it had no effect on tibial nerve SEPs or paired median nerve stimulation SEP. Based on these results, we conclude that at around 150-ms intervals, TMS over the motor areas (M1 and vPM) reduces the excitability of the contralateral motor area. This has a secondary effect of enhancing the responsiveness of the sensory cortex through cortico-cortical connections.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Stereotaxic rTMS for the treatment of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "15232304", "authors": ["Sch\u00f6nfeldt-Lecuona, C", "Gr\u00f6n, G", "Walter, H", "B\u00fcchler, N", "Wunderlich, A", "Spitzer, M", "Herwig, U"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia may be due to dysfunctional inner speech-related cortical areas. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been reported to be an effective treatment of hallucinations. In a cross-over sham controlled study, we guided rTMS stereotactically to inner speech-related cortical areas in hallucinating patients. These areas were identified individually prior to rTMS using fMRI in a subgroup of our patients. Active stimulation was applied over Broca's area and over the superior temporal gyrus as determined by fMRI, or according to structural images in the remaining patients. rTMS did not lead to a significant reduction of hallucination severity.

Increasing evidence suggests that the CMS is crucially important for skilled individuated finger movements. Little is known about to what extent the strength of the CMS differs between hand muscles. Here we measured CMS excitation to the first dorsal interosseus (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in healthy subjects by using a novel penta-stimulation technique (PST) and single motor unit (SMU) recordings. The PST is an extension of the triple-stimulation technique. It applies two additional supramaximal electrical stimuli at the wrist to the 'peripheral nerve of no interest' (in the case of the FDI and ADM the median nerve, in the case of the APB the ulnar nerve) to collide with the descending volleys in that nerve elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex and electrical stimulation of Erb's point. This eliminates volume conduction from neighbouring muscles innervated by the nerve of no interest and, therefore, allows accurate determination of the PST response. The PST response was significantly larger in the FDI compared with the ADM and APB. This was validated by the SMU recordings, which showed a higher estimated amplitude of the mean compound excitatory postsynaptic potential in spinal motoneurons of the FDI than in those of the APB and ADM. Finally, as a possible functional correlate, the maximum rate of repetitive voluntary finger movements was higher for index finger abduction (prime mover, FDI) than for little finger abduction (prime mover, ADM) and thumb abduction (prime mover, APB), and individual differences in maximum rate between the different movements correlated with individual differences in the corresponding PST responses. In conclusion, PST is a valuable novel method for accurate quantification of CMS excitation. The findings strongly suggest that CMS excitation differs between hand muscles and that these differences directly link to capability differences in individuated finger movements.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Changes in serial optical topography and TMS during task performance after constraint-induced movement therapy in stroke: a case study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15228805", "authors": ["Park, SW", "Butler, AJ", "Cavalheiro, V", "Alberts, JL", "Wolf, SL"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "The authors examined serial changes in optical topography in a stroke patient performing a functional task, as well as clinical and physiologic measures while undergoing constraint-induced therapy (CIT).

During the therapy, daily optical topography imaging using near-infrared light was measured serially while the participant performed a functional key-turning task. Clinical outcome measures included the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Motor Activity Log (MAL), and functional key grip test. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were also used to map cortical areas and hemodynamic brain responses, respectively. Optical topography measurement showed an overall decrease in oxy-hemoglobin concentration in both hemispheres as therapy progressed and the laterality index increased toward the contralateral hemisphere. An increased TMS motor map area was observed in the contralateral cortex following treatment. Posttreatment fMRI showed bilateral primary motor cortex activation, although slightly greater in the contralateral hemisphere, during affected hand movement. Clinical scores revealed marked improvement in functional activities. In one patient who suffered a stroke, 2 weeks of CIT led to improved function and cortical reorganization in the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Serum levels of carbamazepine and cortical excitability by magnetic brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10479785", "authors": ["Turazzini, M", "Manganotti, P", "Del Colle, R", "Silvestri, M", "Fiaschi, A"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We investigated the correlation between serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) and motor excitability studied by different parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in patients at the beginning of antiepileptic treatment.

Motor evoked potential (MEP) was recorded from the thenar eminence (TE) muscles of the unaffected arm. In all patients, we studied rest and active motor threshold (rMT, aMT), MEP amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP).

The recording sessions were performed before treatment and after 7, 15 and 60 days (SD=16 days). Serum level of CBZ were monitored at each recording session. We observed a progressive increase in rMT and aMT until the serum levels of CBZ reached a steady state condition. No significant changes were observed in MEP amplitude, CSP, ICI and ICF.

This was achieved by applying a single pulse of subthreshold (90% motor threshold) transcortical magnetic stimulation (subTMS) at the site of the motor cortex. Such a stimulus is able to activate intracortical inhibitory circuits and thereby depress motor cortical output. We hypothesized that it would also suppress a transcortical reflex loop. The stretch reflex was elicited using a pedal attached to an electric motor. SubTMS was applied at several intervals prior to M3. Recordings were repeated 20-40 times. The reflex components were quantified using 20-ms windows in the averaged rectified electromyogram (EMG). SubTMS evoked significantly larger depression of M3 than of the background EMG in the same time frame when applied 55-85 ms prior to M3 ( P<0.05, n=10). Furthermore, the effect on M3 was significantly larger than the effect on the spinal M2 ( P<0.01, n=7).

Here we evaluate the duration of the TMS-induced CSP following a single magnetic stimulus in a large homogeneous group of SCA2 patients compared with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (IDCA) patients with similar disease duration and severity, and in 20 healthy controls. The CSP duration in both arm and leg muscles was significantly (p<0.005) longer in patients than in controls. A significant positive correlation between disease duration and CSP prolongation in both SCA2 and IDCA was found. No correlation between age, onset and CSP duration emerged in either group. This study shows a prolongation of the TMS-induced silent period in both SCA2 and IDCA indicating that the cortical inhibitory mechanism is dependent on the disease duration and severity.

Mapping identifies functional neural structures, namely nerve roots, and monitoring provides continuous information on the functional integrity of motor and sensory pathways as well as reflex circuitry. Mapping is performed mostly by using direct electrical stimulation of a structure within the surgical field and recording at a distant site, usually a muscle. Sensory mapping can also be performed with peripheral stimulation and recording within the surgical site. Monitoring of the motor system is achieved with motor evoked potentials. These are evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation and recorded from limb muscles and the external anal sphincter. The presence or absence of muscle responses are the parameters monitored. Sensory potentials evoked by tibial or pudendal nerve stimulation and recorded from the dorsal columns via an epidurally inserted electrode and/or from the scalp as cortical responses are used to access the integrity of sensory pathways. Amplitudes and latencies of these responses are then interpreted. The bulbocavernosus reflex, with stimulation of the pudendal nerve and recording of muscle responses in the external anal sphincter, is used for continuous monitoring of the reflex circuitry. Presence or absence of this response is the pertinent parameter that is monitored.", "pages": "1-12"}]
