Although pilot trials have shown that tDCS yields promising results for major depressive disorder (MDD), its efficacy for bipolar depressive disorder (BDD), a condition with high prevalence and poor treatment outcomes, is unknown. In a previous study we explored the effectiveness of tDCS for MDD. Here, we expanded our research, recruiting patients with MDD and BDD. We enrolled 31 hospitalized patients (24 women) aged 30-70 years 17 with MDD and 14 with BDD (n = 14). All patients received stable drug regimens for at least two weeks before enrollment and drug dosages remained unchanged throughout the study. We applied tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (anodal electrode on the left and cathodal on the right) using a 2 mA-current for 20 min, twice-daily, for 5 consecutive days. Depression was measured at baseline, after 5 tDCS sessions, one week later, and one month after treatment onset. We used the scales of Beck (BDI) and Hamilton-21 items (HDRS). All patients tolerated treatment well without adverse effects. After the fifth tDCS session, depressive symptoms in both study groups diminished, and the beneficial effect persisted at one week and one month. In conclusion, our preliminary study suggests that tDCS is a promising treatment for patients with MDD and BDD.2.", "pages": "96-101"}, {"volume": "104", "title": "Contribution of the premotor cortex to consolidation of motor sequence learning in humans during sleep.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "20844115", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Jakoubkova, M", "Thirugnanasambandam, N", "Schmalfuss, L", "Hullemann, S", "Sonka, K", "Paulus, W", "Trenkwalder, C", "Happe, S"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Motor learning and memory consolidation require the contribution of different cortices. For motor sequence learning, the primary motor cortex is involved primarily in its acquisition. Premotor areas might be important for consolidation. In accordance, modulation of cortical excitability via transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) during learning affects performance when applied to the primary motor cortex, but not premotor cortex. We aimed to explore whether premotor tDCS influences task performance during motor memory consolidation. The impact of excitability-enhancing, -diminishing, or placebo premotor tDCS during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep on recall in the serial reaction time task (SRTT) was explored in healthy humans. The motor task was learned in the evening. Recall was performed immediately after tDCS or the following morning. In two separate control experiments, excitability-enhancing premotor tDCS was performed 4 h after task learning during daytime or immediately before conduction of a simple reaction time task. Excitability-enhancing tDCS performed during REM sleep increased recall of the learned movement sequences, when tested immediately after stimulation. REM density was enhanced by excitability-increasing tDCS and reduced by inhibitory tDCS, but did not correlate with task performance. In the control experiments, tDCS did not improve performance. We conclude that the premotor cortex is involved in motor memory consolidation during REM sleep.", "pages": "96-101"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "Corticospinal excitability during action observation in task-specific dystonia: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20837104", "authors": ["Fiorio, M", "Zhang, W", "Bresciani, MC", "Rodi, G", "Bertolasi, L", "Gambarin, M", "Tinazzi, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Observation of actions performed by other individuals activates the onlooker's motor system in a way similar to real movement execution. The functioning of this mechanism in the pathological domain is not clear yet. The aim of this study was to explore whether action observation activates the motor system of patients affected by a task-specific form of dystonia, such as writer's cramp. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the primary motor cortex and motor evoked potentials were recorded from hand (FDI and ADM) and forearm (FCR) muscles at baseline and during observation of actions (grasping and writing) or images. Writing actions could be performed with healthy or dystonic movement patterns. Results showed a highly specific and reversed pattern of activation in the FDI muscle of the two groups. Differences between the two writing conditions were significantly opposite in the two groups: control subjects had higher activation during observation of the dystonic compared to the healthy action, whereas in patients observation of the healthy writing led to higher activation than the dystonic writing. This opposite corticospinal modulation might be explained by a different self-attribution of the observed actions in the two groups.", "pages": "96-101"}, {"volume": "217", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation decreases convulsions and spatial memory deficits following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in immature rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20826186", "authors": ["Kamida, T", "Kong, S", "Eshima, N", "Abe, T", "Fujiki, M", "Kobayashi, H"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a recently available, noninvasive brain stimulation technique.
