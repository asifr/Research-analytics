The SP duration after TCCS is directly proportional to stimulus intensity. To determine the anatomic substrate and underlying physiological properties of the SP from TCCS, we (1) compared the SP from TCCS with the SP from cutaneous and mixed nerve stimulation, (2) studied the excitability cycle of spinal motor neurons in 3 double stimulus conditions: (a) after paired peripheral nerve stimulation, (b) after TCCS and peripheral nerve stimulation, and (c) after paired electrical TCCS, (3) investigated the timing of the excitability of the sensorimotor cortex measuring long latency responses from median nerve stimulation delivered inside the SP from TCCS. We found that after TCCS, spinal motor neuron segmental excitability is reduced for a period up to 100 msec. Inhibition at a suprasegmental, possibly cortical, level was even more prolonged for a period up to 160 msec, suggesting that at least the late part of the SP after TCCS is due to supraspinal inhibition. Determining the nature of the supraspinal inhibition such as the possible role of cortical inhibitory mechanisms may be useful in further understanding central mechanisms of voluntary motor control and sensorimotor processing.", "pages": "211-20"}, {"volume": "466", "title": "Silent period evoked by transcranial stimulation of the human cortex and cervicomedullary junction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "8410704", "authors": ["Inghilleri, M", "Berardelli, A", "Cruccu, G", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1993", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. The silent period evoked in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle after electrical and magnetic transcranial stimulation (TCS), electrical stimulation of the cervicomedullary junction and ulnar nerve stimulation was studied in ten healthy subjects. 2. With maximum-intensity shocks, the average duration of the silent period was 200 ms after electrical TCS, 300 ms after magnetic TCS, 43 ms after stimulation at the cervicomedullary junction and 100 ms after peripheral nerve stimulation. 3. The duration of the silent period, the amplitude of the motor-evoked potential, and the twitch force produced in the muscle were compared at increasing intensities of magnetic TCS. When the stimulus strength was increased from 30 to 70% of the stimulator output, the duration of the silent period lengthened as the amplitude of the motor potential and force of the muscle twitch increased. At 70 to 100% of the output, the amplitude of the motor potential and force of the muscle twitch saturated, whereas the duration of the silent period continued to increase. 4. Proximal arm muscle twitches induced by direct electrical stimulation of the biceps and extensor wrist muscles produced no inhibition of voluntary activity in the contracting FDI muscle. 5. The level of background activation had no effect on the duration of the silent period recorded in the FDI muscle after magnetic TCS. 6. Corticomotoneurone excitability after TCS was studied by means of a single magnetic conditioning shock and a test stimulus consisting either of one single magnetic shock or single and double electrical shocks (interstimulus interval 1.8 ms) in the relaxed muscle. A conditioning magnetic shock completely suppressed the response evoked by a second magnetic shock, reduced the size of the response evoked by a single electrical shock but did not affect the response evoked by double electrical shocks. Inhibition of the test magnetic shock was also present during muscle contraction. 7. Our findings indicate that the first 50 ms of the silent period after TCS are produced mainly by spinal mechanisms such as after-hyperpolarization and recurrent inhibition of the spinal motoneurones. If descending inhibitory fibres contribute, their contribution is small. Changes in proprioceptive input probably have a minor influence. From 50 ms onwards the silent period is produced mainly by cortical inhibitory mechanisms.", "pages": "211-20"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "The use of a cap-shaped coil for transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "14151407", "authors": ["Kraus, KH", "Gugino, LD", "Levy, WJ", "Cadwell, J", "Roth, BJ"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "A cap-shaped coil is introduced as a superior design for inducing transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials for spinal cord monitoring.

Twenty normal adults were stimulated with the cap coil and a 9-cm round coil in three positions. Compound muscle action potentials were recorded from the left and right abductor digiti minimi and anterior tibialis muscles. The cap coil induced potentials with higher intensities and lower variability between consecutive stimuli.

Both methods were able to elicit a reproducible blink reflex. In both groups the latencies of the magnetically elicited reflexes were equal to those that followed electrical stimulation. The magnetic stimulation technique offered 2 advantages over the electrical stimulation: (1) it was less painful and therefore better tolerated and (2) the coil position in the middle of the forehead was sufficient to elicit a bilateral blink reflex because the windings of the stimulation coil excited both supraorbital nerves simultaneously. This bilateral response enables one to reduce the number of stimuli and can be used in the examination of patients that have peripheral facial nerve palsies without the concomitant impairment of the reflex pathway in the brainstem. The magnetic technique can also elicit a blink reflex at stimulation points distant from the supraorbital notch.

In order to determine the level at which the early modulation of human motor outputs takes place, we recorded maximal H reflexes, peripheral M responses, motor evoked potentials to transcranial magnetic stimulation, and motor evoked potentials to transcranial electrical stimulation and spinal electrical stimulation from a muscle immediately proximal to a limb segment made ischaemic by a pneumatic tourniquet. The amplitudes of motor evoked potentials to transcranial magnetic stimulation, but not to transcranial electrical stimulation and spinal electrical stimulation, were larger during ischaemia, implying that the site of change was in the motor cortex. The maximal H/M ratios were unaffected by ischaemia, indicating that alpha-motor neuron excitability to segmental Ia inputs remained unchanged. The map of cortical representation areas for this muscle obtained with transcranial magnetic stimulation was also enlarged. Taken together, our findings suggest that the temporary removal by ischaemic nerve block of myelinated afferent inputs reduces inhibition at the motor cortical level and that this disinhibition is responsible for the increased excitability of the corticospinal system.", "pages": "211-20"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "The site of impulse generation in transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "1710974", "authors": ["Rimpil\u00e4inen, I", "Pyykk\u00f6, I", "Blomstedt, G", "Kuurne, T", "Karma, P"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Acta oto-laryngologica", "abstract": "The facial nerve can be stimulated in its intracranial course through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

Nevertheless, the usefulness of ABR is limited by the anatomic extent of the investigated pathways. The combined use of ABRs and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) improves the outcome prediction in comparison to the use of only one modality. It mainly decreases the rate of false negatives, since patients with severe hemispheric damage sparing the brain stem may have a poor outcome despite normal ABRs. The use of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from magnetic transcranial stimulation is also significantly related to outcome: it appears to be far superior to the clinical evaluation of motor responses, while the combined use of MEPs and SEPs gives a new opportunity of checking sensorimotor dysfunction. ABRs and SEPs may also be useful tools in the confirmation of brain death, the kernel of which is the assessment of brainstem death: they allow to check lemniscal pathways, which cannot be properly evaluated by clinical examination, and provide an objective confirmation of absence of brain stem activity.", "pages": "211-20"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Use of tramal during minor surgical interventions in children].", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "2022246", "authors": ["Ostre\u012dkov, IF", "Sen'kov, VN", "Kurilova, ES", "Bershinski\u012d, VP", "Pivovarov, SA", "Babaev, BD"], "year": "", "journal": "Anesteziologiia i reanimatologiia", "abstract": "Intraoperative analgesia was performed using a combination of tramal at a dose of 2-2.5 mg/kg and transcranial electrical stimulation under halothane-nitrous oxide-oxygen mask anesthesia.

Magnetic stimulation used a monophasic current pulse through a circular coil centred 3 cm anterior to the vertex. Lowest threshold magnetic stimulation occurred when the current in the coil flowed from the left to the right side at the posterior rim of the coil. Such stimulation produced single unit and surface EMG responses which had the same latency as those produced by anodal electric stimulation. If the direction of the magnetic stimulating current was reversed, response latencies became more variable from unit to unit, and on average they occurred 1.0 +/- 0.5 msec later. In single motor units anodal and magnetic post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) peaks had the same duration. This was similar to the duration of the PSTH peaks produced by a single low intensity stimulus given to the common peroneal nerve. We conclude that magnetic stimulation can produce direct activation of corticospinal neurones to the tibialis anterior if the direction of induced current flow is optimal.
