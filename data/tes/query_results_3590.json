Intraoperative recording was performed with transcranial electrical stimulation. Two groups of patients were studied: 1) a control population of 26 patients undergoing lumbar discectomy for prolapsed intervertebral disc, all of whom had normal preoperative motor conduction; and 2) a population of 8 patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures for spinal tumor (5 patients) and spinal arteriovenous malformation (3 patients), all of whom had abnormal preoperative neurological signs and abnormal preoperative motor conduction. In the first group, electromyographic responses were recorded intraoperatively either from the 2nd dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand (5 patients) or from the 1st dorsal interosseous muscle of the foot (21 patients). In the second group, responses were recorded intraoperatively either from the 1st dorsal interosseous muscle of the foot (7 patients) or from the anterior tibial muscle (1 patient). Intraoperative monitoring of motor function was successful in 88.5% of the patients in the control group. Propofol anesthesia caused a reduction in response amplitude to 7% of baseline values obtained from conscious relaxed subjects. Intraoperative monitoring was successful in 87% of the patients in the pathological group. We observed significant changes in both amplitude (greater than 50%) and/or onset latency (greater than 3 ms) from the intraoperative baseline that indicated either improvement (3 patients) or deterioration (2 patients) in motor conduction within minutes of surgical maneuvers anticipated to alter spinal cord function. Only permanent complete loss of intraoperative motor conduction (1 patient) correlated with a significant change in the postoperative neurological state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "551-7"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Estimate of motor conduction in human spinal cord: slowed conduction in spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "1944412", "authors": ["Chang, CW", "Lien, IN"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "By using motor evoked potential (MEP) created by transcranial electric stimulation over the motor cortex and F-wave measurement from the peripheral nerve stimulation, it is possible to estimate the spinal cord motor conduction velocity (SCMCV) in the diseased state.

In 16 patients with neurologically incomplete SCI, MEP was obtained in 13 patients. The SCMCV estimated from C7 to T12 spinal levels was 32.1 (SD = 9.4) m/s. This was significantly slower than 63.3 (SD = 8.6) m/s in 40 normal controls.

Reproducible tce-MERs were recordable from the tibialis anterior muscle during nitrous oxide/opioid anesthesia in 11 patients. Before the introduction of isoflurane, tce-MER onset latency was 30.8 +/- 1.9 ms, and amplitude ranged from 19 microV to 2.6 mV (median, 209 microV). Operating conditions necessitated neuromuscular blockade in three patients before administration of isoflurane. In the remaining eight patients, introduction of isoflurane in low concentrations resulted in an immediate increase in the latency and a decrease in the amplitude of tce-MERs. The tce-MERs were completely obliterated in all subjects at end-tidal isoflurane concentrations between 0.2% and 0.6% (median, 0.24%). After discontinuation of isoflurane, the tce-MER returned in all patients. The authors conclude that, during nitrous oxide/opioid anesthesia, with the stimulus and recording variables used, isoflurane even at very low concentrations precludes recording of tce-MERs.", "pages": "551-7"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Concurrent increases in brain electrical activity and intracranial blood flow velocity during low-dose ketamine anaesthesia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "1742815", "authors": ["Kochs, E", "Werner, C", "Hoffman, WE", "M\u00f6llenberg, O", "Schulte am Esch, J"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesth\u00e9sie", "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of low-dose ketamine on spontaneous brain electrical activity (EEG) and intracranial blood flow velocity. Twenty healthy volunteers were divided into two groups: Group I (n = 10) received 0.25 mg.kg-1 ketamine iv; Group II (n = 10) received 0.5 mg.kg-1 ketamine iv. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2), and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) were measured. The EEG was recorded from temporo-occipital recording sites over both hemispheres. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was measured using a transcranial Doppler ultrasound system. All variables were evaluated at baseline and for 60 min following ketamine. Administration of ketamine resulted in increases of MAP and HR in both groups to a similar degree. The PETCO2 and SaO2 did not change in either group over time. Ketamine caused a dose-dependent, transient shift in the EEG to synchronous high-voltage slow waves with an increase in total power (Group I: 301 +/- 38%; Group II: 104 +/- 28%). These changes were associated with dose-dependent increases in mean blood flow velocity (Group I: 35 +/- 7%; Group II: 68 +/- 10%). Our data suggest that increases in intracranial blood flow velocity are closely correlated to increases in neuronal activity and are not secondary to changes in systemic haemodynamic variables.", "pages": "551-7"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Electrical and magnetic transcranial stimulation in patients with corticospinal damage due to stroke or motor neurone disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1742812", "authors": ["Berardelli, A", "Inghilleri, M", "Cruccu, G", "Mercuri, B", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Twenty patients with hemiplegia and 13 patients with motor neurone disease were studied with electrical and magnetic transcranial stimulation.

The reason why magnetic stimulation reveals fewer abnormalities than electrical stimulation could be that magnetic stimulation repetitively discharges the pyramidal cells and, because of temporal summation mechanisms, produces more powerful excitatory potentials at the lower motoneurone synapse.", "pages": "551-7"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Transcranial stimulation of motor cortex in upper motor neurone syndrome: its relation to the motor deficit.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1718725", "authors": ["H\u00f6mberg, V", "Stephan, KM", "Netz, J"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to clarify the functional significance of the fastest cortico-motoneuronal connections in chronic upper motor neurone syndromes. Using magneto-electrical stimulation of motor cortex the intactness of cortico-motoneuronal connections was assessed in 51 patients presenting with variable degrees of impairment. There was a gross correlation between clinical impairment of the patient and the degree of pathology of cortico-motoneuronal efferents. Covariation of clinical data with transcranial stimulation was better than covariation with the size of lesion on CT scans. In some patients, however, definite clinical impairment, especially affecting distal fractionated movements, was associated with completely normal responses. There was no evidence of response abnormality in distal muscles ipsilateral to the hemispheric lesion. The data indicate that motor deficit can exist in the presence of normal cortico-motoneuronal conduction times, showing that intactness of these connections is not a sufficient condition for preservation of voluntary motor activities. This underlines the importance of other pathways for the pathogenesis of upper motor neurone syndromes.", "pages": "551-7"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Attenuation in detection of somatosensory stimuli by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1718724", "authors": ["Cohen, LG", "Bandinelli, S", "Sato, S", "Kufta, C", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Effects of magnetic stimulation (MS) of the scalp and direct cortical electrical stimulation on detection of an electrical stimulus to the index finger (S1) were studied in 7 normal volunteers and a patient with epilepsy. Detection of somatosensory stimuli was attenuated when MS was delivered 200 msec before S1, was blocked when MS was delivered simultaneously to and 20 msec after S1, and was fully recovered when MS was delivered 200 msec after S1. This effect showed topographic specificity, being produced by scalp stimulation of restricted scalp positions contralateral to the finger stimulated, was maximal with low intensities of finger stimulation and high intensities of MS (usually over that required for motor threshold), and could also be produced in the absence of motor evoked responses in a peripheral hand muscle. These results show that a focal cortical stimulus can briefly attenuate detection of somatosensory stimuli before, during, and after cortical arrival of a somatosensory afferent volley.

The extent of inhibition is related to the stimulus intensity as the silent period is more evident when stimulation is perceived as painful. The silent period is present in different limb and cranial muscles after stimulation of the same cutaneous nerve and in the same muscle after stimulation of distant cutaneous nerves. It also occurs synchronously in antagonist muscles. Within the silent period induced after cutaneous stimulation the maximal inhibition on the opponens pollicis motor neuron pool, as tested by the motor response evoked after transcranial cortical stimulation, occurs between 50 and 70 msec. Using the double stimulus technique to study the recovery cycle, the silent period is present at interstimulus intervals as low as 100 msec, and does not habituate with trains of stimuli at frequencies up to 5 Hz. Our results suggest that motor neuron inhibition from nociceptive stimulation may be mediated by Renshaw cells directly activated by high threshold cutaneous afferents.", "pages": "551-7"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Bilateral small-hand-muscle motor evoked responses in a patient with congenital mirror movements.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "1718720", "authors": ["van der Linden, C", "Bruggeman, R"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "In a 56 year old patient with congenital mirror movements involving the muscles of the hands and forearms, transcranial electrical stimulation of either the left or right motor-cortex hand area induced bilateral surface electromyographic (EMG) responses in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles with normal latencies (21 msec). Slight volitional background contraction of the APB muscle contralateral to the stimulated motor cortex enhanced the motor evoked potential (MEP) and shortened the latency of the response by about 3 msec, while no definite facilitation was detected in the ipsilateral APB muscle. Volitional activation of the APB muscle ipsilateral to the stimulated motor cortex failed to enhance the response or shorten the latency of the response in either APB muscle.
