TMS allows neurostimulation and neuromodulation, while tDCS is a purely neuromodulatory application. TMS and tDCS allow diagnostic and interventional neurophysiology applications, and focal neuropharmacology delivery. However, the physics and basic mechanisms of action remain incompletely explored. Following an overview of the history and current applications of noninvasive brain stimulation, we review stimulation device design principles, the electromagnetic and physical foundations of the techniques, and the current knowledge about the electrophysiologic basis of the effects. Finally, we discuss potential biomedical and electrical engineering developments that could lead to more effective stimulation devices, better suited for the specific applications.", "pages": "527-65"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Magnetic stimulation including the triple-stimulation technique in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17443663", "authors": ["Attarian, S", "Verschueren, A", "Pouget, J"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "To study the relative importance of upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction in the weakness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to compare the sensitivity of several transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) parameters as means of assessing UMN impairment in ALS, we used TMS to evaluate one upper limb of 63 patients. The triple-stimulation technique (TST) and silent period (SP) were found to be the most frequently abnormal parameters (55.6% and 47.6%, respectively), without significant difference in their diagnostic sensitivity. The SP was found to be a useful parameter in patients with suspected or possible ALS. A positive correlation was found between weakness and the TST amplitude ratio, indicating that weakness may partly be caused by UMN dysfunction. Thus, the TST provides a quantitative tool for assessing UMN conduction failure. When used in association with the SP, the TST provides a sensitive diagnostic tool for use on ALS patients.", "pages": "527-65"}, {"volume": "254", "title": "The amplitude of lower leg motor evoked potentials is a reliable measure when controlled for torque and motor task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "17431701", "authors": ["van Hedel, HJ", "Murer, C", "Dietz, V", "Curt, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes have the disadvantage of a high variability when repeatedly assessed.
