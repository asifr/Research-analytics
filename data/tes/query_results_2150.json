The stimulus voltage threshold is the voltage below which no motor response can be elicited. It has frequently been used as a monitoring parameter. However, its value can be limited, because it is affected by the impedance of the stimulus electrode. For example, the voltage threshold can change owing to formation of oedema of the scalp. The relationship between the TES voltage threshold and the electrode impedance of different electrode types was studied and discussed in the context of neuromonitoring: 323 impedance and voltage threshold pairs were studied, and TES was performed with disc cup EEG electrodes (six), corkscrew electrodes (type I: seven, type II: eight), multiple EEG needle electrodes (16) and a large needle electrode Cz' (anode) together with a ground strip over the forehead (cathode) (286). The study found the voltage threshold to be strongly dependent on electrode impedance when the impedance was higher than 460 omega (correlation: R2=0.87; p < 0.001). Below 460 omega, which included 91% of the category with the largest electrode surfaces, 25% of the multiple EEG electrodes and 75% of type II corkscrew electrodes, no significant correlation (R2=0.0064; p=0.15) was found. It was concluded that the correlation between the TES voltage threshold and electrode impedance can be markedly reduced by using TES electrodes with large contact surfaces, resulting in limit values for these parameters. This also may improve the reliability of TES motor evoked potential monitoring.", "pages": "557-61"}, {"volume": "158", "title": "Bilateral responses of upper limb muscles to transcranial magnetic stimulation in human subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15316706", "authors": ["Bawa, P", "Hamm, JD", "Dhillon, P", "Gross, PA"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The following study examined if a clear boundary exists between the distal and proximal upper limb muscles that are controlled contralaterally or bilaterally. The right motor cortical area representing the upper limb was stimulated, while surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from various upper limb muscles during rest and phasic voluntary contractions. Peak-to-peak amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) was measured for each muscle on both sides. The ratio R = (ipsilateral MEP: contralateral MEP) was calculated for seven pairs of muscles. For each of the seven pairs, R was less than 1.0, implying that for each muscle and subject, the contralateral control is stronger. The boundary where R changed from almost zero to a clearly measurable magnitude depended on the subject. Ipsilateral MEPs from trapezius and pectoralis could be recorded with a small background contraction from almost all subjects; on the other hand, in deltoid and biceps brachii, ipsilateral MEPs were observed only with bimanual phasic contractions. The forearm and hand muscles, in general, did not show any ipsilateral MEPs. Major differences between subjects lay in the presence or the absence of ipsilateral MEPs in biceps brachii and deltoid, without defining a sharp boundary between proximal and distal muscles.", "pages": "557-61"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Neurophysiologic monitoring and pharmacologic provocative testing for embolization of spinal cord arteriovenous malformations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "15313696", "authors": ["Niimi, Y", "Sala, F", "Deletis, V", "Setton, A", "de Camargo, AB", "Berenstein, A"], "year": "2004", "journal": "AJNR.

Magnetic stimulation was applied through an 8-shaped magnetic coil over primary motor and premotor cortex at a specific time point while executing the first of a three movement sequence. TMS applied to the premotor cortex showed an alteration effect on the first movement while stimulation of the primary motor cortex influenced the second movement in the sequence. Results suggest that the premotor cortex is involved in online monitoring and controlling of spatio-temporal features of trajectories while the motor cortex contributes to the execution of movements. Isochrony is maintained to a high degree under TMS which has been found in other studies to delay reaction times. The results show that although TMS has a significant influence on motor performance, isochrony is a robust component of motor programs, not readily to be disturbed.", "pages": "557-61"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Modulation of motor excitability during speech perception: the role of Broca's area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "15298785", "authors": ["Watkins, K", "Paus, T"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "In order to identify the precise location of the primary motor area for the diaphragm with respect to the classical motor homunculus, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were performed utilizing independent component-cross correlation- sequential epoch (ICS) analysis on a high-field (3.0 Tesla) system.

Distinct visual and motor processes have been dissociated in the FEF of macaque monkeys, but little is known about the visual processing capacity of FEF in humans. We used double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation [(d)TMS] to investigate the timing of target discrimination during visual conjunction search. We applied dual TMS pulses separated by 40 msec over the right FEF and vertex. These were applied in five timing conditions to sample separate time windows within the first 200 msec of visual processing. (d)TMS impaired search performance, reflected in reduced d' scores. This effect was limited to a time window between 40 and 80 msec after search array onset. These parameters correspond with single-cell activity in FEF that predicts monkeys' behavioral reports on hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection trials. Our findings demonstrate a crucial early role for human FEF in visual target discrimination that is independent of saccade programming.", "pages": "557-61"}]
