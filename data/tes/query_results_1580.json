To investigate whether manipulation of brain excitability by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; 1.5 mA, 10 min, 0.026 C/cm(2)) modulates neuromuscular fatigue, we evaluated the effect of brain polarization over the right motor areas of the cerebral cortex of healthy subjects on the endurance time for a submaximal isometric contraction of left elbow flexors. In 24 healthy volunteers the study protocol comprised an assessment of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for the left elbow flexors and a fatiguing isometric contraction (35% of MVC), before and immediately after brain polarization. One hour elapsed between baseline (T0) and postconditioning (T1) evaluation. After tDCS, MVC remained unchanged from baseline (mean +/- SEM; anodal tDCS: T0, 154.4 +/- 18.07; T1, 142.8 +/- 16.62 N; cathodal tDCS: T0, 156 +/- 18.75; T1, 141.86 +/- 17.53 N; controls: T0, 148.8 +/- 6.64; T1, 137.6 +/- 7.36 N; P > 0.1). Conversely, endurance time decreased significantly less after anodal than after cathodal tDCS or no stimulation (-21.1 +/- 5.5%, -35.7 +/- 3.3% and -39.3 +/- 3.3%, respectively; P < 0.05). None of the evaluated electromyographic variables changed after tDCS. Anodal tDCS could improve endurance time by directly modulating motor cortical excitability, modulating premotor areas, decreasing fatigue-related muscle pain, increasing motivation and improving synergist muscle coupling. Our findings, showing that anodal tDCS over the motor areas of the cerebral cortex improves muscle endurance, open the way to increasing muscle endurance and decreasing muscle fatigue in normal (i.e. sports medicine) and pathological conditions.", "pages": "242-9"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "The dual nature of time preparation: neural activation and suppression revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "17610596", "authors": ["Davranche, K", "Tandonnet, C", "Burle, B", "Meynier, C", "Vidal, F", "Hasbroucq, T"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMSs) of the motor cortex (M1) were performed in order to decipher the neural mechanisms of time preparation. We varied the degree to which it was possible to prepare for the response signal in a choice reaction time (RT) task by employing either a short (500 ms) or a long (2500 ms) foreperiod in separate blocks of trials. Transcranial magnetic stimulations were delivered during these foreperiods in order to study modulations in both the size of the motor evoked potential (MEP) and the duration of the silent period (SP) in tonically activated response agonists. Motor evoked potential area and silent period duration were assumed to reflect, respectively, the excitability of the cortico-spinal pathway and the recruitment of inhibitory cortical interneurons. Shorter reaction times were observed with the shorter foreperiod, indicating that a better level of preparation was attained for the short foreperiod. Silent period duration decreased as time elapsed during the foreperiod and this decrement was more pronounced for the short foreperiod. This result suggests that time preparation is accompanied by a removal of intracortical inhibition, resulting in an activation. Motor evoked potential area decreased over the course of the short foreperiod, but not over the long foreperiod, revealing that time preparation involves the inhibition of the cortico-spinal pathway. We propose that cortico-spinal inhibition secures the development of cortical activation, preventing erroneous premature responding.", "pages": "242-9"}, {"volume": "182", "title": "Assessing the neural correlates of self-enhancement bias: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17607566", "authors": ["Kwan, VS", "Barrios, V", "Ganis, G", "Gorman, J", "Lange, C", "Kumar, M", "Shepard, A", "Keenan, JP"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Recently we developed a stimulation paradigm, which evokes convergent afferent input from two hand muscles and induces reorganisation within human motor cortex. Here we investigated whether this reorganisation is characterised by expansion and greater overlap of muscle representation zones, as reported in animal models. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we mapped the motor representation of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in 24 healthy subjects before and after 1 h of (1) associative stimulation to FDI and ADM motor points, (2) associative stimulation to digits II and V (3) a control condition employing non-correlated stimulation of FDI and ADM motor points. Motor point associative stimulation induced a significant increase in the number of active sites in all three muscles and volume in FDI and ADM. Additionally, the centre of gravity of the FDI and ADM maps shifted closer together. Similar changes were not observed following digital associative stimulation or motor point non-associative stimulation.

We hypothesized that an increase in the activity in the motor cortex by cortical stimulation would increase its inhibitory influence on spinal excitability through the corticospinal tract and, thus, reduce the hyperactivity of the gamma and alpha neurons, improving spasticity. Seventeen participants (eight males, nine females; mean age 9y 1mo [SD 3y 2mo]) with cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia were randomized to receive sham, active 1Hz, or active 5Hz repetitive TMS of the primary motor cortex. Stimulation was applied for 5 consecutive days (90% of motor threshold). The results showed that there was a significant reduction of spasticity after 5Hz, but not sham or 1Hz, stimulation as indexed by the degree of passive movement; however this was not evident when using the Ashworth scale, although a trend for improvement was seen for elbow movement. The safety evaluation showed that stimulation with either 1Hz or 5Hz did not result in any adverse events as compared with sham stimulation.

Electrical activities of the muscles, induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation to the brain, i.e., motor evoked potentials (MEPs), are used for estimation of the excitability of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. It is well known that rotational positioning of the forearm influences MEPs of forearm muscles through modulation of excitability in the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated whether such a posture-dependent change of MEPs could be found in upper arm and intrinsic hand muscles at three different rotational forearm positions: the most internal (pronation), neutral, and most external (supination) positions of rotation. MEPs were simultaneously recorded from the four muscles, biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and abductor pollicis brevis (AbPB). MEP amplitudes and latencies in BB, TB and ADM were significantly larger and shorter, respectively, in supination compared to the values in other positions. By contrast, MEP of AbPB in supination was lower in amplitude and longer in latency. Importantly, muscle lengths of TB, ADM and AbPB are constant in any rotational forearm positions, excluding the possibility of the muscle-length dependent change of spinal reflex. Therefore, these results might be attributable to the posture-dependent modulation of the motor cortex activity for the upper limb. The motor cortex probably changes the control strategy for the upper limb muscles in accordance with the sensory input from the forearm.", "pages": "242-9"}]
