A corticospinal contribution to the compensatory response of the Sol is under debate. The present study assessed spinal, corticospinal, and cortical excitability at the peaks of short- (SLR), medium- (MLR), and long-latency responses (LLR) after posterior translation of the feet. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation were individually adjusted so that the peaks of either motor evoked potential (MEP) or H reflex coincided with peaks of SLR, MLR, and LLR, respectively. The influence of specific, presumably direct, corticospinal pathways was investigated by H-reflex conditioning. When TMS was triggered so that the MEP arrived in the Sol at the same time as the peaks of SLR and MLR, EMG remained unaffected. Enhanced EMG was observed when the MEP coincided with the LLR peak (P < 0.001). Similarly, conditioning of the H reflex by subthreshold TMS facilitated H reflexes only at LLR (P < 0.001). The earliest facilitation after perturbation occurred after 86 ms. The TMS-induced H-reflex facilitation at LLR suggests that increased cortical excitability contributes to the augmentation of the LLR peaks. This provides evidence that the LLR in the Sol muscle is at least partly transcortical, involving direct corticospinal pathways. Additionally, these results demonstrate that approximately 86 ms after perturbation, postural compensatory responses are cortically mediated.", "pages": "420-9"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Motor and occipital cortex excitability in migraine patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16583724", "authors": ["Gunaydin, S", "Soysal, A", "Atay, T", "Arpaci, B"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Here we aimed to study the effects of another, very safe technique of non-invasive brain stimulation--transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)--on pain control in patients with central pain due to traumatic spinal cord injury. Patients were randomized to receive sham or active motor tDCS (2mA, 20 min for 5 consecutive days). A blinded evaluator rated the pain using the visual analogue scale for pain, Clinician Global Impression and Patient Global Assessment. Safety was assessed with a neuropsychological battery and confounders with the evaluation of depression and anxiety changes. There was a significant pain improvement after active anodal stimulation of the motor cortex, but not after sham stimulation. These results were not confounded by depression or anxiety changes. Furthermore, cognitive performance was not significantly changed throughout the trial in both treatment groups. The results of our study suggest that this new approach of cortical stimulation can be effective to control pain in patients with spinal cord lesion. We discuss potential mechanisms for pain amelioration after tDCS, such as a secondary modulation of thalamic nuclei activity.", "pages": "420-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Transcranial fluorescence imaging of auditory cortical plasticity regulated by acoustic environments in mice.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "16564623", "authors": ["Takahashi, K", "Hishida, R", "Kubota, Y", "Kudoh, M", "Takahashi, S", "Shibuki, K"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Functional stimulation is accompanied by increases in regional cerebral blood flow which exceed metabolic demands under normal circumstances, but it is unknown whether functional stimulation is beneficial or detrimental in the setting of acute ischemia.
