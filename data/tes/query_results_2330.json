Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used in 12 right-handed volunteers to study brain activity during motor imagery and execution of simple and complex unimanual finger movements of the dominant and the nondominant hand. In the simple task, a flexible object was rhythmically compressed between thumb, index and middle finger. The complex task was a sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movement. Premotor, posterior parietal and cerebellar regions were significantly more active during motor imagery of complex movements than during mental rehearsal of the simple task. In 10 of the subjects, we also used transcranial magnetic brain stimulation to examine corticospinal excitability during the same motor imagery tasks. Motor-evoked potentials increased significantly over values obtained in a reference condition (visual imagery) during imagery of the complex, but not of the simple movement. Imagery of finger movements of either hand activated left dorsal and ventral premotor areas and the supplementary motor cortex regardless of task complexity. The effector-independent activation of left premotor areas was particularly evident in the simple motor imagery task and suggests a left hemispherical dominance for kinesthetic movement representations in right-handed subjects.", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Information for assistants of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14685956", "authors": ["Pridmore, S", "Khan, U", "Rosa, MA", "George, MS"], "year": "2003", "journal": "International journal of mental health nursing", "abstract": "Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an exciting new technology being used in psychiatric and neurological research in many centres around the world. rTMS has been accepted as a routine treatment of depression in Canada and Israel.

As knowledge and experience grows, it is probable that professionals with other backgrounds will have the opportunity to play a role. The aim of this paper is to provide information that will be valuable to assistants. Electromagnetic principles are harnessed to deliver electric currents to localized regions of the cortex. rTMS does not involve anaesthesia or seizure. Side-effects appear to be few. Much remains uncertain, however, even including the most appropriate treatment parameters.", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "156", "title": "Human corticospinal excitability during a precued reaction time paradigm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14685810", "authors": ["McMillan, S", "Nougier, V", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Ten healthy, right-handed subjects performed a four-choice RT task that involved flexion and extension of dominant wrist. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was presented at random intervals over a period of 120 ms prior to the subject's average non-stimulated voluntary electromyography (EMG) activity onset. We found that there was a significant relationship between motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and TMS onset when both the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) acted as an agonist. This relationship could be explained using the sigmoidal Boltzmann equation. The slope for the relationship did not differ between the Full and Direction conditions, suggesting that corticospinal excitability is not altered in the specification of movement extent. Both these conditions differed significantly from the None condition. The modulation of corticospinal excitability appeared greater in the FCR than in the ECR. There was a significant delay in RT the closer in time TMS was presented with respect to EMG onset. During extension, there was no difference in slope between the three conditions, whereas during flexion the slope was greater in the None condition than in the Direction condition, which was in turn greater than in the Full condition. This was mirrored in the relationship between agonist MEP amplitude and TMS onset for both muscles. It is possible that the gain of the corticospinal tract is increased in the conditions in which less information is provided in the precue to partly compensate for the increase in RT, which comes as a result of the additional processing required in those conditions.", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "156", "title": "Modulation of interhemispheric inhibition during passive movement of the upper limb reflects changes in motor cortical excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14685808", "authors": ["Warbrooke, SA", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In the first experiment, eight healthy volunteers pre-activated their left flexor carpi radialis (FCR) in a simple isometric contraction (2.5-7.5% MVC) while their right hand underwent passive wrist flexion-extension. Transcranial magnetic (TMS) or electrical (TES) stimulation was applied to the right motor cortex and responses recorded from the test (left) limb in eight phases of the wrist flexion-extension cycle of the passively driven right limb. In half of the trials TMS conditioning was applied to the left motor cortex. The conditioning stimulus significantly inhibited TMS-evoked responses in the test FCR muscle, whereas TES-evoked responses did not appear to be inhibited. For TMS-evoked responses only, inhibition in the static pre-activated left FCR was modulated such that inhibition was greater when the right wrist was passively flexing than when it was extending. In the second experiment TMS was applied to the right motor cortex, contralateral to the test (left) limb, with the right hand either passively extending or flexing through the neutral position. Conditioning was applied to the left motor cortex at a range of intensities adjusted to threshold for flexion and extension movements. No difference was evident in the maximum magnitude of inhibition between the extension and flexion conditions. We propose there is an increased absolute threshold for recruitment and a decreased gain of inhibitory callosal pathways during extension phases of the wrist flexion-extension cycle.", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Transcranial magnetic brain stimulation and the cerebellum.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677420", "authors": ["Wessel, K"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Can epilepsies be improved by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation?--interim analysis of a controlled study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677417", "authors": ["Tergau, F", "Neumann, D", "Rosenow, F", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Steinhoff, B"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in brainstem lesions and lesions of the cranial nerves.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677411", "authors": ["Urban, PP"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on slow cortical potentials (SCP).", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677410", "authors": ["Karim, AA", "Kammer, T", "Lotze, M", "Hinterberger, T", "Godde, B", "Cohen, L", "Birbaumer, N"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation of the visual cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677406", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "3375-87"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Pharmacology of transcranial direct current stimulation: missing effect of riluzole.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677405", "authors": ["Liebetanz, D", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "3375-87"}]
