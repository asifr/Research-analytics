Output is typically calibrated to individual motor cortex excitability and applied to nonmotor brain areas, assuming that it captures a site nonspecific factor of excitability. We tested this assumption by correlating the effect of TMS at motor and visual cortex. In 30 participants, we measured motor threshold (MT) and phosphene threshold (PT) at the scalp surface and at coil-scalp distances of 3.17, 5.63, and 9.03 mm. We also modeled the effect of TMS in a simple head model to test the effect of distance. Four independent tests confirmed a significant correlation between PT and MT. We also found similar effects of distance in motor and visual areas, which did not correlate across participants. Computational modeling suggests that the relationship between the effect of distance and the induced electric field is effectively linear within the range of distances that have been explored empirically. We conclude that MT-guided calibration is valid for nonmotor brain areas if coil-cortex distance is taken into account. For standard figure-of-eight TMS coils connected to biphasic stimulators, the effect of cortical distance should be adjusted using a general correction factor of 2.7% stimulator output per millimeter.", "pages": "195-201"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Brain-machine interfaces and transcranial stimulation: future implications for directing functional movement and improving function after spinal injury in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23098729", "authors": ["Carmena, JM", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "We review the latest evidence for the neural underpinnings of hand motor function recovery after stroke with particular emphasis on how the latter can be enhanced by noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).", "pages": "195-201"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Clinical neurophysiology in the prognosis and monitoring of traumatic spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23098706", "authors": ["Curt, A", "Ellaway, PH"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "New data from longitudinal studies in which rTMS of the lesioned or contralesional motor cortex was combined with motor training showed ambiguous effects: some patients improved whereas others did not show any rTMS effect (compared with control stimulation).

We compared elbow flexor fatigue of young (n=10, 20.8\u00b12.7 years) and old men (n=16, 73.8\u00b16.1 years) during and in recovery from a dynamic and an isometric postural fatiguing task. Each task was maintained until failure while supporting a load equivalent to 20% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess supraspinal fatigue (superimposed twitch, SIT) and muscle relaxation. Time to failure was longer for the old men than for the young men for the isometric task (9.5\u00b13.1 vs. 17.2\u00b17.0 min, P=0.01) but similar for the dynamic task (6.3\u00b12.4 min vs. 6.0\u00b12.0 min, P=0.73). Initial peak rate of relaxation was slower for the old men than for the young men, and was associated with a longer time to failure for both tasks (P<0.05). Low initial power during elbow flexion was associated with the greatest difference (reduction) in time to failure between the isometric task and the dynamic task (r=-0.54, P=0.015). SIT declined after both fatigue tasks similarly with age, although the recovery of SIT was associated with MVIC recovery for the old (both sessions) but not for the young men. Biceps brachii and brachioradialis EMG activity (% MVIC) of the old men were greater than that of the young men during the dynamic fatiguing task (P<0.05), but were similar during the isometric task. Muscular mechanisms and greater relative muscle activity (EMG activity) explain the greater fatigue during the dynamic task for the old men compared with the young men in the elbow flexor muscles. Recovery of MVC torque however relies more on the recovery of supraspinal fatigue among the old men than among the young men.", "pages": "195-201"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Interaction between simultaneously applied neuromodulatory interventions in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20435146", "authors": ["Schabrun, SM", "Chipchase, LS", "Zipf, N", "Thickbroom, GW", "Hodges, PW"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activation during transcranial electrical stimulation is used to provide insight into the mechanisms of neuromodulation and targeting of particular brain structures. However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp. The direction of change relative to non-stimulation reversed with tDCS stimulation polarity. For tACS there was no net effect of the MRI signal. High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation. The optimization of current measurement and artifact correction techniques, including consideration of the underlying physics, remains to be addressed.", "pages": "195-201"}]
