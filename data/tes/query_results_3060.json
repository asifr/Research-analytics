Resting and active thresholds for TMS were significantly reduced in AD patients compared to young and aged healthy subjects. The maximum amplitude of the motor response evoked by TMS was also significantly increased in AD patients. We have tested if these changes are related to a modification of the short-lasting intracortical inhibition of the motor cortex by paired conditioning-test TMS. We found no significant differences between AD patients and aged healthy subjects even if there is a slight but significant difference between aged and young normal subjects. We conclude that the modification of excitability of the motor cortex does not result from an impaired intracortical inhibition.", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Development of spinal cord ischemia after clamping of noncritical segmental arteries in the pig.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10543493", "authors": ["de Haan, P", "Kalkman, CJ", "Meylaerts, SA", "Lips, J", "Jacobs, MJ"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "abstract": "Blood flow to the thoracolumbar spinal cord is thought to be critically dependent on the arteria radicularis magna.

Before, during, and after clamping of the noncritical segmental arteries, spinal cord ischemia was produced by decreasing SCPP by means of increasing CSF pressure, and the SCPP threshold at which tc-MEPs showed evidence of spinal cord ischemia was determined. Ischemic SCPP thresholds, obtained during and after clamping of the noncritical segmental arteries, were compared with the ischemic threshold obtained before clamping (control value).", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "128", "title": "Mechanism of the silent period following transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Simultaneously with the recording of the single motor-unit discharges, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and H-reflexes evoked by the two types of stimulation were recorded by surface electrodes and expressed as a percentage of the maximal motor response (Mmax). Ten motor units were activated in the H-reflex when it was less than 5% of Mmax, but not in the MEP even when it was 15% of Mmax. The opposite was observed for three motor units. Eleven motor units were recruited by both stimuli, but with significantly different recruitment thresholds. Only ten motor units had a threshold similar to TMS and radial nerve stimulation. From these observations, we suggest that caution should be taken when making conclusions regarding motor cortical excitability based on changes in the size of MEPs, even when it is ensured that there are no similar changes in background EMG-activity or H-reflexes.", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "The physiological basis of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10533113", "authors": ["Cracco, JB", "Cracco, RQ"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology.

Single suprathreshold test stimuli and paired stimuli at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 50-200 ms were delivered while the subject maintained a constant background contraction. The silent period duration from a single test stimulus was 357+/-62 ms. The test motor-evoked potentials were markedly reduced at all the ISIs tested. The I (indirect) waves induced by the test stimulus were largely unchanged at an ISI of 50 ms, suggesting that there was little change in motor cortex excitability. However, the corticospinal volleys, especially the late I waves, were substantially reduced at ISIs of 100 ms, 150 ms, and 200 ms.
