Therefore, they might need other strategies to modulate their pain, according to their level of disability. Neuromodulation can be achieved with several tools: meditation, biofeedback, physical therapy, drugs and electric neurostimulation (ENS). ENS can be applied to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), either invasively (cortical or deep brain) or non-invasively [cranial electrotherapy stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation]. Among chronic primary headaches, cluster headaches are most often treated either through deep brain stimulation or occipital nerve stimulation because there is a high level of disability related to this condition. ENS, employed through several modalities such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, interferential currents and pulsed radiofrequency, has been applied to the peripheral nervous system at several sites. We briefly review the indications for the use of peripheral ENS at the site of the occipital nerves for the treatment of chronic migraine.", "pages": "S29-31"}, {"volume": "153", "title": "Noninvasive cortical modulation of experimental pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "22633979", "authors": ["Mylius, V", "Borckardt, JJ", "Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "Noninvasive cortical stimulation (NICS) can produce analgesic effects by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Such effects have been demonstrated on chronic ongoing pain, as in acute provoked pain. The investigation of induced changes in the perception of experimental pain by NICS could help clinicians and researchers to better understand the mechanisms of action involved with these techniques and the role played by the cortex in the integration of nociceptive information. This review presents current literature data on the modulation of experimental pain perception by cortical stimulation. The observations found that NICS analgesic effects depend on the method used to provoke pain (referring to the type of nerve fibers and neural circuits that are recruited to mediate pain) and the parameters of cortical stimulation (especially the nature of the cortical target). The motor cortex (precentral cortical area) is the most widely used target for pain modulation. However, other targets, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, could be of particular interest to modulate various components of pain. Further developments in NICS techniques, such as image-guided navigated brain stimulation, might lead to improvement in the beneficial effects of NICS on pain. Finally, we discuss whether the results obtained in experimental pain can be transposed to the problem of chronic pain and whether they can be used to optimize cortical stimulation therapy for pain disorders.", "pages": "S29-31"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "Modulation of soleus H reflex by spinal DC stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22623482", "authors": ["Lamy, JC", "Ho, C", "Badel, A", "Arrigo, RT", "Boakye, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex induces changes in excitability within cortical and spinal circuits that occur during and after the stimulation. Recently, transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) has been shown to modulate spinal conduction properties, as assessed by somatosensory-evoked potentials, and transynaptic properties of the spinal neurons, as tested by postactivation depression of the H reflex or by the RIII nociceptive component of the flexion reflex in the lower limb. To further explore tsDCS-induced plastic changes in spinal excitability, we examined, in a double-blind crossover randomized study, the stimulus-response curves of the soleus H reflex before, during, at current offset and 15 min after anodal, cathodal, and sham tsDCS delivered at the Th11 level (2.5 mA, 15 min, 0.071 mA/cm(2), 0.064 C/cm(2)) in 17 healthy subjects. Anodal tsDCS induced a progressive leftward shift of the recruitment curve of the soleus H reflex during the stimulation; the effects persisted for at least 15 min after current offset. In contrast, both cathodal and sham tsDCS had no significant effects. This exploratory study provides further evidence for the use of tsDCS as an expedient, noninvasive tool to induce long-lasting plastic changes in spinal circuitry. Increased spinal excitability after anodal tsDCS may have potential for spinal neuromodulation in patients with central nervous system lesions.", "pages": "S29-31"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "Representation of cricothyroid muscles at the primary motor cortex (M1) in healthy subjects, mapped by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "22621909", "authors": ["Espadaler, J", "Rogi\u0107, M", "Deletis, V", "Leon, A", "Quijada, C", "Conesa, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To establish a methodology for mapping of primary motor cortex (M1) for cricothyroid (CTHY) muscles in a group of healthy subjects using three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS).", "pages": "S29-31"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Modulation of training by single-session transcranial direct current stimulation to the intact motor cortex enhances motor skill acquisition of the paretic hand.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "22618381", "authors": ["Zimerman, M", "Heise, KF", "Hoppe, J", "Cohen, LG", "Gerloff, C", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Two independent measurements were performed.
