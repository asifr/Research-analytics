In the clinical setting the technique is mainly used for the investigation of the corticospinal tract (motor evoked potential: MEP). Based upon our experience with patients examined over the course of four years, we have attempted to highlight the clinical situations, where diagnostic help is provided by this technique. MEP in general has proved to be a sensitive and reliable examination. Its significance is apparent mainly in situations where clinical signs of corticospinal tract dysfunction are not evident, or they are masked by lower motoneurone involvement, and where neuroimaging techniques are not informative. The demonstration of subclinical corticospinal lesion is often essential to establish the diagnosis in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The technique however received little attention so far with respect to its role in the diagnosis of various spinal cord disorders, and in the demonstration of intact corticospinal function in case of weakness, psychogenic in origin. We have endeavored to provide further evidence in support of this, and thereby advocating a wider clinical application of the technique.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Perceptual and response bias in visuospatial neglect due to frontal and parietal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "18", "pmid": "12499870", "authors": ["Brighina, F", "Bisiach, E", "Piazza, A", "Oliveri, M", "La Bua, V", "Daniele, O", "Fierro, B"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Recently some authors have challenged the conventional association of directional motor neglect with damage of frontal structures, showing that pure sensory perceptual neglect (classically associated with parietal lesion) can follow damage of right frontal cortex. The aim of the present study was to assess the type of defect in visuo-spatial attention consequent upon a virtual frontal or parietal lesion induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation in normal subjects. To this purpose eleven subjects performed a visuo-spatial task requiring judgement about the length of the two segments of asymmetrically bisected horizontal lines, presented for 50 ms on a computer monitor. After each visual stimulus, subjects made a binary forced choice decision according to two different response conditions: A and B. In condition A, they had to name (right or left) the longer segment and in B the shorter segment of the line. The task was given in baseline condition and during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Trains of 10 stimuli at 25 Hz of frequency were applied over right frontal premotor and right posterior parietal areas, synchronously with visual stimuli. Parietal and frontal magnetic stimulation gave rise to significant perceptual bias as compared to baseline performance (i.e. subjects made opposite errors in the two response conditions). No significant response bias (i.e. the tendency to name the same side of the line in the two response conditions) was induced by magnetic stimulation on parietal and frontal sites. The present study highlights both the relevant contribution of frontal cortex in the determinism of neglect and the predominant role of sensory perceptual factors in parietal and frontal neglect.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation induces increases in extracellular levels of dopamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens.", "keywords": [], "issue": "18", "pmid": "12499837", "authors": ["Zangen, A", "Hyodo, K"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive approach used for stimulating the human brain. Repetitive stimulation over the prefrontal cortex has proven effective in the treatment of major depression, however the mechanism of the antidepressant action is unknown. Since the nucleus accumbens is a major region implicated in reward circuitry and depressive disorders, we used the microdialysis technique to study some of the neurochemical changes induced in that region during and after acute TMS. Magnetic stimulation was applied over the frontal or the caudal cortex of the rat brain using a special coil design and microdialysis samples were collected before, during and after the stimulation session. The extracellular levels of both dopamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens were increased during the stimulation while the extracellular levels of acetylcholine were not affected. Stimulation over the caudal cortex caused a greater increase in dopamine levels than the stimulation over the frontal cortex, while such difference was not observed for glutamate levels. The changes in dopamine and glutamate extracellular levels in the nucleus accumbens may play a role in the antidepressant effect of TMS and it is therefore suggested that the effect of stimulation over caudal cortical sites on depressive patients will be examined.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Are the neurophysiological techniques useful for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS)?", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12495775", "authors": ["Miscio, G", "Guastamacchia, G", "Priano, L", "Baudo, S", "Mauro, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To characterize cortico-diaphragmatic pathway involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and verify its clinical impact.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Modulation of excitability of human motor cortex (M1) by 1 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral M1.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12495773", "authors": ["Schambra, HM", "Sawaki, L", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "TMS from diaphragm (Dia), and abductor digiti minimi (AbdV degrees ) was performed in 26 MS patients.
