Nineteen young healthy volunteers were included; during the study, all subjects were at rest, sitting on a comfortable armchair. The muscular activation was evaluated by continuous electromyographic record. TMS was performed by using a circular coil at the vertex. Resting motor threshold (rMT) was defined as the lowest TMS intensity able to induce motor responses of an amplitude >50 microV in the relaxed contralateral target muscle in approximately 50% of 20 consecutive stimuli. Venous blood lactate values were measured before, immediately after and 10 min after a single session of low frequencies (1Hz for 15 min) rTMS (LF rTMS) or high frequency (20 Hz for 15 min) rTMS (HF rTMS). As expected, LF rTMS induced a decrease of motor cortex excitability, whereas HF rTMS evoked an increase of motor cortex excitability. However, in the present investigation we observed that both conditions are associated to a significant increase of blood lactate. Since in our experimental conditions we can exclude a muscular production of lactate, the significant increment of peripheral blood lactate values, observed 10 min after the end of the rTMS session, is probably due to the crossing by brain-produced lactate of the blood-brain barrier.", "pages": "e6-7"}, {"volume": "80", "title": "Intraoperative preservation of corticospinal function in the brainstem.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "19074927", "authors": ["Neuloh, G", "Bogucki, J", "Schramm, J"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The corticospinal tract features a largely exposed course through the brainstem, and is therefore at risk in many brainstem-related procedures.

We used high-density electroencephalography during grasping to determine the relative timing of these two areas and to test whether the temporal contribution of each site would change when the task goal was perturbed. During object grasping with the right-hand, two distinct evoked responses were present over the 50-100 and 100-200 ms periods after movement onset. Distributed linear source estimation of these scalp potentials localized left lateralized sources, first in the aIPS and then the SPL. The duration of the response from the aIPS area was longer when there was an object perturbation. Initiation of a corrective movement coincided with activation in SPL.
