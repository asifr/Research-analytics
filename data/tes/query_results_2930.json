We have now examined whether muscle vibration (MV) can compensate for this depression. We enrolled 25 healthy volunteers (aged 22 to 37 years) who received 5 HZ, 10% subthreshold prefrontal rTMS for 12 s. The extensor carpi radialis muscle was vibrated with an electromagnetic mechanical stimulator with a stimulation frequency of 120 HZ and 0.5 mm amplitude. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the flexor carpi radialis muscle (FCR) following single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded at baseline, and after 4, 8, and 12 s. During prefrontal rTMS, MEPs of the FCR exhibited a serial depression (P = 0.001). This effect did not occur during MV. We conclude that rTMS of the prefrontal cortex may inhibit the corticospinal system. This depression may be compensated by MV, suggesting that vibration changes motor cortex excitability. The underlying mechanism might be an input from Ia sensory afferents to the motor and prefrontal cortex.", "pages": "112-5"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation and human muscle fatigue.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11150962", "authors": ["Taylor, JL", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "During exercise, changes occur at many sites in the motor pathway, including the muscle fiber, motoneuron, motor cortex, and \"upstream\" of the motor cortex. Some of the changes result in fatigue, which can be defined as a decrease in ability to produce maximal muscle force voluntarily. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the human motor cortex reveals changes in both motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the silent period during and after fatiguing voluntary contractions in normal subjects. The relationship of these changes to loss of force or fatigue is unclear. However, during a sustained maximal contraction TMS evokes extra force from the muscle and thus demonstrates the development of suboptimal output from the motor cortex, that is, fatigue at a supraspinal level. In some patients with symptoms of fatigue, the response to TMS after exercise is altered, but the changed MEP behavior is not yet linked to particular symptoms or pathology.", "pages": "112-5"}, {"volume": "135", "title": "Riluzole suppresses motor cortex facilitation in correlation to its plasma level.

Nine healthy volunteers received a dose of 100 mg riluzole from day 1 to 7 of the study period. Electrophysiological examinations were performed on day 1 before and 2 h, 5 h and 8 h after riluzole administration, on day 2, day 3 and day 5 before riluzole administration, and on day 8. Plasma samples were taken simultaneously. The excitability of the motor cortex, supraspinal and spinal motor pathways was tested by studying intracortical facilitation and inhibition, the cortical silent period and motor threshold after TMS, as well as the peripheral silent period and F-wave amplitudes after electrical peripheral nerve stimulation. We found a significant reduction of intracortical facilitation, which correlated significantly with riluzole plasma levels. To a lesser extent, intracortical inhibition was enhanced on day 1, motor threshold was increased on day 8 and F-wave amplitudes were reduced. These changes did not correlate with riluzole plasma levels. We conclude that the main effect of riluzole in vivo is a reduction of intracortical facilitation, which is closely related to the drug's level in the plasma. The most probable mechanism involves an effect on glutamatergic synaptic transmission.", "pages": "112-5"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Inhibition of ipsilateral motor cortex during phasic generation of low force.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11137668", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Dettmers, C", "Terborg, C", "Weiller, C"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To study the effect of different types of unilateral pinch grips on excitability of the ipsilateral motor cortex.", "pages": "112-5"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Opposite effects of high and low frequency rTMS on regional brain activity in depressed patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "11137053", "authors": ["Speer, AM", "Kimbrell, TA", "Wassermann, EM", "D Repella, J", "Willis, MW", "Herscovitch, P", "Post, RM"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "In 9 healthy volunteers, transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) were applied over one motor cortex while the subjects performed either phasic or tonic ipsilateral pinch grips with different force levels (range 1-40% maximum voluntary contraction, MVC).
