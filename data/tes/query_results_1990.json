However, the underlying excitatory and inhibitory interactions on the corticospinal system across the sleep-wake cycle are poorly understood. Here, we specifically asked whether in the motor cortex short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) can be elicited at all in sleep using the paired-pulse TMS protocol, and if so, how SICI and ICF vary across sleep stages. We studied 28 healthy subjects at interstimulus intervals of 3 ms (SICI) and 10 ms (ICF), respectively. Magnetic stimulation was performed over the hand area of the motor cortex using a focal coil and evoked motor potentials were recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseus muscle (1DI). Relevant data was obtained from 13 subjects (NREM 2: n=7; NREM 3/4: n=7; REM: n=7). Results show that both SICI and ICF were present in NREM sleep. SICI was significantly enhanced in NREM 3/4 as compared to wakefulness and all other sleep stages whereas in NREM 2 neither SICI nor ICF differed from wakefulness. In REM sleep SICI was in the same range as in wakefulness, but ICF was entirely absent. These results in humans support the hypothesis derived from animal experiments which suggests that intracortical inhibitory mechanisms are involved in the control of neocortical pyramidal cells in NREM and REM sleep, but along different intraneuronal circuits. Further, our findings suggest that cortical mechanisms may additionally contribute to the inhibition of spinal motoneurones in REM sleep.", "pages": "695-701"}, {"volume": "130", "title": "[A new method for the treatment of depression: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "14744574", "authors": ["Cordes, J", "Mobascher, A", "Arends, M", "Agelink, MW", "Klimke, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)", "abstract": "Recent data suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in treating depressive symptoms to a lesser extent compared with classical electroconvulsive therapy. However, rTMS represents an economical and well tolerable procedure in relation to the expenditure of electroconvulsive therapy with anaesthesia. Usually, rTMS is applicated as an add-on-therapy accompanying psychopharmacological treatment. So far, it has predominantly been used for patients with long-standing and so called treatment-refractory symptoms. However, even in the early phase of a depressive episode rTMS would be possibly more effective. In many cases, the standard procedure-application of up to 10 rTMS-sessions will not be enough to produce therapeutic benefit. Therefore rTMS series including up to 20 sessions are recommended. Long-term studies are needed to clarify the role of rTMS for relapse prevention and to determine the optimal frequency and duration of rTMS in such an indication. Although numerous results of newer studies suggest a moderate antidepressive effect of rTMS, its application in daily clinical routine practice cannot be recommended yet. Larger, accurate designed and controlled studies, especially involving patients of old age, are needed to evaluate the true tolerability and effectiveness of rTMS as a new treatment option for depressive symptoms.", "pages": "695-701"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Intraoperative motor mapping of the cerebral peduncle during resection of a midbrain cavernous malformation: technical case report.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2 Suppl", "pmid": "4370112", "authors": ["Qui\u00f1ones-Hinojosa, A", "Lyon, R", "Du, R", "Lawton, MT"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Brainstem cavernous malformations that seem to come to a pial or ependymal surface on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies may, in fact, be covered by an intact layer of neural tissue.

Additionally, there have been indirect indications that TMS may possess anxiolytic features. This study examines the effects of TMS in animal models of one-trial learning and anxiety. In this study, short-term treatment with TMS compared with identically handled animals not given TMS in adult rats resulted in no significant differences in memory as assessed both by a one-time learning paradigm and by components of an elevated-plus maze task, that TMS does not impair memory as assessed by these tasks. In addition, no changes were found in anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze task. In summary, these findings support previous reports that TMS does not interfere with memory function.
