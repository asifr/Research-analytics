In the present study we assessed whether single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can interfere with the performance of normal subjects in a standard visuo-spatial task. Participants had to perform a landmark task while TMS was applied over the right PPC, the homologue region in the left hemisphere or the right primary motor cortex. Stimulation was time-locked to the stimulus presentation with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) varying between 50 and 200 ms. Our results indicate that TMS interfered mainly with the visuo-spatial task when applied over the right PPC at an early stage (50 ms post-stimulus). The interference effect of single-pulse TMS in the present visuo-spatial processing is revealed by a processing cost for ipsilateral targets. These results are in agreement with neuropsychological and brain imaging studies showing a right hemispheric dominance in visuo-spatial processing but add crucial information about the time-course of visuo-spatial processing within the right PPC.", "pages": "2369-74"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "A controlled study of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment of depression in the elderly.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11495396", "authors": ["Manes, F", "Jorge, R", "Morcuende, M", "Yamada, T", "Paradiso, S", "Robinson, RG"], "year": "2001", "journal": "International psychogeriatrics / IPA", "abstract": "Rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsal lateral frontal cortex has been shown to produce antidepressant effects.

Inhibitory and facilitatory neuronal circuits may be explored in the human motor cortex by double pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). At short interstimulus intervals (2-5 ms), conditioned motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are reduced (intracortical inhibition, ICI), whereas they are facilitated at longer interstimulus intervals (8-25 ms; intracortical facilitation, ICF). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of homonymous and antagonist nerve stimulation on the intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the cortical areas that control the wrist extensor and flexor radialis muscles. 2. Sixteen subjects were asked to contract either their wrist extensor or flexor muscles. The MEP evoked by a test TMS (at 1.2 x MEP threshold) and recorded in the target muscle was then conditioned by subthreshold TMS (at 0.8 x MEP threshold) 2 and 14 ms before the test TMS. The median and radial nerves were stimulated at 0.8 x motor threshold (MT). 3. In both flexor and extensor muscles, antagonist nerve stimulation 40 ms before the test TMS decreased ICI and increased ICF. In contrast, homonymous nerve stimulation had no effect on ICI and ICF. 4. The intensity of the antagonist nerve stimulation required to alter ICI and ICF was as low as 0.6 x MT, which suggests that thick diameter afferents may be involved. The nerve stimulation had to be applied 35-45 ms prior to the test TMS to alter significantly the intracortical excitability. 5. Cutaneous afferents were probably not responsible for the alterations of intracortical excitability, since cutaneous stimulation had no effect on either ICI or ICF at the investigated intervals. 6. The present data suggest that antagonist muscular afferent inputs may evoke reciprocal facilitation or disinhibition at the cortical level. This pattern of antagonist sensory afferent effects may be of significance for control of the wrist extensor and flexor muscles when used as synergists during manipulatory finger movements and gripping tasks.", "pages": "2369-74"}, {"volume": "139", "title": "Symmetric facilitation between motor cortices during contraction of ipsilateral hand muscles.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11483718", "authors": ["Stinear, CM", "Walker, KS", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Two sessions at a 1-week interval, each consisting of an adaptation night (sham stimulation) and an experimental night (rTMS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation; crossover design), were scheduled. In each subject, 40 trains of 2-s duration of rTMS (inter-train interval 28 s) were applied at a frequency of 20 Hz (i.e. 1600 pulses per session) and at an intensity of 90% of the motor threshold. Stimulations were scheduled 80 min before lights off. The waking EEG was recorded for 10-min intervals approximately 30 min prior to and after the 20-min stimulations, and polysomnographic recordings were obtained during the subsequent sleep episode (23.00-07.00 h). The power spectra of two referential derivations, as well as of bipolar derivations along the antero-posterior axis over the left and right hemispheres, were analyzed. rTMS induced a small reduction of sleep stage 1 (in min and percentage of total sleep time) over the whole night and a small enhancement of sleep stage 4 during the first non-REM sleep episode. Other sleep variables were not affected. rTMS of the left dorsolateral cortex did not alter the topography of EEG power spectra in waking following stimulation, in the all-night sleep EEG, or during the first non-REM sleep episode.

This pattern of activation resembles a network of presumably interconnected visual and visuomotor areas. Analysis of activation sites supplies new information about cerebral correlates of phosphenes and shows that the cortical region underneath the cranial stimulation site is not necessarily the origin of behavioral and/or perceptual effects of transcranial stimulation.

Focal magnetic pulses to the left motor cortex were delivered with a figure-of-eight coil at the random interstimulus interval of 1.5-2.5 s. The stimulation intensity was adjusted to the motor threshold of abductor digiti minimi. Two conditions before and after ethanol ingestion (30 min) were applied: (1) real TMS, with the coil pressed against the scalp; and (2) control condition, with the coil separated from the scalp by a 2-cm-thick piece of plastic. A separate EMG control recording of one subject during TMS was made with two bipolar platinum needle electrodes inserted to the left temporal muscle. In each condition, 120 pulses were delivered. The EEG was recorded from 60 scalp electrodes. A peak in the EEG signals was observed at 43 ms after the TMS pulse in the real-TMS condition but not in the control condition or in the control scalp EMG. Potential maps before and after ethanol ingestion were significantly different from each other (P = 0.01), but no differences were found in the control condition. Ethanol changed the TMS-evoked potentials over right frontal and left parietal areas, the underlying effect appearing to be largest in the right prefrontal area.

In amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) these volleys are dispersed and prolonged, attributed to altered motor cortical excitability. Impaired intracortical inhibition, as found in ALS, is not unique to this disease, but is also a well-established finding in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study explored whether reduced inhibition in the motor cortex in PD is accompanied by similar changes in motor unit firing modulation by TMS as are found in ALS. TMS was applied to the contralateral motor cortex during a low-force voluntary elbow flexion while 126-channel surface electromyography (SEMG) was recorded from the brachial biceps muscle. A recently developed method for SEMG decomposition was used to extract the firing pattern of up to five simultaneously active MUs. Sixteen MUs in 7 PD patients and 17 MUs in 5 healthy control subjects were analysed and peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) and interspike interval change functions (IICFs) were calculated. The IICF provides an estimate of the modulation of the postsynaptic membrane potential at the spinal motoneuron, evoked by the stimulus. In PD the duration of the PSTH peak was significantly increased and the synchrony was decreased. The excitatory phase at 20-50 ms of the IICF was broader in PD, reflecting a longer duration of the TMS-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential. It is proposed that these results are due to prolonged corticospinal volleys resulting from impaired intracortical inhibition.", "pages": "2369-74"}, {"volume": "138", "title": "Asymmetry of motor cortex excitability during a simple motor task: relationships with handedness and manual performance.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "8120818", "authors": ["Brouwer, B", "Sale, MV", "Nordstrom, MA"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It was hypothesised that asymmetry in corticospinal activation of the two hands may be related to hand preference and interlimb differences in manual performance. Subjects performed isometric index finger abduction at force levels of 0.5 N, 1 N and 2 N while TMS was applied at resting threshold intensity (T), 0.9T, or 0.8T. The amount of contraction-induced facilitation of the muscle evoked potential (MEP) was used as an estimate of corticospinal involvement in the task. Patterns of MEP facilitation in each hand were compared with measures of manual performance (finger tapping speed, Purdue pegboard, maximal FDI strength). Threshold TMS intensities for an MEP in FDI at rest were similar in LH and RH subjects, and did not vary between hands. Facilitation of the MEP with voluntary activation was larger overall on the left side (P<0.05), but the asymmetry was dependent on the degree of lateralisation of hand preference. For subjects with consistent hand preference (either LH or RH), MEP facilitation in active FDI was larger for the left hand. For non-consistent RH subjects, contraction-induced MEP facilitation was larger in the right FDI muscle than the left. Asymmetry of MEP facilitation was not correlated with differences between hands in finger tapping speed or performance in the pegboard task, but was associated with relative differences in FDI strength. MEP facilitation tended to be larger in the stronger FDI muscle of the pair. We conclude that corticospinal involvement in the command for index finger abduction is generally greater when the left hand is used, although in RH subjects the asymmetry is influenced by the degree of lateralisation of hand preference. The corticospinal asymmetry is not related to speed or dexterity of finger movements, but the association with muscle strength suggests that it may be influenced in part by preferential use of one hand for tasks which strengthen the FDI muscle.", "pages": "2369-74"}, {"volume": "138", "title": "Modulation of intracortical inhibition induced by low- and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "7701936", "authors": ["Fierro, B", "Piazza, A", "Brighina, F", "La Bua, V", "Buffa, D", "Oliveri, M"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
