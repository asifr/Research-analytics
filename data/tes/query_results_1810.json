Multiple MRI derived finite element head models were constructed and evaluated to address the effects that strokes can have on the induced stimulating TMS currents by comparing stroke models of various sizes and geometries to a healthy head model under a number of stimulation conditions. The TMS induced currents were significantly altered for stimulation proximal to the lesion site in all of the models analyzed. The current density distributions were modified in magnitude, location, and orientation such that the population of neural elements that are stimulated will be correspondingly altered. The current perturbations were minimized for conditions tested where the coil was far removed from the lesion site, including models of stimulation contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere. The present limitations of TMS to the peri-lesional cortex are explored, ultimately concluding that conventional clinical standards for stimulation are unreliable and potentially dangerous predictors of the site and degree of stimulation when TMS is applied proximal to infarction site.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Recent progress in pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options of major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16472142", "authors": ["Baghai, TC", "M\u00f6ller, HJ", "Rupprecht, R"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "abstract": "In spite of recent progress in the pharmacotherapy of depression major issues are still unresolved. These include the non-response rate of approximately 30% to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy, side effects of available antidepressants and the latency of several weeks until clinical improvement. The only non-pharmacological biological treatment options available so far which exert more rapid antidepressant efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy and, as an augmentation strategy, sleep deprivation. Current pharmacological treatments aim to enhance serotonergic and/or noradrenergic neurotransmission. In spite of emerging knowledge, the crucial mechanisms underlying both non-pharmacological treatments, which are responsible for antidepressant efficacy, are not yet clear so far. In the meantime several new pharmacological principles are under investigation with regard to their putative antidepressant potency. These include 5-HT1A receptor agonists, tachykinin receptor antagonists and various interventions within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. While there is evidence for antidepressant properties of these new treatments in animal studies, in case series, in open studies and to some degree also in placebo controlled studies, no definite proof for the antidepressant efficacy of these new pharmacological strategies according to the requirements for evaluation of antidepressant drugs has been furnished so far. In contrast, for the established non-pharmacological treatment strategies including bright light therapy the clinical efficacy has been proven at least in subgroups of depression, but more knowledge of the main mechanisms underlying their antidepressant efficacy is still necessary. In addition new non-pharmacological treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and Vagus nerve stimulation are currently under development. Nevertheless, a follow-up of both the new pharmacological strategies and non-pharmacological treatment options is of major importance to provide even better strategies for the clinical management of depression, which also is of great socio-economic impact.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "69", "title": "A direct demonstration of cortical LTP in humans: a combined TMS/EEG study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16464689", "authors": ["Esser, SK", "Huber, R", "Massimini, M", "Peterson, MJ", "Ferrarelli, F", "Tononi, G"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is increasingly being used to promote cortical reorganization, under the assumption that it can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of neural responses. This assumption is supported by several lines of indirect evidence. For example, rTMS of motor cortex can induce a potentiation of muscle motor evoked potentials that outlasts the stimulation by several minutes. In animal models, a direct demonstration of LTP is typically obtained by high-frequency electrical stimulation coupled with local field recordings of population responses. In this study, we exploited a new approach based on combined rTMS/high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) to obtain direct, noninvasive evidence for LTP in humans. Cortical responses to single TMS pulses were measured with hd-EEG before and after applying rTMS to motor cortex (5Hz, 1500 pulses). The results demonstrate that, after rTMS, EEG responses at latencies of 15-55ms were significantly potentiated. A topographic analysis revealed that this potentiation was significant at EEG electrodes located bilaterally over premotor cortex. Thus, these findings provide a direct demonstration in humans of LTP induced by rTMS.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "172", "title": "Asymmetries of long-latency intracortical inhibition in motor cortex and handedness.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16463150", "authors": ["Hammond, GR", "Garvey, CA"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

These findings suggest that asymmetrical function of long-latency inhibitory circuits in motor cortex might contribute to the asymmetrical dexterity between the hands, possibly through their inhibitory control of the circuits responsible for short-latency inhibition.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation and the visual cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "16459203", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "Neuroplastic changes are defined as enduring changes in the organization of the central nervous system, such as the strength of connections, representational patterns, or neuronal properties, either morphological or functional. In recent years, new tools have emerged to induce and manipulate ongoing neuroplastic changes by external stimulation, either by modification of synchronized neuronal activity or modulation of the spontaneous firing rate. The first is performed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the latter by direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS as a tool aims to induce prolonged neuronal excitability and activity alterations in the human brain via alterations of the neuronal membrane potential and results in prolonged synaptic efficacy changes. Apart from its impressive persistent excitability effects, it is a non-invasive method and can be applied painlessly. Most likely that up- or downregulation of different cortical areas by tDCS will open a new branch in the area of visual psychophysics.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "1073-1074", "title": "Changes in corticomotor excitability of forearm muscles in relation to static shoulder positions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "16457787", "authors": ["Ginanneschi, F", "Dominici, F", "Biasella, A", "Gelli, F", "Rossi, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "We examined whether the recruitment properties of the corticospinal pathway to forearm muscles are influenced by variations of the shoulder joint angle. Flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation were examined during different static positions of shoulder joint in the horizontal plane: from 30 degrees abduction to 30 degrees adduction. We found that at 30 degrees shoulder adduction, maximum slope and plateau phase of the ECR and FCR input-output relationship (i.e., relation between MEP size and stimulus intensity) were significantly higher and lower than at 30 degrees abduction of the shoulder joint, respectively. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) of the FCR were assessed using a paired-magnetic pulse paradigm. A significant decrease in ICF was observed after changing shoulder position from 30 degrees abduction to 30 degrees adduction. On the contrary, no variation in the amount of ICI occurred in relation to the same changes in shoulder position. FCR H-reflex to electrical stimulation of median nerve at elbow did not differ significantly between the two shoulder positions. We conclude that shoulder position influences the recruitment efficiency (gain) of the corticospinal volleys to motoneurones of forearm muscles. It is proposed that activity of peripheral receptors signaling static shoulder position influences corticomotor excitability of forearm muscles mainly at cortical level, although C3-C4 propriospinal system could be also involved. It is proposed that the above changes in corticomotoneuronal excitability to forearm muscles as function of shoulder joint position are part of a global proximal-distal synergy operating throughout reaching movements.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "398", "title": "After-effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cortical spreading depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "16448754", "authors": ["Liebetanz, D", "Fregni, F", "Monte-Silva, KK", "Oliveira, MB", "Am\u00e2ncio-dos-Santos, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Guedes, RC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Abnormal cortical excitability influences susceptibility to cortical spreading depression (CSD) in migraine. Because transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is capable of inducing lasting changes of cortical excitability, we investigated the after-effects of tDCS on the propagation velocity of CSD in the rat. Twenty-five anesthetised rats received either anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS. The stimulation was applied for 20 min at a current strength of 200 microA after the recording of three baseline CSD measurements. Starting 5 min after tDCS, a further three CSDs were elicited and CSD velocity recorded at intervals of 20 min. tDCS and CSD recording was performed under anaesthesia with chloralose and urethane. As compared to the baseline velocity of 3.14 mm/min, anodal tDCS induced a significant increase of propagation velocity during the first post-tDCS recording (3.49 mm/min). In contrast to anodal tDCS, neither cathodal tDCS nor sham tDCS, which consisted of an initial ramped DC stimulation lasting only 20 s, showed a significant effect on CSD propagation velocity. As anodal tDCS is known to induce a lasting increase of cortical excitability in the clinical setting, our results support the notion that CSD propagation velocity reflects cortical excitability. Since cortical excitability and susceptibility to CSD is elevated in migraine patients, anodal tDCS - by increasing cortical excitability - might increase the probability of migraine attack in these patients, even beyond the end of its application.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "[Newer treatment of epilepsy--brain pacemakers and transcranial magnetic stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "16447765", "authors": ["Akamatsu, N"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Rinsh\u014d shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "abstract": "The antiepileptic medication and surgical treatment had brought many patients with epilepsy to be seizure free, however, one third of the patients continue to experience seizures. There has recently been an explosion of research into brain stimulation for treating these intractable epilepsy patients. This is largely due to the success of deep brain stimulation of movement disorders. The intelligent cardiac pacemakers also stimulated the neurosurgeons to utilize the implantable devices. In this paper, brain stimulations with vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), depth electrodes, subdural electrodes, external responsive neuro-stimulator, implantable brain stimulator and transcranial magnetic stimulator are reviewed. The VNS had been approved in Europe and United States for clinical use. The efficacy of the VNS has already proven by the controlled trials. Stimulation of the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and hippocampus showed some efficacy in a small number of patients, however, large scale traials remains to be undertaken. External responsive neurostimulator has shown efficacy and safety to justify further studies with implantable brain stimulators. The multi-center cooperative study is ongoing in the US to examine the usefulness of the implantable stimulator.

It is by now not yet fully understood whether rTMS has a therapeutic effect on those diseases. The controversy arises from the differences of the stimulation parameters and evaluation methods of the effects in those studies. The Japanese multi-center, double blinded, sham stimulation controlled trial in 85 patients with PD showed an efficacy in both the rTMS-treated and sham stimulated patients. This result does not prove the efficacy of the rTMS in PD; on the other hand, it does not rule out the efficacy. Possible mechanism of favorable effects of rTMS is related to increasing the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic and mesostriatal system. The other Japanese multi-center, double blinded, sham stimulation controlled trial in 99 patients with spinocerebellar degeneration revealed significant therapeutic effects of rTMS in 51 patients with SCA6. We studied the effects of rTMS on seizure susceptibility in rats which prevented the development of status epilepticus of pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. This finding suggests the possibility of therapeutic use of rTMS in epilepsy. Further studies should be performed aiming to reveal the optimal stimulation parameters, and are necessary to reveal the therapeutic role of the rTMS in neurological and psychiatric diseases.", "pages": "857-70"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Proximal conduction abnormality of the facial nerve in Miller Fisher syndrome: a study using transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16442344", "authors": ["Ar\u00e1nyi, Z", "Szab\u00f3, G", "Szepesi, B", "Folyovich, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To investigate facial nerve conduction, including its proximal segment, in Miller Fisher syndrome.", "pages": "857-70"}]
