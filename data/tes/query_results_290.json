Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=90) were randomly assigned to sham operation, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and TDCS groups, and underwent sham operation, unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) electrocoagulation, and unilateral MCA electrocoagulation plus TDCS (daily anodal and cathodal 10 Hz, 0.1 mA TDCS for 30 min beginning day 1 after stroke), respectively. Motor function was assessed using the beam walking test (BWT), and density of dendritic spines (DS) and PX1 mRNA expression were compared among groups on days 3, 7, and 14 after stroke. Effects of PX1 blockage on DS in hippocampal neurons after hypoxia-ischemia were observed. TDCS significantly improved motor function on days 7 and 14 after stroke as indicated by reduced BWT scores compared with the MCAO group. The density of DS was decreased after stroke; the TDCS group had increased DS density compared with the MCAO group on days 3, 7, and 14 (all P<0.0001). Cerebral infarction induced increased PX1 mRNA expression on days 3, 7, and 14 (P<0.0001), and the peak PX1 mRNA expression was observed on day 7. TDCS did not decrease the up-regulated PX1 mRNA expression after stroke on day 3, but did reduce the increased post-stroke PX1 mRNA expression on days 7 and 14 (P<0.0001). TDCS increased the DS density after stroke, indicating that it may promote neural plasticity after stroke. TDCS intervention from day 7 to day 14 after stroke demonstrated motor function improvement and can down-regulate the elevated PX1 mRNA expression after stroke.", "pages": "421-6"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[The correction of cognitive and psychological disorders in the patients presenting with vertebrogenic pain syndrome].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "22994056", "authors": ["Sichinava, NV", "Gorbunov, FE", "Strel'nikov, AV", "Luk'ianova, TV"], "year": "", "journal": "Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebno\u012d fizichesko\u012d kultury", "abstract": "The objective of the present study was the dynamic estimation of the intensity of pain syndrome with the use of a visual-analog scale (VAS), characteristics of the psychological status and cognitive disorders, quality of life, and brain electrogenesis in 50 patients presenting with vertebrogenic pain syndrome of lumbar-sacral localization.

Though somatosensory integration has been highly explored in cognitive studies; only a few studies have explored focal modulation of cortical excitability using a speech perception paradigm. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effects of tDCS applied over the temporal cortex of healthy subjects during a go-no-go task in which stimuli were shapes and non-words. Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to receive cathodal, anodal or sham tDCS bilaterally over the superior temporal cortex (the reference electrode was on deltoid) in a counterbalanced order. The effects on judgment of congruency between shapes and non-words in healthy volunteers were measured by a go-no-go task. Our findings show a significant modification of performance according to the polarity of stimulation, task and subject gender. We found that men performed worse on the no-go condition for congruent stimuli during cathodal tDCS. For reaction time, on the other hand, there was a similar effect for anodal and cathodal stimulation. There were significantly faster responses on incongruent trials during both anodal and cathodal tDCS. Along with previous literature showing gender differences in tasks associated with speech perception, the findings of this study provide additional evidence suggesting that men may have a more focal and restricted neural processing in this multisensory integration task.", "pages": "421-6"}, {"volume": "135", "title": "Cholinergic dysfunction contributes to gait disturbance in early Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 9", "pmid": "22961550", "authors": ["Rochester, L", "Yarnall, AJ", "Baker, MR", "David, RV", "Lord, S", "Galna, B", "Burn, DJ"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) increases the excitability of corticospinal (CS) pathways by altering circuits in motor cortex (M1). How NMES affects circuits interposed between the ascending afferent volley and descending CS pathways is not known. Presently, we hypothesized that short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) would be reduced and afferent facilitation (AF) enhanced when NMES increased CS excitability. NMES was delivered for 40 min over the ulnar nerve. To assess CS excitability, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were evoked using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered at 120% resting threshold for first dorsal interosseus muscle. These MEPs increased by \u223c1.7-fold following NMES, demonstrating enhanced CS excitability. SAI and AF were tested by delivering a \"conditioning\" electrical stimulus to the ulnar nerve 18-25 ms and 28-35 ms before a \"test\" TMS pulse, respectively. Conditioned MEPs were compared to unconditioned MEPs evoked in the same trials. TMS was adjusted so unconditioned MEPs were not different before and after NMES. At the SAI interval, conditioned MEPs were 25% smaller than unconditioned MEPs before NMES but conditioned and unconditioned MEPs were not different following NMES. At the AF interval, conditioned MEPs were not different from unconditioned MEPs before NMES, but were facilitated by 33% following NMES. Thus, when NMES increases CS excitability there are concurrent changes in the effect of afferent input on M1 excitability, resulting in a net increase in the excitatory effect of the ascending afferent volley on CS circuits. Maximising this excitatory effect on M1 circuits may help strengthen CS pathways and improve functional outcomes of NMES-based rehabilitation programs.", "pages": "421-6"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "[Transcranial direct current stimulation: a new tool for neurostimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12805105", "authors": ["Thibaut, A", "Chatelle, C", "Gosseries, O", "Laureys, S", "Bruno, MA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Revue neurologique", "abstract": "We aimed to disentangle the proportional contributions of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction to motor impairment in children with spina bifida.

Its pathophysiology is poorly understood; however, cholinergic dysfunction may be a non-dopaminergic contributor to gait. Short-latency afferent inhibition is a surrogate measure of cholinergic activity, allowing the contribution of cholinergic dysfunction to gait to be evaluated. We hypothesized that short-latency afferent inhibition would be an independent predictor of gait dysfunction in early Parkinson's disease. Twenty-two participants with Parkinson's disease and 22 age-matched control subjects took part in the study. Gait was measured objectively using an instrumented walkway (GAITRite), and subjects were asked to walk at their preferred speed for 2 min around a 25-m circuit. Spatiotemporal characteristics (speed, stride length, stride time and step width) and gait dynamics (variability described as the within subject standard deviation of: speed, stride time, stride length and step width) were determined. Short-latency afferent inhibition was measured by conditioning motor evoked potentials, elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, with electrical stimuli delivered to the contralateral median nerve at intervals ranging from N20 (predetermined) to N20 + 4 ms. Short-latency afferent inhibition was determined as the percentage difference between test and conditioned response for all intervals and was described as the group mean. Participants were optimally medicated at the time of testing. Participants with Parkinson's disease had significantly reduced gait speed (P = 0.002), stride length (P = 0.008) and stride time standard deviation (P = 0.001). Short-latency afferent inhibition was also significantly reduced in participants with Parkinson's disease (P = 0.004). In participants with Parkinson's disease, but not control subjects, significant associations were found between gait speed, short-latency afferent inhibition, age and postural instability and gait disorder score (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and attention, whereas global cognition and depression were marginally significant. No other gait variables were associated with short-latency afferent inhibition. A multiple hierarchical regression model explored the contribution of short-latency afferent inhibition to gait speed, controlling for age, posture and gait symptoms (Postural Instability and Gait Disorder score-Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), attention and depression. Regression analysis in participants with Parkinson's disease showed that reduced short-latency afferent inhibition was an independent predictor of slower gait speed, explaining 37% of variability. The final model explained 72% of variability in gait speed with only short-latency afferent inhibition and attention emerging as independent determinants. The results suggest that cholinergic dysfunction may be an important and early contributor to gait dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. The findings also point to the contribution of non-motor mechanisms to gait dysfunction.
