Such effort-induced mirror movements indicate a decreased ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to selectively control individual muscles. We studied whether altered transcallosal inhibition (TCI) contributed to this phenomenon. TCI was determined in ten healthy subjects by measuring the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) and the contralateral silent period (cSP) during a sustained contraction of the abductor digiti minimi, induced by focal unihemispheric ipsilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation. Mirror movements occurred in all subjects in response to the effort. There was a bilateral increase in cSPs and a parallel increase in the iSP in the contralateral working muscle. In contrast, the iSP in the mirroring muscle remained unchanged, explained by a balance of increased crossed pyramidal inhibition (cSP) and decreased transcallosal inhibition. In finely tuned unimanual movements, mirroring activity of the contralateral hand is suppressed by TCI originating in the working hemisphere. During sustained, effortful contractions, the outflow of the contralateral hemisphere is increased due to reduced TCI. Effort-induced mirror contractions are thus the result of disinhibition of contralateral crossed projections rather than disinhibition of ipsilateral uncrossed pathways.", "pages": "26-8"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Specific forms of neural activity associated with tactile space awareness.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "9679174", "authors": ["Oliveri, M", "Rossini, PM", "Filippi, MM", "Traversa, R", "Cicinelli, P", "Caltagirone, C"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation activates corticospinal neurones directly and transsynaptically and hence, activates motoneurones and results in a response in the muscle. Transmastoid stimulation results in a similar muscle response through activation of axons in the spinal cord. This study was designed to determine whether the two stimuli activate the same descending axons. Responses to transcranial magnetic stimuli paired with electrical transmastoid stimuli were examined in biceps brachii in human subjects. Twelve interstimulus intervals (ISIs) from -6 ms (magnet before transmastoid) to 5 ms were investigated. When responses to the individual stimuli were set at 10-15 % of the maximal M-wave, responses to the paired stimuli were larger than expected at ISIs of -6 and -5 ms but were reduced in size at ISIs of -2 to 1 ms and at 3 to 5 ms. With individual responses of 3-5 % of maximal M-wave, facilitation still occurred at ISIs of -6 and -5 ms and depression of the paired response at ISIs of 0, 1, 4 and 5 ms. The interaction of the response to transmastoid stimulation with the multiple descending volleys elicited by magnetic stimulation of the cortex is complex. However, depression of the response to the paired stimuli at short ISIs is consistent with an occlusive interaction in which an antidromic volley evoked by the transmastoid stimulus collides with and annihilates descending action potentials evoked by the transcranial magnetic stimulus. Thus, it is consistent with the two stimuli activating some of the same corticospinal axons.", "pages": "26-8"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Effects of subthalamic nucleus stimulation on motor cortex excitability in Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "10601484", "authors": ["Cunic, D", "Roshan, L", "Khan, FI", "Lozano, AM", "Lang, AE", "Chen, R"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Changes in somatosensory input can remodel human cortical motor organization, yet the input characteristics that promote reorganization and their functional significance have not been explored. Here we show with transcranial magnetic stimulation that sensory-driven reorganization of human motor cortex is highly dependent upon the frequency, intensity, and duration of stimulus applied. Those patterns of input associated with enhanced excitability (5 Hz, 75% maximal tolerated intensity for 10 min) induce stronger cortical activation to fMRI. When applied to acutely dysphagic stroke patients, swallowing corticobulbar excitability is increased mainly in the undamaged hemisphere, being strongly correlated with an improvement in swallowing function. Thus, input to the human adult brain can be programmed to promote beneficial changes in neuroplasticity and function after cerebral injury.", "pages": "26-8"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Neuropsychiatric applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation: a meta analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10601504", "authors": ["Burt, T", "Lisanby, SH", "Sackeim, HA"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)", "abstract": "It is suggested that early in ALS the corticomotor threshold (CMT) is low, but increases with increasing duration of the disease.", "pages": "26-8"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Degree of language lateralization determines susceptibility to unilateral brain lesions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "10638430", "authors": ["Knecht, S", "Fl\u00f6el, A", "Dr\u00e4ger, B", "Breitenstein, C", "Sommer, J", "Henningsen, H", "Ringelstein, EB", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "We compared CMT, central conduction time and motor-evoked response/M-wave amplitude in two populations of ALS patients: one with disease duration shorter than 6 months (Group A, 11 patients) and another who had had the disease for more than 24 months (Group B, 14 patients).
