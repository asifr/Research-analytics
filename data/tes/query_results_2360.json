The neuroprotective effects of our method were investigated using an animal study. Selective spinal hypothermia was produced by means of originally-designed cooling pads placed over the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebral column. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by cross-clamping the thoracic aorta for 60 min in beagle dogs. The neuroprotective effects were evaluated by a multi-modal study. The motor-evoked potentials of the spinal cord resulting from transcranial electric stimulation (MEPs) were recorded during both the ischemic and reperfusion periods. Hindlimb motor function was graded with the Tarlov score, and a histologic examination of the spinal cord injury was performed, at 24 hours after ischemia in animals undergoing hypothermia (hypothermia group: n = 7) or a sham (control group: n = 7). The spinal cord temperatures at the lower thoracic (T10) and lumbar (L3) levels decreased by -9.1 degrees C per hour and -8.1 degrees C per hour, respectively. The amplitude of the MEPs decreased during ischemia in both groups of animals, and significantly recovered during the early phase of aortic reperfusion in the hypothermia group. The Tarlov scores in the hypothermia and control groups were 3.3 +/- 1.0 and 1.1 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SD, p = 0.015), respectively. Histopathologic study revealed that ischemic injury of the lumbar cord was reduced in the animals undergoing hypothermia. Trans-vertebral regional cooling reduced ischemic spinal cord injury in a canine study. The current method is potentially feasible for clinical use, especially in view of its technical simplicity and few procedure-related complications.", "pages": "35-41"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Brain surgery in motor areas: the invaluable assistance of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "14618135", "authors": ["Sala, F", "Lanteri, P"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical sciences", "abstract": "Surgery for tumors in the central and precentral region, as much as for insular tumors, places at risk the functional integrity of the motor cortex and the subcortical motor pathways.

In this task subjects learned which of two outcomes would occur on each trial after presentation of a particular combination of cues. Ten minutes of anodal, but not cathodal, stimulation improved implicit learning only when the left PFC was stimulated. Our results show that implicit PLC can be modified by weak anodal tDCS, which probably increases neural excitability, as has been shown in the motor and visual cortices previously.

The TA electromyogram (EMG) and ankle flexion force were recorded in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the leg area of the motor cortex to evaluate the excitability of cortico-spinal-muscular pathways. Repetitive stimulation of the CP nerve at 25 Hz for 30 min increased the MEP by 50.3 +/- 13.6% (mean +/- S.E.) at a TMS intensity that initially gave a half-maximum MEP (MEPh). In contrast the maximum MEP (MEPmax) did not change. Ankle flexion force (103 +/- 21.9%) and silent period duration (75.3 +/- 12.9%) also increased. These results suggest an increase in corticospinal excitability, rather than total connectivity due to repetitive CP stimulation. Facilitation was evident after as little as 10 min of stimulation and persisted without significant decrement for at least 30 min after stimulation. The long duration of silent period following CP stimulation (99.2 +/- 14.8 ms) suggests that this form of stimulation may have effects on the motor cortex. To exclude the possibility that MEPh facilitation was primarily due to sensory fibre activation, we performed several control experiments. Preferentially activating Ia muscle afferents by vibration in the absence of motor activity had no significant effect. Cutaneous afferent activation via stimulation of the superficial peroneal nerve increased the amplitude of responses at MEPmax rather than MEPh. Concurrent tendon vibration and superficial peroneal nerve stimulation failed to facilitate TA MEP responses. In summary, repetitive electrical stimulation of the CP nerve elicits lasting changes in corticospinal excitability, possibly as a result of co-activating motor and sensory fibres.", "pages": "35-41"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "A TMS coil positioning/holding system for MR image-guided TMS interleaved with fMRI.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "14580621", "authors": ["Bohning, DE", "Denslow, S", "Bohning, PA", "Walker, JA", "George, MS"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The neurophysiological assessment of intramedullary spinal cord lesions has been unsatisfactory.
