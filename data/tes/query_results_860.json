Eleven operators na\u00efve for neuronavigation were asked to position and maintain a figure-of-eight-shaped coil over a dipole probe placed within of a polystyrene reproduction of the human head and scalp, in correspondence of the right primary motor cortex. Ten monophasic magnetic pulses were delivered at 46% maximal stimulator output (MSO) in two different experimental conditions: (1) assisted by an optically tracked neuronavigational system; and (2) without neuronavigation. With neuronavigated stimulation, both standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the voltages induced in the dipole probe were significantly lower than without neuronavigation. Results were confirmed in four operators performing a longer-lasting experiment using 50 magnetic pulses in each condition, at an intensity of at 40% MSO. Findings show that optically tracked neuronavigation improves the stability of focal coil positioning.", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Anodal skin lesions after treatment with transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20633432", "authors": ["Frank, E", "Wilfurth, S", "Landgrebe, M", "Eichhammer, P", "Hajak, G", "Langguth, B"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "In recent years two techniques have become available to stimulate the human brain noninvasively through the scalp: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

Because of this, besides the implications for experimental neuroscientists, there is increasing interest in the potential for applying either method as a therapy in neurology, psychiatry, rehabilitation, and pain.

Around 1% of the population is affected and 30,000 people are handicapped in their daily life. The treatments available for disabling tinnitus have until now been disappointing. We are reporting on the surgical treatment by electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex of a female patient affected by disabling tinnitus that resisted classical treatments. The tinnitus appeared suddenly 10 years ago after a left ear tympanoplasty. The acouphenometry measures revealed a bilateral tinnitus, predominant on the right side, constant, with high frequency (6000 Hz). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed at first with several supraliminal and infraliminal protocols. This showed promising results. Anatomic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory cortex before and after repetitive TMS (rTMS) demonstrated a modification of the cortical activity and where the ideal location for a cortical electrode might be, to straddle primary and secondary auditory cortex. After these investigations, two quadra polar electrodes (Resume, Medtronic Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK), connected to a stimulating device implanted under the skin (Synergy, Medtronic Ltd), were extradurally implanted. The surgical procedure was similar to the one performed for analgesic cortical stimulation. No surgical complications were reported. The activation of the stimulator provided a reduction of 65% of the tinnitus impact, with a persistent effect on the right side. The feasibility of the cortical stimulation in symptomatic treatment of tinnitus was proven by this preparatory work. The middle- and long-term therapeutic effects remain to be evaluated.", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Chronic neuropathic pain alleviation after transcranial direct current stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "20633414", "authors": ["Arul-Anandam, AP", "Loo, C", "Martin, D", "Mitchell, PB"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Current antidepressant therapies do not effectively control or cure depressive symptoms. Pharmaceutical therapies altogether fail to address an estimated 4 million Americans who suffer from a recurrent and severe treatment-resistant form of depression known as refractory major depressive disorder. Subjective diagnostic schemes, differing manifestations of the disorder, and antidepressant treatments with limited theoretical bases each contribute to the general lack of therapeutic efficacy and differing levels of treatment resistance in the refractory population. Stimulation-based therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation, are promising treatment alternatives for this treatment-resistant subset of patients, but are plagued with inconsistent reports of efficacy and variable side effects. Many of these problems stem from the unknown mechanisms of depressive disorder pathogenesis, which prevents the development of treatments that target the specific underlying causes of the disorder. Other problems likely arise due to the non-specific stimulation of various limbic and paralimbic structures in an open-loop configuration. This review critically assesses current literature on depressive disorder diagnostic methodologies, treatment schemes, and pathogenesis in order to emphasize the need for more stringent depressive disorder classifications, quantifiable biological markers that are suitable for objective diagnoses, and alternative closed-loop treatment options tailored to well-defined forms of the disorder. A closed-loop neurostimulation device design framework is proposed, utilizing symptom-linked biomarker abnormalities as control points for initiating and terminating a corrective electrical stimulus which is autonomously optimized for correcting the magnitude and direction of observed biomarker abnormality.", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Surgical treatment by electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex for intractable tinnitus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "20633412", "authors": ["Litr\u00e9, CF", "Theret, E", "Tran, H", "L\u00e9v\u00e8que, M", "Portefaix, C", "Gierski, F", "Emeriau, S", "Peruzzi, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that low- and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces changes in cortical excitability, but there is only indirect evidence of its effects despite a large number of studies employing different stimulation parameters. Typically the cortical modulations are inferred through indirect measurements, such as recording the change in electromyographic responses. Recently it has become possible to directly evaluate rTMS-induced changes at the cortical level using electronencephalography (EEG). The present study investigates the modulation induced by high-frequency rTMS via EEG by evaluating changes in the latency and amplitude of TMS-evoked responses. In this study, rTMS was applied to the left primary motor cortex (MI) in 16 participants while an EEG was simultaneously acquired from 29 scalp electrodes. The rTMS consisted of 40 trains at 20 Hz with 10 stimuli each (a total of 400 stimuli) that were delivered at the individual resting motor threshold. The on-line modulation induced by the high-frequency TMS was characterized by a sequence of EEG responses. Two of the rTMS-induced responses, P5 and N8, were specifically modulated according to the protocol. Their latency decreased from the first to the last TMS stimuli, while the amplitude values increased. These results provide the first direct, on-line evaluation of the effects of high-frequency TMS on EEG activity. In addition, the results provide a direct demonstration of cortical potentiation induced by rTMS in humans.", "pages": "119-23"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "From the Editor-in-Chief's desk.

Changes in the representation of sounds, abnormalities of oscillatory activity, and hyperactivity in higher order areas of auditory processing have been linked with the perception of tinnitus.

Stimulation for few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be caused by stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function through functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis. Single recordings in healthy volunteers with 62 electroencephalography channels were acquired before and after 10 min of facilitatory anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1), combined with inhibitory cathodal tDCS of the contralateral frontopolar cortex, in resting state and during voluntary hand movements. Correlation matrices containing all 62 pairwise electrode combinations were calculated with the synchronization likelihood (SL) method and thresholded to construct undirected graphs for the \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, low-\u03b3 and high-\u03b3 frequency bands. SL matrices and undirected graphs were compared before and after tDCS. Functional connectivity patterns significantly increased within premotor, motor, and sensorimotor areas of the stimulated hemisphere during motor activity in the 60-90 Hz frequency range. Additionally, tDCS-induced significant intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity changes in all the studied frequency bands.
