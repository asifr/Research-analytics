Cortical stimulation was used to evoke measures of voluntary activation and muscle relaxation during and after a contraction sustained at 20% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) until task failure with elbow flexor muscles in 14 young adults (20.9 \u00b1 3.6 yr, 7 men) and 14 old adults (71.6 \u00b1 5.4 yr, 7 men). Old adults exhibited a longer time to task failure than the young adults (23.8 \u00b1 9.0 vs. 11.5 \u00b1 3.9 min, respectively, P < 0.001). The time to failure was associated with initial peak rates of relaxation of muscle fibers and pressor response (P < 0.05). Increments in torque (superimposed twitch; SIT) generated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during brief MVCs, increased during the fatiguing contraction (P < 0.001) and then decreased during recovery (P = 0.02). The increase in the SIT was greater for the old adults than the young adults during the fatiguing contraction and recovery (P < 0.05). Recovery of MVC torque was less for old than young adults at 10 min post-fatiguing contraction (75.1 \u00b1 8.7 vs. 83.6 \u00b1 7.8% of control MVC, respectively, P = 0.01) and was associated with the recovery of the SIT (r = -0.59, r(2) = 0.35, P < 0.001). Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and the silent period elicited during the fatiguing contraction increased less for old adults than young adults (P < 0.05). The greater fatigue resistance with age during a low-intensity sustained contraction was attributable to mechanisms located within the muscle. Recovery of maximal strength after the low-intensity fatiguing contraction however, was impeded more for old adults than young because of greater supraspinal fatigue. Recovery of strength could be an important variable to consider in exercise prescription of old populations.", "pages": "849-58"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "An integrated computer-controlled system for assisting researchers in cortical excitability studies by using transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10561405", "authors": ["Giordano, D", "Kavasidis, I", "Spampinato, C", "Bella, R", "Pennisi, G", "Pennisi, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is the most important technique currently available to study cortical excitability. Additionally, TMS can be used for therapeutic and rehabilitation purposes, replacing the more painful transcranial electric stimulation (TES). In this paper we present an innovative and easy-to-use tool that enables neuroscientists to design, carry out and analyze scientific studies based on TMS experiments for both diagnostic and research purposes, assisting them not only in the practicalities of administering the TMS but also in each step of the entire study's workflow. One important aspect of this tool is that it allows neuroscientists to specify research designs at will, enabling them to define any parameter of a TMS study starting from data acquisition and sample group definition to automated statistical data analysis and RDF data storage. It also supports the diagnosing process by using on-line support vector machines able to learn incrementally from the diseases instances that are continuously added into the system. The proposed system is a neuroscientist-centred tool where the protocols being followed in TMS studies are made explicit, leaving to the users flexibility in exploring and sharing the results, and providing assistance in managing the complexity of the final diagnosis. This type of tool can make the results of medical experiments more easily exploitable, thus accelerating scientific progress.", "pages": "849-58"}, {"volume": "481", "title": "Reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic potentiation resets drug-induced adaptive behaviour.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7379", "pmid": "4708452", "authors": ["Pascoli, V", "Turiault, M", "L\u00fcscher, C"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Nature", "abstract": "Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity is observed at many synapses and may underlie behavioural adaptations in addiction. Mechanistic investigations start with the identification of the molecular drug targets. Cocaine, for example, exerts its reinforcing and early neuroadaptive effects by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, thus causing a strong increase in mesolimbic dopamine. Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation as well as in several behavioural adaptations. A causal link between drug-evoked plasticity at identified synapses and behavioural adaptations, however, is missing, and the benefits of restoring baseline transmission have yet to be demonstrated. Here we find that cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in D1-receptor-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) in mice via ERK signalling with a time course that parallels locomotor sensitization. Depotentiation of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs by optogenetic stimulation in vivo efficiently restored normal transmission and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings establish synaptic potentiation selectively in D1R-MSNs as a mechanism underlying a core component of addiction, probably by creating an imbalance between distinct populations of MSNs in the nucleus accumbens. Our data also provide proof of principle that reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity can treat behavioural alterations caused by addictive drugs and may inspire novel therapeutic approaches involving deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "849-58"}, {"volume": "135", "title": "Cortical activation changes underlying stimulation-induced behavioural gains in chronic stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "11684333", "authors": ["Stagg, CJ", "Bachtiar, V", "O'Shea, J", "Allman, C", "Bosnell, RA", "Kischka, U", "Matthews, PM", "Johansen-Berg, H"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation, a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, is showing increasing promise as an adjunct therapy in rehabilitation following stroke. However, although significant behavioural improvements have been reported in proof-of-principle studies, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The rationale for transcranial direct current stimulation as therapy for stroke is that therapeutic stimulation paradigms increase activity in ipsilesional motor cortical areas, but this has not previously been directly tested for conventional electrode placements. This study was performed to test directly whether increases in ipsilesional cortical activation with transcranial direct current stimulation are associated with behavioural improvements in chronic stroke patients. Patients at least 6\u2009months post-first stroke participated in a behavioural experiment (n\u2009=\u200913) or a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (n\u2009=\u200911), each investigating the effects of three stimulation conditions in separate sessions: anodal stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere; cathodal stimulation to the contralesional hemisphere; and sham stimulation. Anodal (facilitatory) stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere led to significant improvements (5-10%) in response times with the affected hand in both experiments. This improvement was associated with an increase in movement-related cortical activity in the stimulated primary motor cortex and functionally interconnected regions. Cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation to the contralesional hemisphere led to a functional improvement only when compared with sham stimulation. We show for the first time that the significant behavioural improvements produced by anodal stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere are associated with a functionally relevant increase in activity within the ipsilesional primary motor cortex in patients with a wide range of disabilities following stroke.", "pages": "849-58"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Pharyngeal motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation for intraoperative monitoring during skull base surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "12115966", "authors": ["Fukuda, M", "Oishi, M", "Hiraishi, T", "Saito, A", "Fujii, Y"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether monitoring of pharyngeal motor evoked potentials (PhMEPs) elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation during skull base tumor surgery might be useful for predicting postoperative swallowing deterioration.", "pages": "849-58"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Neurophysiologic monitoring of the spinal accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and the spinomedullary region.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "7154893", "authors": ["Skinner, SA"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "The authors analyzed PhMEPs in 21 patients during 22 surgical procedures for the treatment of skull base tumors.

The aim of the present experiments was to test whether it is possible to observe similar phenomena in humans with the aim of improving present protocols of inducing synaptic plasticity for therapeutic purposes. We tested whether the LTP/LTD-like after effects of transcranial theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of human motor cortex, an analogue of patterned electrical stimulation in animals, were affected by simultaneous transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive method of polarising cortical neurones in humans. Nine healthy volunteers were investigated in a single-blind, balanced cross-over study; continuous TBS (cTBS) was used to introduce LTD-like after effects, whereas intermittent TBS (iTBS) produced LTP-like effects. Each pattern was coupled with concurrent application of tDCS (<200\u00a0s, anodal, cathodal, sham). Cathodal tDCS increased the response to iTBS and abolished the effects of cTBS. Anodal tDCS changed the effects of cTBS towards facilitation, but had no impact on iTBS. Cortical motor thresholds and intracortical inhibitory/facilitatory networks were not altered by any of the stimulation protocols. We conclude that the after effects of TBS can be modulated by concurrent tDCS. We hypothesise that tDCS changes the membrane potential of the apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurones and that this changes the response to patterned synaptic input evoked by TBS. The data show that it may be possible to enhance LTP-like plasticity after TBS in the human cortex.", "pages": "849-58"}]
