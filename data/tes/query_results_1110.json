Tinnitus severity and loudness were monitored using a tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) before each session. Patients received 600 pulses of continuous TBS (cTBS), intermittent TBS (iTBS) and intermediate TBS (imTBS) over left inferior temporal cortex with an intensity of 80% of the individual active or resting motor threshold. Changes in subjective tinnitus perception were measured with a numerical rating scale (NRS).", "pages": "54"}, {"volume": "196", "title": "Enhancement of pinch force in the lower leg by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "18385988", "authors": ["Tanaka, S", "Hanakawa, T", "Honda, M", "Watanabe, K"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It has been reported that tDCS over the hand motor cortex transiently improves the performance of hand motor tasks. Here, we investigated whether tDCS could also improve leg motor functions. Ten healthy subjects performed pinch force (PF) and reaction time (RT) tasks using the left leg before, during and after anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS over the leg motor cortex. The anodal tDCS transiently enhanced the maximal leg PF but not RT during its application. Neither cathodal nor sham stimulation changed the performance. None of the interventions affected hand PF or RT, showing the spatial specificity of the effect of tDCS. These results indicate that motor performance of not only the hands but also the legs can be enhanced by anodal tDCS. tDCS may be applicable to the neuro-rehabilitation of patients with leg motor disability.", "pages": "54"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "The cortical site of visual suppression by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18359361", "authors": ["Thielscher, A", "Reichenbach, A", "U\u011furbil, K", "Uluda\u011f, K"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Medial frontal cortex (MFC) is crucial when actions have to be inhibited, reprogrammed, or selected under conflict, but the precise mechanism by which it operates is unclear.

Using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, we investigated functional connectivity between the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) part of MFC and M1. We found that functional connectivity increased in a manner dependent on cognitive context: pre-SMA facilitated the motor evoked-potential elicited by M1 stimulation only during action reprogramming, but not when otherwise identical actions were made in the absence of conflict. The effect was anatomically specific to pre-SMA; it was not seen when adjacent brain regions were stimulated.

Theoretically, neurostimulation allows the control of seizures to be tailored to the individual patient and specific form of epilepsy. Here, we review both experimental and clinical studies that have reported the possible control of epileptic seizures by means of different approaches using electrical stimulation (vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). The rationale for targeting specific areas that have thus far been considered (i.e., vagus nerve, cerebellum, anterior or centromedial thalamus, basal ganglia, cortex and temporal lobe) is addressed in the light of experimental data and clinical effectiveness in different models and forms of epilepsy. The type of seizures that can be considered for neurostimulation, as well as the optimal parameters such as stimulation frequency and modes of stimulation (chronic, continuous or adaptative), are discussed to determine the best candidates for such a therapeutic strategy. This review points out the need for improved knowledge of neural circuits that generate seizures and/or allow their propagation, as well as a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of neurostimulation.", "pages": "54"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Identification of potential neuromotor mechanisms of manual therapy in patients with musculoskeletal disablement: rationale and description of a clinical trial.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "18066684", "authors": ["Fisher, BE", "Davenport, TE", "Kulig, K", "Wu, AD"], "year": "2009", "journal": "BMC neurology", "abstract": "In visual suppression paradigms, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied approximately 90 ms after visual stimulus presentation over occipital visual areas can robustly interfere with visual perception, thereby most likely affecting feedback activity from higher areas (Amassian VE, Cracco RQ, Maccabee PJ, Cracco JB, Rudell A, Eberle L. 1989. Suppression of visual perception by magnetic coil stimulation of human occipital cortex. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 74:458-462.). It is speculated that the observed effects might stem primarily from the disruption of V1 activity. This hypothesis, although under debate, argues in favor of a special role of V1 in visual awareness. In this study, we combine TMS, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and calculation of the induced electric field to study the neural correlates of visual suppression. For parafoveal visual stimulation in the lower right half of the visual field, area V2d is shown to be the likely TMS target based on its anatomical location close to the skull surface. Furthermore, isolated stimulation of area V3 also results in robust visual suppression. Notably, V3 stimulation does not directly affect the feedback from higher visual areas that is relayed mainly via V2 to V1. These findings support the view that intact activity patterns in several early visual areas (rather than merely in V1) are likewise important for the perception of the stimulus.", "pages": "54"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "3D modeling of the total electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation using the boundary element method.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "18202212", "authors": ["Salinas, FS", "Lancaster, JL", "Fox, PT"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "abstract": "The ability to generate torque during a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) changes over the day. The present experiments were designed to determine the influence of an individual's chronotype on this diurnal rhythm and on cortical, spinal, and peripheral mechanisms that may be related to torque production. After completing a questionnaire to determine chronotype, 18 subjects (9 morning people, 9 evening people) participated in 4 data collection sessions (at 09:00, 13:00, 17:00, and 21:00) over 1 day. We used magnetic stimulation of the cortex, electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve, electromyographic (EMG) recordings of muscle activity, and isometric torque measurements to evaluate the excitability of the motor cortex, the spinal cord, and the torque-generating capacity of the triceps surae (TS) muscles. We found that for morning people, cortical excitability was highest at 09:00, spinal excitability was highest at 21:00, and there were no significant differences in TS EMG or torque produced during MVCs over the day. In contrast, evening people showed parallel increases in cortical and spinal excitability over the day, and these were associated with increased TS EMG and MVC torque. There were no differences at the level of the muscle over the day between morning and evening people. We propose that the simultaneous increases in cortical and spinal excitability increased central nervous system drive to the muscles of evening people, thus increasing torque production over the day. These differences in cortical excitability and performance of a motor task between morning and evening people have implications for maximizing human performance and highlight the influence of chronotype on an individual's diurnal rhythms.", "pages": "54"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "2008: the year in review.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17956800", "authors": ["Peroutka, SJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Headache", "abstract": "Many health care practitioners use a variety of hands-on treatments to improve symptoms and disablement in patients with musculoskeletal pathology.Research to date indirectly suggests a potentially broad effect of manual therapy on the neuromotor processing of functional behavior within the supraspinal central nervous system (CNS) in a manner that may be independent of modification at the level of local spinal circuits.
