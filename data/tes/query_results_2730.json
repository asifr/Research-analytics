However, according to an anterior dimensional model of negative affect this is unlikely to be true when threat is of social origin. Social threat is communicated by the angry facial expression, and recent research indicates that prioritized processing of angry faces is motivated by anger. Anger is a sympathetically dominated emotion, and for its expression and experience, neuroimaging data have demonstrated anterior lateralization to the left hemisphere. To scrutinize the above diverging statements, suprathreshold low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied over the right and the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) of ten healthy subjects during 15min continuously, and the subsequent effects on sympathetic and parasympathetic activity of the heart, and selective attention to angry facial expressions were investigated. Combined rTMS-neuroimaging studies have shown contralateral excitation after unilateral supratheshold low-frequency rTMS, hence the strengthening of contralaterally mediated emotion functions. The earlier reported increases in selective attention to angry facial expressions after right-PFC rTMS were found to be accompanied by and significantly associated with elevations in sympathetic activity. Our data suggest that a left-PFC lateralized, sympathetic mechanism directs attention towards the angry facial expression.", "pages": "99-102"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "[The effects of graded spinal cord injuries on transcranial electric stimulation motor evoked potentials in the rat].", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "11825429", "authors": ["Yu, K", "Li, J", "Jia, L", "Bao, J", "Yuan, W", "Ye, T", "Cui, Y"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]", "abstract": "To study the effects of graded spinal cord injury (SCI) on the motor evoked potentials (MEP) characteristics and the prognostic value of MEP for the motor function.", "pages": "99-102"}, {"volume": "159", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation for panic.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11823280", "authors": ["Zwanzger, P", "Minov, C", "Ella, R", "Sch\u00fcle, C", "Baghai, T", "M\u00f6ller, HJ", "Rupprecht, R", "Padberg, F"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The American journal of psychiatry", "abstract": "Modified Allen's method was used by weight drop force of 30 gcf, 50 gcf, 80 gcf and 100 gcf on the T(8 - 9) spinal cord of 40 SD rats in order to make SCI models.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cortical activities during two types of Go/NoGo task with different movement instructions (Push-Go and Release-Go) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and event-related potential (ERP) recordings. In the Push-Go condition, ten subjects were instructed either to push a button with their right index finger as fast as possible after a Go signal or not to push it after a NoGo signal. In the Release-Go condition, they were asked beforehand to continually depress a button by pushing, and instructed either to release it as fast as possible after a Go signal or not to release it after a NoGo signal. TMS was applied to the left primary motor cortex at 20--300 ms after each signal. In the Push-Go condition trials, the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle significantly increased at 120--300 ms after the Go signals and decreased at 160--200 ms after the NoGo signals. In contrast, the MEP amplitudes recorded during the Release-Go condition trials significantly decreased at 160--300 ms after the Go signals and significantly increased at 160--180 and 220--300 ms after the NoGo signals. On the other hand, the ERPs recorded in the frontocentral cortex after each signal for five of the subjects were identical in both the Push-Go and Release-Go condition trials. These results indicated that, while the cortical activities related to the Go/NoGo decision were similar in the two task conditions, the corticospinal excitability was modulated so as to suppress or facilitate the required Go responses depending on the given movement instructions. This suggests that the Go/NoGo decision may be separate from the subsequent motor program.", "pages": "99-102"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Inverse correlation of intracortical inhibition and brain-stem inhibition in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11801433", "authors": ["Sommer, M", "Heise, A", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We report a 77-year-old woman with restless legs syndrome(RLS) and periodic limb movement(PLM). From 62 years of age, she was awakened by tingling and involuntary movement in her legs during sleep. There symptoms disappeared when she stood up and walked. She was treated with clonazepam (2.5 mg/day) and valproate (400 mg/day) at 77 years of age, and the symptoms clearly ameliorated. However, she developed mild truncal ataxia and was referred to our hospital. On admission, neurological examination revealed Babinski and Chaddock signs bilaterally with depressed tendon reflexes in the lower limbs, mild truncal ataxia and horizontal gaze nystagmus. She did not present with involuntary movement of the legs while taking the anti-epileptic drugs. Cessation of these drugs alleviated the truncal ataxia and nystagmus, but reexacerbated abnormal sensation with involuntary movement in her legs during sleep. The involuntary movements in her legs were slower than myoclonus and resembled a Babinski reflex (duration about 1 second), and they appeared periodically (around every 30 seconds) in I-II sleep stages. Neither brain MRI nor EEG detected any abnormality. Cervical MRI revealed focal compression of the spinal cord by osteophytes at C5-C6 (more severe on the left side). Motor evoked potentials with transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed a mild delay in the central conduction time (CCT), which was more prolonged on the left side. She was thus diagnosed as having RLS/PLM with involvement of the bilateral pyramidal tracts. Although nerve conduction studies did not detect any abnormality in the peripheral nerves, RLS/PLM of the left leg was induced by electric stimulation of the left tibial nerve. Because she did not want medication any more, we treated her with a lumbar corset, hoping that wearing a lumbar corset might induce contraction of the truncal muscles that would mimic standing and walking or might produce additional sensory input that would induce a 'sensory trick'. Consequently, her abnormal sensation and involuntary movement during sleep as well as the stimulation of the tibial nerve disappeared. Wearing a lumbar corset may inhibit the excitability of the spinal cord that generates RLS/PLM, though the level of sensory input by the corset was higher than the input level of abnormal sensation in her legs. A lumbar corset may be a useful alternative choice for patients with RLS/PLM, who cannot tolerate either anti-epileptic or dopaminergic drugs.", "pages": "99-102"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Descending volleys evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain in conscious humans: effects of coil shape.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11801432", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Oliviero, A", "Pilato, F", "Saturno, E", "Insola, A", "Mazzone, P", "Tonali, PA", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Brain imaging studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is biologically active. The aim of the present study was to investigate the patterns of the regional cerebral glucose uptake rate (rCMRGlu) and regional (99m)Tc HMPAO uptake rate (regional cerebral blood flow; rCBF) during a series of therapeutic rTMS sessions at low frequency. Four drug-resistant depressed patients underwent 10 rTMS sessions as an add-on measure over 14 days. One day before and 1 day after the TMS series, 511-keV SPECT with simultaneous (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (99m)Tc HMPAO measurements were carried out. All patients showed a good clinical outcome. Statistically significant common changes in rCBF and rCMRGlu patterns were found in the upper frontal regions bilaterally in terms of increased uptake rates and in the left orbitofrontal cortex in terms of decreased uptake rates of both isotopes compared to controls. However, the lateralization patterns of rCBF and rCMRGlu after rTMS treatment revealed marked differences. Thus, although no relevant changes in lateralization of the glucose uptake were observed, a clear right-sided preponderance of rCBF also in areas remote from the stimulation site was described. Therapeutic rTMS seems to influence distinct cortical regions, affecting rCBF and rCMRGlu in a homogeneous manner as well as in different ways, which are probably region dependent and illness related. The role of the stimulation coil placement site should be taken into account.", "pages": "99-102"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of both subthalamic nucleus and internal globus pallidus restores intracortical inhibition in Parkinson's disease paralleling apomorphine effects: a paired magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11801431", "authors": ["Pierantozzi, M", "Palmieri, MG", "Mazzone, P", "Marciani, MG", "Rossini, PM", "Stefani, A", "Giacomini, P", "Peppe, A", "Stanzione, P"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To determine whether intracortical inhibition and the conditioned blink reflex R2 inhibition correlate in healthy subjects.", "pages": "99-102"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Corticospinal volleys and compound muscle action potentials produced by repetitive transcranial stimulation during spinal surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11801428", "authors": ["Bartley, K", "Woodforth, IJ", "Stephen, JP", "Burke, D"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease and in focal dystonia the intracortical inhibition and the conditioned blink reflex R2 inhibition are abnormally weak.", "pages": "99-102"}]
