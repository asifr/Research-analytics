It has been theorized that there is a causal neural mechanism by which the CEN/SN negatively regulate the DMN. Support for this idea has come from correlational neuroimaging studies; however, direct evidence for this neural mechanism is lacking. Here we undertook a direct test of this mechanism by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with functional MRI to causally excite or inhibit TMS-accessible prefrontal nodes within the CEN or SN and determine consequent effects on the DMN. Single-pulse excitatory stimulations delivered to only the CEN node induced negative DMN connectivity with the CEN and SN, consistent with the CEN/SN's hypothesized negative regulation of the DMN. Conversely, low-frequency inhibitory repetitive TMS to the CEN node resulted in a shift of DMN signal from its normally low-frequency range to a higher frequency, suggesting disinhibition of DMN activity. Moreover, the CEN node exhibited this causal regulatory relationship primarily with the medial prefrontal portion of the DMN. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the causal mechanisms by which major brain networks normally coordinate information processing. Given that poorly regulated information processing is a hallmark of most neuropsychiatric disorders, these findings provide a foundation for ways to study network dysregulation and develop brain stimulation treatments for these disorders.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "A Computational Modelling Study of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Montages used in Depression.", "keywords": ["computational model", "depression", "transcranial direct current stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24246487", "authors": ["Bai, S", "Dokos, S", "Ho, KA", "Loo, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique which involves passing a mild electric current to the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. Several clinical studies suggest that tDCS may have clinically meaningful efficacy in the treatment of depression. The objective of this study was to simulate and compare the effects of several tDCS montages either used in clinical trials or proposed, for the treatment of depression, in different high-resolution anatomically-accurate head models. Detailed segmented finite element head models of two subjects were presented, and a total of eleven tDCS electrode montages were simulated. Sensitivity analysis on effects of changing the size of the anode, rotating both electrodes and displacing the anode was also conducted on selected montages. The F3-F8 and F3-F4 montages have been used in clinical trials reporting significant antidepressant effects and both result in relatively high electric fields in dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Other montages using a fronto-extracephalic or fronto-occipital approach result in greater stimulation of central structures (eg anterior cingulate cortex) which may be advantageous in treating depression, but their efficacy hasyet to be tested in randomised controlled trials. Results from sensitivity analysis suggest that electrode position and size may be adjusted slightly to accommodate other priorities, such as skin discomfort and damage.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "A new alarm point of transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials for intraoperative spinal cord monitoring: a prospective multicenter study from the Spinal Cord Monitoring Working Group of the Japanese Society for Spine Surgery and Related Research.", "keywords": ["Aphasia", "Electrical stimulation therapy", "Stroke", "Transcranial direct current stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24236669", "authors": ["Kobayashi, S", "Matsuyama, Y", "Shinomiya, K", "Kawabata, S", "Ando, M", "Kanchiku, T", "Saito, T", "Takahashi, M", "Ito, Z", "Muramoto, A", "Fujiwara, Y", "Kida, K", "Yamada, K", "Wada, K", "Yamamoto, N", "Satomi, K", "Tani, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery. Spine", "abstract": "Object Although multimodal intraoperative spinal cord monitoring provides greater accuracy, transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (TcMEP) monitoring became the gold standard for intraoperative spinal cord monitoring. However, there is no definite alarm point for TcMEPs because a multicenter study is lacking. Thus, based on their experience with 48 true-positive cases (that is, a decrease in potentials followed by a new neurological motor deficit postoperatively) encountered between 2007 and 2009, the authors set a 70% decrease in amplitude as the alarm point for TcMEPs. Methods A total of 959 cases of spinal deformity, spinal cord tumor, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) treated between 2010 and 2012 are included in this prospective multicenter study (18 institutions). These institutions are part of the Japanese Society for Spine Surgery and Related Research monitoring working group and the study group on spinal ligament ossification. The authors prospectively analyzed TcMEP variability and pre- and postoperative motor deficits. A 70% decrease in amplitude was designated as the alarm point. Results There were only 2 false-negative cases, which occurred during surgery for intramedullary spinal cord tumors. This new alarm criterion provided high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (91%) for intraoperative spinal cord monitoring and favorable accuracy, except in cases of intramedullary spinal cord tumor. Conclusions This study is the first prospective multicenter study to investigate the alarm point of TcMEPs. The authors recommend the designation of an alarm point of a 70% decrease in amplitude for routine spinal cord monitoring, particularly during surgery for spinal deformity, OPLL, and extramedullary spinal cord tumor.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Effects of dual transcranial direct current stimulation for aphasia in chronic stroke patients.", "keywords": ["Chronic pain", "clinical trial", "motor cortex", "neuropathic pain", "transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)"], "issue": "5", "pmid": "24233579", "authors": ["Lee, SY", "Cheon, HJ", "Yoon, KJ", "Chang, WH", "Kim, YH"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Annals of rehabilitation medicine", "abstract": "To investigate any additional effect of dual transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) compared with single tDCS in chronic stroke patients with aphasia.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Non-invasive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the Motor Cortex for Neuropathic Pain-At the Tipping Point?", "keywords": ["Coil orientation", "DTI", "Diffusion MRI tractography", "Electromagnetic modeling", "MRI", "Navigation", "TMS", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation", "diffusion tensor imaging", "magnetic resonance imaging", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "issue": "4", "pmid": "24228166", "authors": ["Treister, R", "Lang, M", "Klein, MM", "Oaklander, AL"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Rambam Maimonides medical journal", "abstract": "Eleven chronic stroke patients (aged 52.6\u00b113.4 years, nine men) with aphasia were enrolled.

Neuropathic pain is common, complicating diabetes, shingles, HIV, and cancer. Medications are often ineffective or cause various adverse effects, so better approaches are needed. Half a century ago, electrical stimulation of specific brain regions (neuromodulation) was demonstrated to relieve refractory NP without distant effects, but the need for surgical electrode implantation limited use of deep brain stimulation. Next, electrodes applied to the dura outside the brain's surface to stimulate the motor cortex were shown to relieve NP less invasively. Now, electromagnetic induction permits cortical neurons to be stimulated entirely non-invasively using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Repeated sessions of many TMS pulses (rTMS) can trigger neuronal plasticity to produce long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Repeated TMS already has US and European regulatory approval for treating refractory depression, and multiple small studies report efficacy for neuropathic pain. Recent improvements include \"frameless stereotactic\" neuronavigation systems, in which patients' head MRIs allow TMS to be applied to precise underlying cortical targets, minimizing variability between sessions and patients, which may enhance efficacy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation appears poised for the larger trials necessary for regulatory approval of a NP indication. Since few clinicians are familiar with TMS, we review its theoretical basis and historical development, summarize the neuropathic pain trial results, and identify issues to resolve before large-scale clinical trials.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Central Fatigue Assessed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Ultratrail Running.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24195865", "authors": ["Temesi, J", "Rupp, T", "Martin, V", "Arnal, PJ", "F\u00e9asson, L", "Verges, S", "Millet, GY"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Medicine and science in sports and exercise", "abstract": "TMS activations of white matter depend not only on the distance from the coil, but also on the orientation of the axons relative to the TMS-induced electric field, and especially on axonal bends that create strong local field gradient maxima.
