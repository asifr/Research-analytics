Minimal (n=2, within 80% attenuation of amplitude) or no changes (n=2) were observed after total resection of the schwannoma and no apparent motor weakness occurred in these 4 patients. In a patient with cervical schwannoma involved in C8 nerve root, CMAPs with large amplitude were recorded after stimulation of the C8 nerve root. SNAPs after stimulation of digit V were recorded with larger amplitude from the T1 root compared with those recorded from the C8 nerve root. Intradural parts of the tumor arising from C8 posterior rootlets were completely removed after transaction of posterior rootlets. During removal of intraforaminal parts of the tumor, motor evoked potentials were decreased over 50% of controls. Incomplete removal was chosen to avoid deterioration of motor function.

The contributors to this supplement present data and synthesize the extant literature on the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, optical imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation to study remodeling of cortical representation of motor and cognitive abilities after stroke and other etiologies of neurologic impairment. In general, the collective findings of these studies support use-dependent neuroplasticity as a mechanism of recovery and response to training. Brain imaging findings support the role of training effects on increased activation of brain regions ipsilateral to unilateral vascular lesions in facilitating recovery from stroke. The articles in this supplement also report the potential therapeutic application of stimulation techniques to enhance reorganization of function.", "pages": "571-6"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Monitoring of muscle motor evoked potentials during cerebral aneurysm surgery: intraoperative changes and postoperative outcome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17123730", "authors": ["Szel\u00e9nyi, A", "Langer, D", "Kothbauer, K", "De Camargo, AB", "Flamm, ES", "Deletis, V"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "In the voluntary contractions, output force can be maintained constant although the inhibitory influences exerted by pain on muscle activity. We investigated changes in the spontaneous and evoked activity of the abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM) and the biceps brachii muscle (BIC) in healthy volunteers during constant force noxious contraction, resulting from chemically activated nociceptive afferents. EMG-force relationship, motor-evoked response (MEP) to transcranial magnetic stimulation and determinism (DET) of surface EMG signals during constant force contraction was analyzed before, during and after chemically induced tonic activation of their nociceptive afferents. Under constant force contraction, amplitude of surface EMG signal decreased in BIC and increased in ADM during pain with respect to control condition. In both muscles, the size of motor-evoked potential (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was significantly higher during pain than in control. Level of determinism extracted from surface EMG signal by non-linear method was similarly and significantly increased in both muscles during pain stimulation. Finally, nociceptive stimulation caused a decline in steadiness of the force exerted by ADM and BIC. These results are interpreted in terms of increased corticospinal synchronizing inputs. The possibility that it may play a role in governing force production to counteract pain inhibitory influences on motor system is considered.", "pages": "571-6"}, {"volume": "204", "title": "Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation coupled with repetitive electrical stimulation on cortical spreading depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17121127", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Liebetanz, D", "Monte-Silva, KK", "Oliveira, MB", "Santos, AA", "Nitsche, MA", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Guedes, RC"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by dysfunctional brain activity.
