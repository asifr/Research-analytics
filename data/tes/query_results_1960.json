Measurements of the input-output relation for biceps brachii motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained at rest and during voluntary contraction in the course of the training. The training paradigms induced specific changes in the motor performance capacity of the subjects. The strength training group increased maximal dynamic and isometric muscle strength by 31% (P < 0.001) and 12.5% (P = 0.045), respectively. The skill learning group improved skill performance significantly (P < 0.001). With one training bout, the only significant change in transcranial magnetic stimulation parameters was an increase in skill learning group maximal MEP level (MEP(max)) at rest (P = 0.02) for subjects performing skill training. With repeated skill training three times per week for 4 wk, MEP(max) increased and the minimal stimulation intensity required to elicit MEPs decreased significantly at rest and during contraction (P < 0.05). In contrast, MEP(max) and the slope of the input-output relation both decreased significantly at rest but not during contraction in the strength-trained subjects (P < or = 0.01). No significant changes were observed in a control group. A significant correlation between changes in neurophysiological parameters and motor performance was observed for skill learning but not strength training. The data show that increased corticospinal excitability may develop over several weeks of skill training and indicate that these changes may be of importance for task acquisition. Because strength training was not accompanied by similar changes, the data suggest that different adaptive changes are involved in neural adaptation to strength training.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "[Design and field calculation of coil array for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) based on genetic algorithm].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15884540", "authors": ["Liu, J", "Huang, K", "Guo, L", "Zhang, H", "Hu, Y"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "abstract": "It is the intent of this paper to locate the activation point in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) efficiently.

Based on the calculated results of the optimized current configurations, ideal focusing capability is drawn as contour lines and 3-D mesh charts of magnitude of both magnetic and electric field within the calculation area.

The experiments were performed on 120 albino male Wistar rats, which were randomly allocated to four groups (n=30). (Thiopental, Thiopental+TCES, Thiopental+Remifentanil, and Thiopental+Remifentanil+TCES). Animals were anaesthetized with thiopental, and 15 min later, remifentanil was injected to rats in the Remifentanil groups. TCES was started in the stimulated groups 20 min after thiopental administration. Rats were stimulated 5 times for this experiment. The times for recovery, herein called Cognition Recovery Time and Motion Recovery Time were measured. Cognition Recovery and Motion Recovery Times were not affected by the stimulation. Analgesia was assessed using the wet tail-flick latency (TFL). In the Thiopental group, the analgesia level returned to control values on the 35th min. In the Thiopental+Remifentanil group, the analgesia level returned to control values on the 50th min. In the Thiopental+ TCES group, the analgesia level reached the peak value on the 65th min. In the Thiopental+Remifentanil+TCES group, the analgesia level reached the peak value on the 35th min and analgesia remained high during the 90 min after cessation of the stimulation. The analgesic potency for the Thiopental+Remifentanil+TCES group was increased by 30-40% when compared with the prior TFL values, 160% when compared with the control group, and 50-75% when compared with Thiopental+TCES group on the 35th min (P<0.001). In conclusion, TCES markedly decreases the anaesthetic and analgesic requirements for thiopental and remifentanil in rats.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "[The design of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system and its implementation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15875686", "authors": ["Wu, CZ", "Yu, Y", "Huo, XL"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi = Chinese journal of medical instrumentation", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic technigue.

During the early period following kindling (24 h from the last dose of epileptogen), animals showed decreases in measures of investigative behavior as measured in an open field test, along with reductions in sexual and feeding behavior. The severity of these impairments had decreased by two weeks from the last picrotoxin dose. Both treatment with L-DOPA (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (20 impulses with induction, peak 1.5 T) were accompanied by increases in measures of investigative, sexual, and feeding behavior in the animals, suggesting that mechanism of action of transcranial magnetic stimulation in relation to kindling-induced behavioral abnormalities is mediated by activation of the dopaminergic system of the brain.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on interhemispheric inhibition.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15872061", "authors": ["Pal, PK", "Hanajima, R", "Gunraj, CA", "Li, JY", "Wagle-Shukla, A", "Morgante, F", "Chen, R"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "We studied the effects of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the excitability of interhemispheric connections in 13 right-handed healthy volunteers. TMS was performed using figure-eight coils, and surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from both first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. A paired-pulse method with a conditioning stimulus (CS) to the motor cortex (M1) followed by a test stimulus to the opposite M1 was used to study the interhemispheric inhibition (ppIHI). Both CS and TS were adjusted to produce motor-evoked potentials of approximately 1 mV in the contralateral FDI muscles. After baseline measurement of right-to-left IHI (pre-RIHI) and left-to-right IHI (pre-LIHI), rTMS was applied over left M1 at 1 Hz with 900 stimuli at 115% of resting motor threshold. After rTMS, ppIHI was studied using both the pre-rTMS CS (post-RIHI and post-LIHI) and an adjusted post-rTMS CS set to produce 1-mV motor evoked potentials (MEPs; post-RIHI(adj) and post-LIHI(adj)). The TS was set to produce 1-mV MEPs. There was a significant reduction in post-LIHI (P = 0.0049) and post-LIHI(adj) (P = 0.0169) compared with pre-LIHI at both interstimulus intervals of 10 and 40 ms. Post-RIHI was significantly reduced compared with pre-RIHI (P = 0.0015) but pre-RIHI and post-RIHI(adj) were not significantly different. We conclude that 1-Hz rTMS reduces IHI in both directions but is predominantly from the stimulated to the unstimulated hemisphere. Low-frequency rTMS may be used to modulate the excitability of IHI circuits. Treatment protocols using low-frequency rTMS to reduce cortical excitability in neurological and psychiatric conditions need to take into account their effects on IHI.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Right-hemisphere motor facilitation by self-descriptive personality-trait words.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "16105952", "authors": ["Molnar-Szakacs, I", "Uddin, LQ", "Iacoboni, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The emergent picture from the literature on the processing of self-related information suggests that in addition to the neural mechanisms involved in recognizing one's own face, there may also be neural representations of the self that are modality independent and favour the right hemisphere. We used focal, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in human subjects to assess cortical excitability during covert reading of self-descriptive personality-trait words. We hypothesized that the right hemisphere would show a greater overall facilitation to personality-trait words than the left hemisphere. Overall, personality-trait words led to significantly greater motor facilitation in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. In addition, words rated as 'never' self-characteristic yielded significant right hemisphere facilitation, and words rated as 'always' self-characteristic showed a similar trend. The results are discussed in terms of the notion that the right hemisphere plays a dominant role in both self-relevant processing and the processing of affective stimuli.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Somatotopic blocking of sensation with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15869493", "authors": ["Hannula, H", "Ylioja, S", "Pertovaara, A", "Korvenoja, A", "Ruohonen, J", "Ilmoniemi, RJ", "Carlson, S"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "We demonstrate that spatially accurate and selective stimulation is crucial when cortical functions are studied by the creation of temporary lesions with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Previously, the interpretation of the TMS results has been hampered by inaccurate knowledge of the site and strength of the induced electric current in the brain. With a Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) system, which provides real-time magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided targeting of the TMS-induced electric field, we found that TMS of a spatially restricted cortical S1 thenar area is sufficient to abolish sensation from a weak electric stimulation of the corresponding skin area. We demonstrate that with real-time navigation, TMS can be repeatably directed at millimeter-level precision to a target area defined on the MRI. The stimulation effect was temporally and spatially specific: the greatest inhibition of sensation occurred when TMS was applied 20 ms after the cutaneous test stimulus and the TMS effect was sensitive to 8-13 mm displacements of the induced electric field pattern. The results also indicate that TMS selectively to S1 is sufficient to abolish perception of cutaneous stimulation of the corresponding skin area.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "186", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15864816", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Boggio, PS", "Nitsche, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "Studies have compared electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with regard to clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression, but no study has yet addressed the differential impact on cognition.", "pages": "1558-68"}, {"volume": "186", "title": "Distinctive neurocognitive effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy in major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15863752", "authors": ["Schulze-Rauschenbach, SC", "Harms, U", "Schlaepfer, TE", "Maier, W", "Falkai, P", "Wagner, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "To compare the neurocognitive effects of unilateral ECT and rTMS.", "pages": "1558-68"}]
