However, no human head model of sufficient complexity for studying the biophysics under these circumstances has been developed which utilizes structures at both the regional and cellular levels and provides well-defined smooth boundaries between tissues of different conductivities and orientations. The main barrier for building such accurate head models is the complex modeling procedures that include 3D object reconstruction and optimized meshing. In this study, a structurally detailed finite element model of the human head was generated that includes details to the level of cerebral gyri and sulci by combining computed tomography and magnetic resonance images. Furthermore, cortical columns that contain conductive processes of pyramidal neurons traversing the neocortical layers were included in the head model thus providing structure at or near the cellular level. These refinements provide a much more realistic model to investigate the effects of TMS on brain electrophysiology in the neocortex.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "66", "title": "Serotonin affects transcranial direct current-induced neuroplasticity in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "19427633", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Kuo, MF", "Karrasch, R", "W\u00e4chter, B", "Liebetanz, D", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Modulation of the serotonergic system affects long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the likely neurophysiologic derivates of learning and memory formation, in animals and slice preparations.
