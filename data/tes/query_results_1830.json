The intriguing symptom is a spontaneous orientation bias towards the right leading to neglect of objects or persons on the left. Interestingly, we observe similar symptoms namely a spontaneous bias of eyes and head along the horizontal dimension of space in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction. Further similarities concern anatomical findings. Both spatial neglect and vestibular processing at cortical level show dominance in the right hemisphere and involve common brain areas. Lesion studies in human and monkey, electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulation, as well as functional imaging results have revealed the superior temporal cortex, insula and the temporo-parietal junction to be substantial parts of the multisensory (vestibular) system as well as to be affected in spatial neglect. We argue that these structures are not strictly 'vestibular' but rather have a multimodal character representing a significant site for the neural transformation of converging vestibular, auditory, neck proprioceptive and visual input into higher order spatial representations. Neurons of these regions provide us with redundant information about the position and motion of our body in space. They seem to play an essential role in adjusting body position relative to external space. This view may initiate further development of those strategies to treat spatial neglect that use routes to rehabilitation based on specific manipulations of sensory input feeding into this system.", "pages": "293-305"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "Modulatory effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the ipsilateral silent period.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16369790", "authors": ["Cincotta, M", "Giovannelli, F", "Borgheresi, A", "Balestrieri, F", "Zaccara, G", "Inghilleri, M", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

This progressive lengthening probably reflects temporal summation of the inhibitory interneurons in the stimulated primary motor cortex (M1). In this study, we tested whether high-frequency rTMS also modulates the ipsilateral silent period (ISP). In nine normal subjects, suprathreshold 10-pulse rTMS trains were delivered to the right M1 at frequencies of 3, 5, and 10 Hz during maximal isometric contraction of both first dorsal interosseous muscles. At 10 Hz, the second pulse of the train increased the area of the ISP; the other stimuli did not increase it further. During rTMS at 3 and 5 Hz, the ISP remained significantly unchanged. Control experiments showed that 10-Hz rTMS delivered at subthreshold intensity also increased the ISP. rTMS over the hand motor area did not facilitate ISPs in the biceps muscles. Finally, rTMS-induced ISP facilitation did not outlast the 10-Hz rTMS train. These findings suggest that rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz potentiates the interhemispheric inhibitory mechanisms responsible for the ISP, partly through temporal summation. The distinct changes in the ISP and CSP suggest that rTMS facilitates intrahemispheric and interhemispheric inhibitory phenomena through separate neural mechanisms. The ISP facilitation induced by high-frequency rTMS is a novel, promising tool to investigate pathophysiological abnormal interhemispheric inhibitory transfer in various neurological diseases.", "pages": "293-305"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Cortical hemoglobin-concentration changes under the coil induced by single-pulse TMS in humans: a simultaneous recording with near-infrared spectroscopy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16328307", "authors": ["Mochizuki, H", "Ugawa, Y", "Terao, Y", "Sakai, KL"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Single-pulse TMS was delivered over the hand area of the left primary motor cortex at an intensity of 100, 120, or 140% of the active motor threshold (AMT). NIRS recordings were also made during sham stimulation. These four different stimulation sessions (TMS at three intensities and sham stimulation) were performed both when the subject slightly contracted the right first dorsal interosseous muscle and when relaxed it (active and resting conditions). Under the active condition with TMS at 100% AMT, we observed a transient increase in oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb), which was significantly larger than sham stimulation. Under the resting conditions with TMS at 120 and 140% AMT, we observed significant decreases in both deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxyHb) and total-hemoglobin (total-Hb) as compared to sham stimulation. We suggest that the increase of oxy-Hb concentration at 100% AMT under the active condition reflects an add-on effect by TMS to the active baseline and that decrease of deoxy-Hb and total-Hb concentrations at 120 and 140% AMT under the resting condition are due to reduced baseline firings of the corticospinal tract neurons induced by a lasting inhibition provoked by a higher intensity TMS.", "pages": "293-305"}, {"volume": "170", "title": "Afferent stimulation facilitates performance on a novel motor task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16328288", "authors": ["McDonnell, MN", "Ridding, MC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Moreover, periods of afferent stimulation result in increased motor cortex excitability. There is increasing evidence to suggest that raised motor cortical excitability may facilitate movement and learning. Here we examined whether a period of electrical stimulation of hand afferents (\"associative stimulation\"), known to increase motor cortex excitability, facilitated the performance of a complex sensorimotor task. Three groups of nine normal subjects participated in these studies. All subjects were trained on the grooved pegboard test (GPT). Training consisted of three blocks, each of five trials, of placing pegs as quickly as possible. The time to complete each block was recorded. One group of subjects had a 1-h period of associative stimulation prior to training on the GPT. A second group received non-associative stimulation (which does not change cortical excitability) of the same hand afferents while a third group received no stimulation prior to training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimus (ADM) muscles both prior to and following stimulation and performance of the GPT. In contrast to non-associative stimulation, associative stimulation increased motor cortical excitability, as evidenced by an increase in the amplitude of MEPs evoked in the FDI, one of the stimulated muscles, but not the ADM. Training on the GPT resulted in significant improvements in the time taken to complete the task for all three groups. However, in subjects who had preconditioning associative stimulation, performance on the GPT improved more rapidly. Additionally, there was a strong trend for the improvement in the performance of the stimulated group to be greater than that of the control group. The results of the present study suggest that increased motor cortical excitability, induced by associative stimulation, may facilitate the performance of a novel complex sensorimotor task.", "pages": "293-305"}, {"volume": "170", "title": "Subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation during the long latency component of the cutaneomotor reflex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16328266", "authors": ["Stuart, M", "Taylor, JL"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Several groups have attempted to establish a role for the motor cortex in the generation of the facilitatory component of the cutaneomotor reflex. Our aim was to establish if the facilitatory component of the reflex could be diminished by a procedure known to inhibit the motor cortex, namely, subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation. During sustained small contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS), which were subthreshold for the generation of a motor evoked potential, were delivered via a figure-of-eight coil. Inhibition of ongoing EMG was observed in all subjects. In two separate series of trials, TMS was timed so that the resultant inhibition occurred coincident with either the short or long latency stretch reflex or with the initial or later part of the facilitatory component of the cutaneomotor reflex. The short latency stretch reflex is known to involve a largely monosynaptic loop via the spinal cord, whereas the long latency response involves a transcortical loop. The long latency response was reduced in size following subthreshold TMS, whereas the short latency response was unchanged. This provides evidence of the effectiveness of subthreshold TMS in inhibiting a transcortical reflex. When the TMS was timed so that the inhibition occurred coincident with the facilitatory component of the cutaneomotor response, neither the early nor later changes were inhibited. Thus, the pathway of the long-latency cutaneomotor reflex is not similar to the transcortical pathway of the stretch reflex. Either the response does not travel via the cortex or it involves different cortical neurones.", "pages": "293-305"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Landiolol and esmolol prevent tachycardia without altering cerebral blood flow.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "16326671", "authors": ["Saito, S", "Nishihara, F", "Akihiro, T", "Nishikawa, K", "Obata, H", "Goto, F", "Yuki, N"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesth\u00e9sie", "abstract": "Several ss-adrenergic-blocking drugs have been used during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to stabilize the hemodynamic alterations following electrical stimulation.

A main projection from the cerebellum to the primary motor cortex is a disynaptic excitatory pathway relayed at the ventral thalamus. This dentatothalamocortical pathway receives inhibitory inputs from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. These pathways (cerebellothalamocortical pathways) have been characterized extensively using cellular approaches in animals. Advances in non-invasive transcranial activation of neural structures using electrical and magnetic stimulation have allowed us to investigate these neural connections in humans. This review summarizes various studies of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway in humans using current transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation techniques. We studied effects on motor cortical excitability elicited by electrical or magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum by recording surface electromyographic (EMG) responses from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Magnetic stimuli were given with a round or figure eight coil (test stimulation) for primary motor cortical activation. For cerebellar stimulation, we gave high-voltage electrical stimuli or magnetic stimuli through a cone-shaped coil ipsilateral to the surface EMG recording (conditioning stimulation). We examined effects of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) with randomized condition-test paradigm, using a test stimulus given preceded by a conditioning stimulus by ISIs of several milliseconds. We demonstrated significant gain of EMG responses at an ISI of 3 ms (facilitatory effect) and reduced responses starting at 5 ms, which lasted 3-7 ms (inhibitory effect). We applied this method to patients with ataxia and showed that the inhibitory effect was only absent in patients with a lesion at cerebellar efferent pathways or dentatothalamocortical pathway. These results imply that this method activates the unilateral cerebellar structures. We confirmed facilitatory and inhibitory natures of cerebellothalamocortical pathways in humans. We can differentiate ataxia attributable to somewhere in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways from that caused by other pathways.", "pages": "293-305"}]
