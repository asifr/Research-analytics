This phenomenon is known as figural or face after-effect. Although currently the topic of face adaptation enjoys utmost popularity, we still don't know much about the neural process underlying it. The aim of the present study was to determine, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), how the retinotopically organised primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-level, non-retinotopic right lateral temporo-parietal areas interact with facial adaptation processing. Seventeen healthy subjects received 10 min anodal, cathodal or sham stimulation over these areas during a facial adaptation task. Cathodal stimulation of the right temporo-parietal cortex reduces the magnitude of facial adaptation while stimulation over the V1 results in no significant effects. These data imply that mainly lateral temporo-parietal cortical areas play role in facial adaptation and in facial gender discrimination, supporting the idea that the observed after-effects are the result of high-level, configurational adaptation mechanisms.", "pages": "474-9"}, {"volume": "186", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation on posterior parietal cortex disrupts visuo-spatial processing in the contralateral visual field.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "18196224", "authors": ["Schweid, L", "Rushmore, RJ", "Valero-Cabr\u00e9, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

While tDCS has been used to alter functions tied to primary motor and visual cortices, its impact on extrastriate visual areas involved in visuo-spatial processing has not yet been examined. In the current study, we applied tDCS to the cat visuoparietal (VP) cortex and assayed performance in a paradigm designed to assess the capacity to detect, localize and orient to static targets appearing at different spatial eccentricities within the visual field. Real or sham cathodal tDCS was unilaterally applied to the VP cortex, and orienting performance was assessed during (online), immediately after (offline; Experiments 1 and 2), and 1 or 24 h after the end of the tDCS stimulation (Experiment 2). Performance was compared to baseline data collected immediately prior to stimulation. Real, but not sham, tDCS induced significant decreases in performance for static visual targets presented in the contrastimulated visual hemifield. The behavioral impact of tDCS was most apparent during the online and immediate offline periods. The tDCS effect decayed progressively over time and performance returned to baseline levels approximately 60 min after stimulation. These results are consistent with the effects of both invasive and non-invasive deactivation methods applied to the same brain region, and indicate that tDCS has the potential to modify neuronal activity in extrastriate visual regions and to sculpt brain activity and behavior in normal and neurologically impaired subjects.", "pages": "474-9"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "Impaired transcallosally mediated motor inhibition in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is modulated by methylphenidate.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "18196200", "authors": ["Hoeppner, J", "Wandschneider, R", "Neumeyer, M", "Gierow, W", "Haessler, F", "Herpertz, SC", "Buchmann, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in children with ADHD, an impaired transcallosally mediated motor inhibition (ipsilateral silent period, iSP) was found, and its restoration was correlated with improvement of hyperactivity under medication with methylphenidate (MPH). Hyperactivity has been reported to decrease during transition into adulthood, although some motor dysfunction might persist. As one underlying neurophysiological process, a development-dependent normalization of motor cortical excitability might be postulated. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the iSP in 21 adult ADHD patients and twenty-one sex- and age-matched healthy controls. In 16 of these patients, a second TMS was performed under treatment with MPH. Our results indicate a persistence of impaired transcallosally mediated motor cortical inhibition (shortened duration) in ADHD adults, which was correlated with clinical characteristics of hyperactivity and restlessness, and was restored by MPH. In contrast to ADHD in childhood, the iSP latency was not impaired, suggesting a partial development-dependent normalization of motor cortical excitability in ADHD adults. ISP duration appears to be a sensitive parameter for the assessment of disturbed intercortical inhibition in adults with ADHD.", "pages": "474-9"}, {"volume": "186", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain atrophy: a computer-based human brain model study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "18193208", "authors": ["Wagner, T", "Eden, U", "Fregni, F", "Valero-Cabre, A", "Ramos-Estebanez, C", "Pronio-Stelluto, V", "Grodzinsky, A", "Zahn, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We compared the currents induced by various TMS conditions on several different MRI derived finite element head models of brain atrophy, incorporating both decreasing cortical volume and widened sulci. The current densities induced in the cortex were dependent upon the degree and type of cortical atrophy and were altered in magnitude, location, and orientation when compared to healthy head models. Predictive models of the degree of current density attenuation as a function of the scalp-to-cortex distance were analyzed, concluding that those which ignore the electromagnetic field-tissue interactions lead to inaccurate conclusions. Ultimately, the precise site and population of neural elements stimulated by TMS in an atrophic brain cannot be predicted based on healthy head models which ignore the effects of the altered cortex on the stimulating currents. Clinical applications of TMS should be carefully considered in light of these findings.", "pages": "474-9"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "Cholinergic dysfunction in subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "10378741", "authors": ["Nardone, R", "Bergmann, J", "Tezzon, F", "Ladurner, G", "Golaszewski, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Little is known about the neurochemical pathology of vascular dementia (VD); it was suggested that cholinergic mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of VD, as well as been established for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recently devised test of motor cortex excitability, the short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), has been proven to depend upon the activity of cholinergic circuits in the human brain. To evaluate, in vivo, the functional role of the cholinergic system in the cognitive dysfunction associated with VD, we used this test in 20 patients with subcortical ischemic VD (SIVD) and in 25 control subjects. Mean SAI was significantly reduced in the SIVD patients; however, individual data varied widely, with SAI responses ranging from normal to markedly reduced values. These findings provide physiological evidence for an important role for cholinergic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of VD. The evaluation of SAI, similar to that described in AD patients, could help in identifying those patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with cholinergic drugs.", "pages": "474-9"}, {"volume": "99", "title": "Spinal mechanisms contribute to differences in the time to failure of submaximal fatiguing contractions performed with different loads.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16418849", "authors": ["Klass, M", "L\u00e9v\u00e9nez, M", "Enoka, RM", "Duchateau, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study compared the mechanisms that limit the time to failure of a sustained submaximal contraction at 20% of maximum when the elbow flexors either supported an inertial load (position task) or exerted an equivalent constant torque against a rigid restraint (force task). The surface electromyogram (EMG), the motor-evoked potential (MEP) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex, and the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) and maximal M-wave (Mmax) elicited by electrical stimulation of the brachial plexus were recorded in biceps brachii during the two tasks. Although the time to failure for the position task was only 44% of that for the force task, the rate of increase of the average EMG (aEMG; % initial MVC) and MEP area (% Mmax) did not differ significantly during the two tasks. At task failure, however, the increases in normalized aEMG and MEP area were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the force task (36.4 and 219.9%) than for the position task (22.4 and 141.7%). Furthermore, the superimposed mechanical twitch (% initial MVC), evoked by TMS during a brief MVC of the elbow flexors immediately after task failure, was increased similarly in both tasks. Although the normalized H-reflex area (% Mmax) decreased during the two fatiguing contractions, the reduction was more rapid and greater during the position task (59.8%) compared with the force task (34.7%). Taken together, the results suggest that spinal mechanisms were a major determinant of the briefer time to failure for the position task.", "pages": "474-9"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation over somatosensory cortex decreases experimentally induced acute pain perception.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11459683", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Brepohl, N", "Poreisz, C", "Boros, K", "Csifcsak, G", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Clinical journal of pain", "abstract": "Multiple cortical areas including the primary somatosensory cortex are known to be involved in nociception.
