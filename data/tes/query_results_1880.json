Lorazepam, dextromethorphan or placebo was administered to 45 normal controls in a double-blind fashion 2.5 h before the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation procedure. Motor cortical excitability was measured with single transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses before and after 15 min of 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied at supra-threshold intensity. 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation resulted in a decrease in motor cortical excitability in the placebo group but not in the groups taking lorazepam or dextromethorphan. These results suggest that cortical responses to 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are dependent on activity at both gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-asparate receptor systems.", "pages": "1525-8"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Figure-ground segregation requires two distinct periods of activity in V1: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "13", "pmid": "16110276", "authors": ["Heinen, K", "Jolij, J", "Lamme, VA"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Discriminating objects from their surroundings by the visual system is known as figure-ground segregation.

High-frequency, subthreshold repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex was shown to be able to produce antalgic effects, at least transiently, in patients with chronic pain. Nevertheless, other cortical targets than the primary motor cortex are tempting (parietal or prefrontal areas for instance) for the management of pain and need to be studied. Motor cortex TMS was also found to modulate non-nociceptive sensory perception as well as acutely provoked pain in healthy subjects by means of a single conditioning pulse or repeated trains. On the contrary, spontaneous or provoked pain was shown to modify motor cortex excitability, as assessed by TMS technique. Taking into account all these observations, it appears that motor cortex function and pain process are closely related and that TMS is a potent tool to explore and to understand this relationship. Beyond this physiological purpose, rTMS could be useful to control episodes of neurogenic pain of limited duration or to select patients for the surgical implantation of a cortical stimulator.", "pages": "1525-8"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Outlasting excitability shifts induced by direct current stimulation of the human brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "16106673", "authors": ["Paulus, W"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "tDCS appears to be a promising tool in neuroplasticity research with some perspectives in clinical neurophysiology. It is closely related to modulation of cortical excitability and activity which are key mechanisms for modulating neuroplasticity. Long-term potentiation and long-term depression-like effects have been shown to be involved in learning processes in animal studies so far. Stimulation with weak direct currents is capable of inducing stimulation-polarity-dependent, prolonged, diminutions or elevations of cortical activity and excitability, most probably elicited by a hyper- or depolarisation of resting membrane potentials. Moreover, these modulations are functionally important, since they affect learning processes and epileptic activity. Here excitability changes have been accomplished in the human by non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). They share some important features with these well-known neuroplastic changes: The duration of the effects depends on stimulation duration and intensity, they are of intracortical origin, and the prolonged effects depend on NMDA-receptor activity. Thus, this technique is a promising method in the field of neuroplastic research in animals and humans and could evolve as a therapeutic tool in some neuro-psychiatric disorders which benefit from modulation of cortical excitability.", "pages": "1525-8"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Paired associative stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "16106657", "authors": ["Classen, J", "Wolters, A", "Stefan, K", "Wycislo, M", "Sandbrink, F", "Schmidt, A", "Kunesch, E"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Paired associative stimulation (PAS) refers to a paradigm consisting of slow-rate repetitive low-frequency median nerve stimulation combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex.

Its principles of design were shaped after associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in experimental animals, a cellular mechanism likely to be relevant for learning and memory. PAS-induced changes of cortical excitability share a number of physiological properties with LTP. Of particular importance is the fact that the sign of PAS-induced changes of the size of amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) depends on the exact interval between the afferent and the magnetic pulse during the intervention. A number of observations suggest that PAS-induced excitability changes may have functional significance. PAS-induced plasticity may contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of neurological disorders where neuroplasticity is thought to have a pathogenetic role.

We investigated whether this could be due to a remodeling of somatosensory cortical areas during vision of the body. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered over the primary and secondary somatosensory areas of subjects who showed clear visual-tactile enhancement while they performed a tactile grating discrimination task. Before the tactile stimulus, subjects viewed either their right index finger through a semisilvered mirror or an object reflected by the mirror and positioned to appear in the same location as the finger. In a first experiment we observed that TMS over primary somatosensory cortex significantly reduced subjects' accuracy whilst viewing the hand. No such reduction was found when subjects viewed a neutral object. In a second experiment, we disrupted the activity of primary and secondary somatosensory areas in different sessions. When stimulating the primary somatosensory cortex, a reduction in accuracy was again found while viewing the hand, but not a neutral object. TMS over secondary somatosensory cortex had no effect in any condition.

To exclude effects of muscle relaxants on TCMEP, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) by supramaximum stimulation of the median nerve immediately after transcranial stimulation (300 to 600 V) was recorded in 70 neurosurgical operations. A relative amplitude index (RAI) was defined as the amplitude of TCMEP after the operative procedure divided by the amplitude of TCMEP before the operative procedure. The RAI was calculated and was compensated by the amplitude of CMAP in 141 limbs. In 12 limbs of 7 patients with postoperatively progressed motor paresis, the compensated RAI was less than 0.2. The compensated RAI in all other 129 limbs of 63 patients without postoperative motor palsy was more than 0.2.

The aims of the present study were to assess the central motor innervation of the tongue in normal adults using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and to compare this with that seen in stroke patients with or without dysarthria. The study included 46 patients with acute monohemispheric stroke due to occlusion of the territory of the middle cerebral artery as documented by CT brain scan (26 patients with dysarthria and 20 patients without dysarthria). Forty-five (age and sex matched) normal volunteers served as controls. Corticolingual pathways were assessed for each subject after TMS of each hemisphere. TMS over the motor cortex of healthy subjects elicited consistent ipsilateral and contralateral lingual responses. The ipsilateral response was usually smaller and approximately 73% of the amplitude of the contralateral response. The cross talk between the two halves of the tongue as estimated after unilateral electrical stimulation of hypoglossal nerve gave a contra/ipsi ratio of 36%, which was significantly smaller than the ratio seen after cortical stimulation (CL). For the patients, with or without dysarthria, motor evoked potential (MEP) latencies (ipsilateral and contralateral) were significantly prolonged after stimulation of affected hemisphere compared with the non-affected hemisphere or the control group (P< 0.001). MEP amplitudes were significantly smaller in hemiplegic patients with dysarthria compared to patients without dysarthria. In patients without dysarthria stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere tended to evoke responses that were of similar size on both sides. There were no significant associations between neurophysiological parameters and side of infarction. We conclude that interruption of the corticolingual pathways is frequent in stroke patients with or without dysarthria.
