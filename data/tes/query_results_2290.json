Owing to this extension of life, some pathological processes that formerly were considered to exhibit low prevalence now have become top priorities for public health programs. Among these pathological processes, cognitive diseases stand out, the two most frequent being Alzheimer's disease and cognitive disorders of vascular etiology, for which humans are at increased risk beyond age 65. We studied 120 adults with cognitive disorders representing a variety of etiologies. We performed a comparative statistical study between members of this group of patients and a group of general patients by means of different neurophysiological examinations: acoustically evoked potentials, P300, brain electrical activity mapping both in the resting state and under complex stimulation, and Doppler ultrasonographic extracranial and transcranial assessment. The comparative study between both populations revealed significant differences in results of the various tests. Neurotransmitter equilibrium (dopamine, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], etc.) in the areas of the cerebral cortex related to cognitive disorders is essential in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.", "pages": "104-7"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Consecutive transcranial magnetic stimulation: phosphene thresholds in migraineurs and controls.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "14756850", "authors": ["Young, WB", "Oshinsky, ML", "Shechter, AL", "Gebeline-Myers, C", "Bradley, KC", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Headache", "abstract": "To characterize the temporal course of transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced phosphene thresholds in subjects with migraine and in controls.", "pages": "104-7"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "[Effects of L-dopa and transcranial magnetic stimulation on behavioral reactions in kindled rats].", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "14758631", "authors": ["Godlevski\u012d, LS", "Kobolev, EV"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Rossi\u012dskii fiziologicheski\u012d zhurnal imeni I.M.

We measured electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to motor-cortex TMS, estimated the intensity dependence of the overall brain response, and compared it to a theoretical model for the intensity dependence of the TMS-evoked neuronal activity. Left and right motor cortices of seven volunteers were stimulated at intensities of 60, 80, 100, and 120% of the motor threshold (MT). A figure-of-eight coil (diameter of each loop 4 cm) was used for focal stimulation. EEG was recorded with 60 scalp electrodes. The intensity of 60% of MT was sufficient to produce a distinct global mean field amplitude (GMFA) waveform in all subjects. The GMFA, reflecting the overall brain response, was composed of four peaks, appearing at 15 +/- 5 msec (Peak I), 44 +/- 10 msec (II), 102 +/- 18 msec (III), and 185 +/- 13 msec (IV). The peak amplitudes depended nonlinearly on intensity. This nonlinearity was most pronounced for Peaks I and II, whose amplitudes appeared to sample the initial part of the sigmoid-shaped curve modeling the strength of TMS-evoked neuronal activity. Although the response amplitude increased with stimulus intensity, scalp distributions of the potential were relatively similar for the four intensities. The results imply that TMS is able to evoke measurable brain activity at low stimulus intensities, probably significantly below 60% of MT. The shape of the response-stimulus intensity curve may be an indicator of the activation state of the brain.", "pages": "104-7"}, {"volume": "356", "title": "Sustained increase of somatosensory cortex excitability by 5 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studied by paired median nerve stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12627757", "authors": ["Ragert, P", "Becker, M", "Tegenthoff, M", "Pleger, B", "Dinse, HR"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "It has been claimed that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human motor cortex can produce a sense of movement of the contralateral hand, even when the hand is paralysed. The sense of movement was equated with a 'corollary discharge', a nulling mechanism originally posited for maintaining constancy of the visual field during eye movements. Our experiments were designed to test whether the sensation that accompanies TMS-evoked finger movements is generated centrally or whether it arises as a result of sensory feedback. Matched twitches of the left and right fingers were elicited either by bilateral electrical stimulation of forearm extensor muscles, or by a combination of TMS of left motor cortex (eliciting twitches of the right forefinger), and electrical stimulation of the left forearm muscles (eliciting twitches of the left forefinger). The time interval between stimuli activating left and right twitches was varied randomly (range +/- 90 ms) from trial to trial. Subjects reported whether they sensed that the left or the right movement occurred first, or if they could detect no difference. The left and right movements evoked by bilateral electrical stimulation of muscles were sensed as near simultaneous when there was zero delay between them. When TMS was applied in conjunction with unilateral muscle stimulation, the TMS-evoked movement was felt, on average, 20 ms after the movement evoked by muscle stimulation. Similar results were obtained when the skin under the cathodal electrodes was anaesthetized. Since the TMS-evoked movements were felt later rather than earlier than the electrically evoked movements, the results do not support the idea that the sensation of movement was elicited centrally by TMS. Rather, they favour sensory feedback as the source of the sense of movement. The earlier perception of electrically evoked versus TMS-evoked movements was probably due to earlier sensory responses in the periphery rather than a suppression of the excitability of somatosensory cortex.", "pages": "104-7"}, {"volume": "356", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex attenuates pain perception in complex regional pain syndrome type I.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12694898", "authors": ["Pleger, B", "Janssen, F", "Schwenkreis, P", "V\u00f6lker, B", "Maier, C", "Tegenthoff, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Neural stimulation is a promising new technology for the treatment of medically-intractable seizures. Vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS) is licensed in several countries as an adjunctive therapy. VNS is as effective as antiepileptic drug therapy, and serious complications are rare. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is simple, non-invasive, and widely used in neurophysiology. Therapeutic results in a few studies are equivocal at best. Deep brain stimulation, although experimental, has been applied to the cerebellum, caudate nucleus, centromedian thalamus, anterior thalamus, subthalamus, hippocampus, and neocortical seizure foci. Preliminary results are encouraging, but not conclusive. Electrode implantation in the brain for indications other than seizures has been associated with a 5% risk for intracranial haemorrhage and 5% for infection.

However, little is known about the effects of TMS in other cortical areas such as the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Here we asked whether high-frequency (5 Hz) rTMS applied over the left SI evokes sustained changes in cortical excitability. To assess excitability changes, we applied a paired-pulse protocol consisting of paired electrical stimulation of the median nerve using an interstimulus interval of 30 ms and recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials. For ipsilateral SI we found that 1 h after termination of 5 Hz rTMS applied over the left SI with a figure-of-eight coil there was a sustained suppression of the normally present paired-pulse inhibition. Latencies and N20 amplitudes of the first peak remained unchanged. No changes of paired-pulse behavior were observed in the contralateral SI that was not TMS stimulated. The sustained excitability enhancement in SI is discussed in respect to previous findings regarding an improvement of tactile discrimination behavior by rTMS.", "pages": "104-7"}]
