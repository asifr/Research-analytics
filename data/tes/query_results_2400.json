In a first attempt, we performed extracellular single-unit recordings in the primary visual cortex (area 17) of the anaesthetised and paralysed cat, with the stimulating magnetic field centred at the recording site (2 x 70 mm figure-of-eight coil). The effect of single biphasic TMS pulses, which induce a lateral-to-medial electric current within the occipital pole of the right hemisphere, was tested for spontaneous as well as visually evoked activity. For cat visual cortex we found that a single TMS pulse elicited distinct episodes of enhanced and suppressed activity: in general, a facilitation of activity was found during the first 500 ms, followed thereafter by a suppression of activity lasting up to a few seconds. Strong stimuli exceeding 50 % of maximal stimulator output could also lead to an early suppression of activity during the first 100-200 ms, followed by stronger (rebound) facilitation. Early suppression and facilitation of activity may be related to a more or less direct stimulation of inhibitory and excitatory interneurons, probably with different thresholds. The late, long-lasting suppression is more likely to be related to metabotropic or metabolic processes, or even vascular responses. The time course of facilitation/inhibition may provide clues regarding the action of repetitive TMS application.", "pages": "665-79"}, {"volume": "96", "title": "Effects of exhaustive incremental treadmill exercise on diaphragm and quadriceps motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9437031", "authors": ["Verin, E", "Ross, E", "Demoule, A", "Hopkinson, N", "Nickol, A", "Fauroux, B", "Moxham, J", "Similowski, T", "Polkey, MI"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "It is unknown whether changes in corticomotor excitability follow exercise in healthy humans. We hypothesized that a fall in the diaphragm and quadriceps motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex would occur after an incremental exercise task. In 11 healthy subjects, we measured transdiaphragmatic pressure and isometric quadriceps tension in response to supramaximal peripheral magnetic nerve stimulation. MEPs were recorded from these muscles in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. After baseline measurements, subjects performed a period of submaximal exercise (gentle walking). Measurements were repeated 5 and 20 min after this. The subjects then exercised on a treadmill with an incremental protocol to exhaustion. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed at baseline and at 5, 20, 40, and 60 min after exhaustive exercise, and force measurements were obtained at baseline, 20 min, and 60 min. Mean exercise duration was 18 +/- 4 min, and mean maximum heart rate was 172 +/- 10 beats/min. Twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure and twitch isometric quadriceps tension were not different from baseline after exercise, but a significant decrease was observed in diaphragm MEP amplitude 5 and 20 min after exercise (60 +/- 38 and 45 +/- 24%, respectively, of baseline, P = 0.0001). At the same times, the mean quadriceps MEPs were 59 +/- 39 and 74 +/- 32% of baseline (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Studies using paired stimuli confirmed a likely intracortical mechanism for this depression.

The study showed the practical value of the combined TMS-EEG approach in differentiating between cortical and spinal-cord mechanisms, which is difficult with conventional electromyographic measures alone. TMS induced a pronounced negativity (N100) lasting for 150-200 ms, with the amplitude maximum in the stimulated hemisphere. When TMS was applied just before the onset of the visually triggered movement, N100 was markedly attenuated, although motor evoked potentials (MEPs) became larger. We suggest that the N100 component represents an inhibitory response following TMS. This interpretation is in agreement with intracellular recordings in animals, paired-pulse TMS studies and experiments showing increased premovement excitability on the basis of MEPs. N100 was not affected only by the subsequent movement, but also by the switching from rest to the motor-task condition, which caused a slight attenuation of the N100 component; no changes, however, were found in the amplitude of MEPs, suggesting that modified excitability did not affect the output of the corticospinal pyramidal cells. By contrast to MEPs, N100 was modulated also by the presentation of the visual stimulus alone, i.e. when no movement was required. This attenuation suggests that even in a rest condition visual stimuli have an access to the sensorimotor regions of the cortex, most probably through ascending arousal brain systems.", "pages": "665-79"}, {"volume": "349", "title": "Reorganization in the ipsilateral motor cortex of patients with lower limb amputation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9547074", "authors": ["Schwenkreis, P", "Pleger, B", "Cornelius, B", "Weyen, U", "Dertwinkel, R", "Zenz, M", "Malin, JP", "Tegenthoff, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to assess reorganization in the motor cortex of patients with lower limb amputation. We studied seven patients with traumatic lower limb amputation, and six healthy controls, using transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping, with recordings from the quadriceps femoris muscle on both sides. Motor threshold, sum of amplitudes, area and the amplitude-weighted centre of gravity (COG) of the motor output map were assessed. We found a significant lateral displacement of the COG on the hemisphere contralateral to the healthy leg, whereas other parameters did not differ significantly between sides. This finding might be indicative of cortical reorganization in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the amputation.

Anodal tDCS enhances and cathodal stimulation reduces excitability. Animal experiments have demonstrated that the effect of anodal tDCS is caused by neuronal depolarisation, while cathodal tDCS hyperpolarises cortical neurones. However, not much is known about the ion channels and receptors involved in these effects. Thus, the impact of the sodium channel blocker carbamazepine, the calcium channel blocker flunarizine and the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane on tDCS-elicited motor cortical excitability changes of healthy human subjects were tested. tDCS-protocols inducing excitability alterations (1) only during tDCS and (2) eliciting long-lasting after-effects were applied after drug administration. Carbamazepine selectively eliminated the excitability enhancement induced by anodal stimulation during and after tDCS. Flunarizine resulted in similar changes. Antagonising NMDA receptors did not alter current-generated excitability changes during a short stimulation, which elicits no after-effects, but prevented the induction of long-lasting after-effects independent of their direction. These results suggest that, like in other animals, cortical excitability shifts induced during tDCS in humans also depend on membrane polarisation, thus modulating the conductance of sodium and calcium channels. Moreover, they suggest that the after-effects may be NMDA receptor dependent. Since NMDA receptors are involved in neuroplastic changes, the results suggest a possible application of tDCS in the modulation or induction of these processes in a clinical setting. The selective elimination of tDCS-driven excitability enhancements by carbamazepine proposes a role for this drug in focussing the effects of cathodal tDCS, which may have important future clinical applications.", "pages": "665-79"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Cortical correlates of neuromotor development in healthy children.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "9751295", "authors": ["Garvey, MA", "Ziemann, U", "Bartko, JJ", "Denckla, MB", "Barker, CA", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To examine the relationship between acquisition of fine motor skills in childhood and development of the motor cortex.", "pages": "665-79"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Neurophysiological study of corticomotor pathways in restless legs syndrome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "9772114", "authors": ["Quatrale, R", "Manconi, M", "Gastaldo, E", "Eleopra, R", "Tugnoli, V", "Tola, MR", "Granieri, E"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We measured finger tapping speed and mirror movements in 43 healthy right-handed subjects (6-26 years of age).
