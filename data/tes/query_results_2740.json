Furthermore, a positive TMS effect on the ability to perform a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the quadriceps femoris muscle has been described. However, stimulus strength dependence and duration of this effect are currently unknown. In the present study these parameters of the TMS-induced MVC enhancement were investigated in seven healthy subjects. Initially, three repetitive transcranial magnetic stimuli of varying stimulus strength were applied every 4 s either during MVC or relaxation. Thereafter, MVC and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily (voluntary activation) were determined using a sensitive twitch interpolation technique. In a second experiment we investigated the effect of three transcranial magnetic stimuli applied either during MVC or during relaxation on MVC over a time period of 30 min. There was a small but significant and stimulus strength related positive effect of TMS on MVC. The effect of TMS on voluntary activation was not significant. TMS had to be given during MVC to be effective and the positive effect of TMS when applied during MVC was still present after 30 min. These results indicate that TMS acts differently on the motor cortex depending on its activation status. TMS might have potential therapeutic applications in diseases associated with diminished cortical motor drive and subsequent muscle weakness.", "pages": "25-31"}, {"volume": "72", "title": "[Contralateral and ipsilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Parkinson patients].", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "11789438", "authors": ["de Groot, M", "Hermann, W", "Steffen, J", "Wagner, A", "Grahmann, F"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Der Nervenarzt", "abstract": "In seven women and two men with Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 or 2, the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was evaluated.

Kinesiologic tests and writing samples were secondary outcome measures. After discontinuing all medication, stimulation was performed with 5 Hz at 90% of the motor threshold over the primary motor cortex of the more affected. There were 2250 stimuli applied, divided into 15 trains at intervals of 10 s. The identical treatment of the opposite side served as control treatment. Only treatment of the more affected side resulted in a significant improvement of the clinical symptoms of 46% as assessed by the UPDRS (p < 0.02). This effectiveness differed significantly from the control treatment (21%, p < 0.02). The kinesiological testing did not show any significant speeding of movements (p > 0.05). Some patients showed a normalisation of the previously disturbed handwriting specimen. These data confirm the previous observation that rTMS of primary motor regions leads to at least temporary clinical improvement of symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "25-31"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Use of transcranial micropolarization for treating tics in children and adolescents].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11785339", "authors": ["Kropotov, IuD", "Chuko, LS", "Grin'-Iatsenko, VA", "Iakovenko, EA", "Anisimova, TI", "Mnatsakanian, EG"], "year": "", "journal": "Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebno\u012d fizichesko\u012d kultury", "abstract": "Connections between the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex are dense and are important in the visual guidance of arm movements. We have shown previously that it is possible to engage these connections in humans and to measure the net amount of inhibition/facilitation from premotor to motor cortex using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The aim of this study was to test whether premotor activation can affect the excitability of circuits within the primary motor cortex (M1) itself. Repetitive TMS (rTMS), which is known to produce effects that outlast the train at the site of stimulation, was given for 20 min at 1 Hz over premotor, primary motor, and sensory areas of cortex at an intensity of 80% of the active motor threshold for the motor hand area. The excitability of some corticocortical connections in M1 was probed by using paired-pulse testing of intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with a coil placed over the motor cortex hand area. rTMS over the premotor cortex, but not other areas, changed the time course of the ICI/ICF for up to 1 hr afterward without affecting motor thresholds or motor-evoked potential recruitment. The cortical silent period was also shortened. The implication is that rTMS at a site distant from the motor cortex can change the excitability of circuits intrinsic to the motor cortex.", "pages": "25-31"}, {"volume": "72", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation alleviates truncal ataxia in spinocerebellar degeneration.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11784843", "authors": ["Shiga, Y", "Tsuda, T", "Itoyama, Y", "Shimizu, H", "Miyazawa, KI", "Jin, K", "Yamazaki, T"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "It has been suggested that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in free selection (FS), the process by which subjects themselves decide what action to perform. Evidence for this proposal has been provided by imaging studies showing activation of the DLPFC when subjects randomly generate responses. However, these response selection tasks have a hidden working memory element and it has been widely reported that the DLPFC is activated when subjects perform tasks which involve working memory. The primary aim of this experiment was to establish if the DLPFC is genuinely involved in response selection. We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate whether temporary interference of the DLPFC could disrupt performance of a response selection task that had no working memory component. Subjects performed tasks in which they made bimanual sequences of eight nonrepeating finger movements. In the FS task, subjects chose their movements at random while a computer monitor displayed these moves. This visual feedback obviated the need for subjects to maintain their previous moves \"on-line.\" No selection was required for the two control tasks as responses were cued by the visual display. The attentional demands of the control tasks varied. In the high load (HL) version, subjects had to maintain their attention throughout the sequence, but this requirement was absent in the low load (LL) task. rTMS over the DLPFC slowed response times on the FS task and at the end of the sequence on the HL task, but had no effect on the LL task. rTMS over the medial frontal cortex (MFC) slowed response times on the FS task but had no effect on the HL task. This suggests that a response selection task without a working memory load will depend on the DLPFC and the MFC. The difference appears to be that the DLPFC is important when selecting between competing responses or when concentrating if there is a high attentional demand, but that the MFC is only important during the response selection task.", "pages": "25-31"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Functional connectivity of human premotor and motor cortex explored with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11784802", "authors": ["M\u00fcnchau, A", "Bloem, BR", "Irlbacher, K", "Trimble, MR", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Use-dependent plasticity, thought to contribute to functional recovery after brain injury, is elicited by motor training.

Healthy human volunteers underwent a training period of voluntary thumb movements under the effects of placebo or d-amphetamine in different sessions in a randomized double-blind, counterbalanced design. Previous work in a drug-naive condition showed that such training causes changes in the direction of thumb movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation and in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electromyographic responses. The endpoint measure of the study was the magnitude of training-induced changes in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked kinematic and electromyographic responses in the d-amphetamine and in the placebo conditions. Motor training resulted in increased magnitude, faster development and longer lasting duration of use-dependent plasticity under d-amphetamine compared to the placebo session.

Forty-six normal volunteers were randomly assigned to receive one session of right (N = 16) or left prefrontal (N = 15), or sham (N = 15) rTMS at 1 HZ. Patients were assessed before and after stimulation by a computerized neurospychological battery. All three groups showed significant improvement over time in processing speed (reaction time) and efficiency (correct responses per unit of time). However, no time by group interaction was found for any of the neuropsychological tests.
