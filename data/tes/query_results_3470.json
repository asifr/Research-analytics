Suppression of voluntary muscle activity of hand and arm muscles in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex has been investigated in man. 2. Suppression could be elicited by low levels of TMS without any prior excitatory response. The latency of the suppression was 3-8 ms longer than the excitation observed at a higher stimulus intensity. The duration of the suppression ranged from 8 to 26 ms. 3. A circular stimulating coil was used to determine threshold intensity for excitation and suppression of contraction of thenar muscles in response to TMS at different locations over the motor cortex. The locations for lowest threshold excitation coincided with those for lowest threshold suppression. Suppression was elicited at a lower threshold than excitation at all locations. 4. A figure-of-eight stimulating coil was positioned over the left motor cortex at the lowest threshold point for excitation of the right thenar muscles. The orientation for the lowest threshold excitatory and inhibitory responses was the same for all subjects. That orientation induced a stimulating current travelling in an antero-medial direction. Suppression was invariably elicited at lower thresholds than excitation. 5. When antagonistic muscles (second and third dorsal interosseus) were co-contracted, TMS evoked coincident suppression of voluntary EMG in the two muscles without prior excitation of either muscle. This suggests that the suppression is not mediated via corticospinal activation of spinal interneurones. 6. Test responses to electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord were evoked in both relaxed and activated thenar muscles. In the relaxed muscle, prior TMS at an intensity that would suppress voluntary activity failed to influence the test responses, suggesting absence of inhibition at a spinal level. However, in the activated muscle, prior TMS could reduce the test response. This may be explained by disfacilitation of motoneurones due to inhibition of corticospinal output. 7. We propose that suppression of voluntary muscle activity by TMS is due in large part to activation of a mechanism within the motor cortex that reduces the corticospinal output to the muscle. It is concluded that TMS evokes excitation and inhibition via neuronal structures lying close to one another and having similar orientations.", "pages": "223-35"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "[The excitation site of MEP on facial nerve by transcranial magnetic stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "14232399", "authors": ["Gao, Z", "Zhang, L"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Optimal scalp location and current direction were determined for induction of MEPs in abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), and adductor digiti minimi (ADM); SOM in digits 2 and 5 in an ischemically paralyzed hand; and ADSS applied to digits 2 and 5. All 3 muscles' MEPs and SOM and ADSS in both digits were optimally activated from a single scalp position. In all subjects, optimal current directions for MEPs pointed anteriorly; those for ADSS and SOM pointed posteriorly. Optimal current directions showed the same progression in all subjects for MEPs (ADM, FDI, and APB from antero-lateral to antero-medial), ADSS (digit 5 postero-medial, 2 postero-lateral), and SOM (digit 1 through 5 postero-lateral to postero-medial).

Surface electromyographic activities were recorded from the left tibialis anterior muscle, and the latencies and amplitudes compared with those obtained by anodal electrical stimulation. The most stable responses were obtained when the large figure-eight coil was centered over the vertex and backward current was run through it or when the round coil was centered two to three centimeters anterior to the vertex with left-flowing current in it at the posterior widening.

One of the CJD patients had a normal size SEP, and neither patient showed hyperexcitability in SEP-recovery at C-T intervals of 20-60 msec at which there was marked MEP potentiation.

At rest, stimuli of similar intensity, related to the individual's threshold, elicited MEPs with amplitudes consistently larger in patients than in normal subjects, although when we compared the averaged MEP amplitude across all stimulus intensities, the differences reached only borderline statistical significance. Voluntary muscle activation elicited a smaller increase in the MEP area in PD patients than in normal subjects. Increasing the degree of voluntary muscle activation at fixed stimulus intensities elicited a smaller increase of MEP amplitude, duration, and area in PD patients than in normal subjects.

Methodologic problems were encountered in defining the SP and thus the duration of both an absolute (complete EMG silence) and relative (return of uninterrupted EMG activity) SP was measured. In all subjects, shortening of the SP duration occurred in relation to an increase in force when the criterion for absolute SP was used. Conversely, the relative SP duration suggested a trend toward prolongation with increasing force of contraction. No cumulative effects of TMS were observed on the absolute SP duration, whereas two subjects showed a cumulative effect of TMS on the relative SP.

Two coil positions were used: the coil held on a parasagittal line either with the induced current in the brain flowing in a postero-anterior direction (PA) or with the current flowing latero-medially (LM). The results were compared with those observed after anodal electrical stimulation. LM stimulation produced surface and single unit responses which occurred 0-3 msec earlier than PA stimulation. In many cases responses to LM stimulation had the same latency as those produced by anodal electrical stimulation. Responses evoked by LM stimulation were less affected by changes in motor cortical excitability (cortico-cortical inhibition and transcallosal inhibition) than those to PA stimulation. We suggest that LM stimulation can sometimes stimulate corticospinal fibres directly, at or near the same site as anodal stimulation. In contrast, PA stimulation tends to activate corticospinal fibres trans-synaptically. The difference in stimulation sites may make a comparison of PA and LM stimulation a useful method of localising changes in corticospinal excitability to a cortical level.", "pages": "223-35"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Magnetic transcranial and electrical stylomastoidal stimulation of the facial motor pathways in Bell's palsy: time course and relevance of electrophysiological parameters.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1373368", "authors": ["Glocker, FX", "Magistris, MR", "R\u00f6sler, KM", "Hess, CW"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Facial nerve motor neurography was performed at various times after the onset of Bell's palsy in 97 patients.

Additionally, the face-associated motor cortex was stimulated magnetically in 47 patients (CxStim). A marked reduction of the amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) evoked by MagStim on either m. nasalis or mentalis, or both, was observed which was clearly more pronounced than the amplitude reduction to ElStim. This discrepancy occurred very early during the disease, the mean amplitude (expressed in percent of the amplitude on the unaffected side) being 82% (S.D. 9.1) for ElStim and 1% (2.7) for MagStim at days 0-4. It persisted for several months, often when facial nerve function had recovered to normal, as assessed by clinical observation, ElStim, and CxStim. This amplitude decrease to MagStim, which appears to be related to a locally enhanced stimulation threshold of the facial nerve, is a very sensitive and reproducible finding in Bell's palsy. It may prove specific of the disorder, of diagnostic value, and of interest in the follow-up of patients during treatment trials.", "pages": "223-35"}]
