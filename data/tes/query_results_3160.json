The former is achieved by coregistering the head of the subject with an MR image of his/her brain using frameless stereotaxy. The latter is accomplished by identifying the coil on a transmission scan and coregistering it, e.g., with a model of the electrical field induced in the brain.", "pages": "399-402"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Study of central and peripheral conductions to the diaphragm in 22 patients with definite multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "9783118", "authors": ["Lagueny, A", "Arnaud, A", "Le Masson, G", "Burbaud, P", "Deliac, P", "Marthan, R"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Involvement of the diaphragm was evaluated electrophysiologically in 22 patients with definite multiple sclerosis. Magnetic transcranial stimulation (MTS), magnetic cervical stimulation at C4 level (MCS) and electric stimulation of the phrenic nerve at the neck (EPS) were performed for measuring latencies, motor conduction times and amplitudes of the responses recorded with a pair of surface or subcutaneous electrodes located at the xiphoid and the 8th costal interspace on the anterior axillary line. Latency of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) was abnormal: in 9 patients following MTS, in 6 following MCS, in 2 following EPS. The motor conduction time between the cortex and the cervical spine, we called CMCT1, was abnormal in 11 patients and the motor conduction time between the cortex and the neck, we called CMCT2, was abnormal in 8 patients. However CMCT1 was more often unmeasurable than CMCT2 because the MEPs following MCS were unreliable in 4 patients. The conduction time between the cervical spine and the neck was abnormally long in 2 patients but it was paradoxically abnormally short in 3, probably because of the difficulties in locating exactly the place of the stimulation at the cervical C4 level. The MEP amplitude was not considered a reliable parameter because of the large range of the values in our controls, although the mean amplitude was significantly lower in the patients than in the controls. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) following EPS was below the lower limit of the normal in 9 patients. The percentage of abnormal MEP latencies and CMCTs when both sides were combined was higher for the hemidiaphragms than for the upper limbs and was roughly the same for the hemidiaphragms and the lower limbs. Moreover electrophysiological study of the diaphragm was abnormal in 5 patients without pulmonary symptoms and with normal pulmonary function tests, demonstrating that this study is useful for revealing infraclinical demyelinating lesions on the central motor pathways down to diaphragm. In addition, alterations of the CMAPs in some patients suggest a possible extension of the lesions towards the anterior horns and anterior roots.", "pages": "399-402"}, {"volume": "95", "title": "Reversal of the bicycle drawing direction in Parkinson's disease by AC pulsed electromagnetic fields.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "9777443", "authors": ["Sandyk, R"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The International journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The Draw-a-Bicycle Test is employed in neuropsychological testing of cognitive skills since the bicycle design is widely known and also because of its complex structure. The Draw-a-Bicycle Test has been administered routinely to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders to evaluate the effect of transcranial applications of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla flux density on visuoconstructional skills. A seminal observation is reported in 5 medicated PD patients who demonstrated reversal of spontaneous drawing direction of the bicycle after they received a series of transcranial treatments with AC pulsed EMFs. In 3 patients reversal of the bicycle drawing direction was observed shortly after the administration of pulsed EMFs while in 2 patients these changes were observed within a time lag ranging from several weeks to months. All patients also demonstrated a dramatic clinical response to the administration of EMFs. These findings are intriguing because changes in drawing direction do not occur spontaneously in normal individuals as a result of relateralization of cognitive functions. This report suggests that administration of AC pulsed EMFs may induce in some PD patients changes in hemispheric dominance during processing of a visuoconstructional task and that these changes may be predictive of a particularly favourable response to AC pulsed EMFs therapy.", "pages": "399-402"}, {"volume": "102", "title": "Leprosy affects facial nerves at the main trunk: neurolysis can possibly avoid transfer procedures.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "9774012", "authors": ["Turkof, E", "Tambwekar, S", "Kamal, S", "El-Dahrawi, M", "Mansukhani, K", "Soliman, H", "Ciovica, R", "Mayr, N"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "abstract": "The predilective sites of lesions in leprous peripheral nerves are well established, and their surgical decompression is common practice when sensorimotor disorders persist after medication. By contrast, the precise localization of leprous facial neuropathy still remains unclear, and musculofascial transfers have been the only type of surgical treatment. The goal of this study was to clarify where leprosy affects facial nerves and to determine whether neurolysis might suffice to restore facial function. In five Indian and two Egyptian patients suffering from leprous facial neuritis, the nerves were stimulated transcranially at the brainstem to evoke efferent motor nerve action potentials, which were recorded from the exposed nerves. Lesions were detected at the main trunk proximally from the first bifurcation in all cases. Epineuriotomy revealed fibrosis of the interfascicular epineurium in all instances, as an indication for interfascicular neurolysis. One patient was able to close his eye and showed a better smile soon after surgery. After 16 and 21 months, respectively, one patient had improved distinctly, two patients slightly, two patients showing no progress, and two patients were lost to follow-up. It is concluded that (1) leprous facial neuropathy is located at the main trunk close to the first bifurcation and not exclusively at the peripheral zygomatic branches, (2) microsurgical neurolysis can be considered in leprous facial neuropathy before transfer procedures as long as voluntary or spontaneous activity is present in the affected muscles, and (3) intraoperative transcranial electrical stimulation is an effective means of localizing the site and proximal extent of leprous facial neuropathy.", "pages": "399-402"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Magnetic stimulation of the brain in animal depression models responsive to ECS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9773358", "authors": ["Belmaker, RH", "Grisaru, N"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "Studies in humans show antidepressant potential for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We therefore studied TMS in animal models of depression and compared its effects with those of ECS. ECS in rats has several robust behavioral effects, including enhancement of apomorphine-induced stereotypy, reduction of immobility time in the Porsolt swim test, and increases in seizure threshold for subsequent stimulation. Seven or 10 days of daily TMS consistently enhanced apomorphine-induced stereotypy, whereas a single session of TMS did not. Two TMS treatments markedly reduced immobility in the Porsolt swim test, as does ECS. A single TMS treatment markedly reduces the percentage of rats seizing in response to a ECS-like electrical stimulus to the brain 10 s later, as does an ECS treatment itself but not a sub-convulsive electrical stimulus to the brain. Long-term administration of ECS as well as other antidepressant treatments downregulates beta-adrenergic receptors. We found that TMS significantly reduced the density of [3H]CGP-12177 (a radioligand with beta-adrenergic affinity) binding sites in cortical (p < 0.05) but not hippocampal membranes. The role of monoamines in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments was investigated in numerous studies. Region-specific changes in the brain steady-state levels, and turnover rates of monoamines were detected 10 s after administration of a single repetitive TMS (rTMS) session. In the striatum and hippocampus, dopamine levels were increased by 25 +/- 1.5% and 18 +/- 0.8%, respectively, but were reduced in frontal cortex and decreased in the striatum and hippocampus in the TMS-treated rats with no change to the midbrain. TMS caused an increase in serotonin and 5-HIAA levels in the hippocampus but not in other brain regions examined in this study. The ability of TMS to induce behavioral and biochemical alterations similar to those of ECS may further support the potential role of TMS as an antidepressant treatment and bring us closer to the understanding of the mechanism of action of TMS.", "pages": "399-402"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Central motor conduction time: reproducibility and discomfort of different methods.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "9771668", "authors": ["Samii, A", "Luciano, CA", "Dambrosia, JM", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Central motor conduction time, a useful measure for studying central motor pathways, is calculated by determining the difference between the latency of motor-evoked potentials and peripheral conduction time.

Central motor conduction time was calculated by using measurements, made on 3 separate days, from the same three muscles on each hand. A visual analog pain scale was used to determine the level of discomfort for each method. Intraindividual trial-to-trial variability of central motor conduction time was similar for all methods, with coefficients of variation of 13% for the F-wave latency, 15% for cervical magnetic stimulation, and 11% for cervical needle stimulation. The last method was significantly more painful than the other two methods; there was no significant difference in discomfort between the F-wave method and cervical magnetic stimulation.

In this paper, we studied long-term neurophysiological effects of rTMS delivered to the motor cortex at 5 Hz with an intensity of 120% of motor threshold. Each stimulus of the train produced muscle-evoked potentials (MEPs) in hand and forearm muscles, which gradually increased in size from the first to the last shock. After the end of the train, the response to a single-test stimulus remained enhanced for 600-900 ms. In contrast, the train had no effect on the size of the MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation, while it suppressed H-reflexes in forearm muscles for 900 ms. We conclude that rTMS of these parameters increases the excitability of the motor cortex and that this effect outlasts the train for almost 1 s.

Eighteen subjects played unimanual finger sequences of different complexity on an electronic piano. For each finger sequence, 16 notes were played to the 2 Hz beat of a metronome. After the first four notes, rTMS was applied to the scalp location overlying the hand motor representation for approximately 2 s. Accuracy and timing errors were analysed. Stimulation over the M1 had a differential effect on sequences of different complexity. Stimulus intensities capable of disrupting the performance of a complex sequence did not affect simple sequences. To disrupt simple sequences, the stimulus strength had to be augmented. This effect was characteristic of the contralateral M1 position (five other scalp locations were also stimulated). It is argued that the differential effect of rTMS on simple and complex sequences is probably due to interference with M1 function. Interference with the lateral premotor cortex (PMC) may play an additional role. The particular relevance of the M1 is supported by results in a patient with PMC stroke. The present findings suggest that the human M1 plays a greater role in the performance of complex than of simple finger movement sequences. One possible explanation could be that the human M1 is not only an executive motor area but can also contribute to movement sequence organization.", "pages": "399-402"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Effects of transcranial micropolarization of the frontal cortex on the state of motor and cognitive functions in extrapyramidal pathology.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "9762725", "authors": ["Shelyakin, AM", "Preobrazhenskaya, IG", "Pisar'kova, EV", "Pakhomova, ZhM", "Bogdanov, OV"], "year": "", "journal": "Neuroscience and behavioral physiology", "abstract": "The examination of 250 children with neurosensory hypoacusis (NSH) demonstrated a 78% efficacy of endaural phonophoresis with dalargin (DPP) and transcranial electrostimulation (TCE) for improvement of acoustic function in the presence of positive ultrasound prognosis.
