Changes in motor cortical excitability under behavioural conditions presumably connected with premotor and supplementary motor area (SMA) activation were investigated by comparing the size of the MEPs obtained during: (1) rest, (2) mental calculus, (3) repetitive left thumb-to-index opposition, (4) mental simulation of the same task with the right hand, (5) sequences of left thumb-to-fingers opposition, and (6) mental simulation of the same sequences with the right hand. MEP size significantly increased in both muscles during sequential movements of the left hand and sequence simulation with the right hand, but not during mental calculus or actual or simulated repetitive movements. The H-reflex evoked in the OP and FDS muscles by electrical stimulation of the median nerve (at wrist and elbow, respectively) under the same experimental conditions did not show significant modifications. The increase in MEP size during non-routine actual or imagined sequences of finger movements supports the view that the SMA is activated under these conditions and that it exerts a direct facilitatory influence on the motor cortex.", "pages": "465-72"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Insights into motor performance and muscle fatigue based on transcranial stimulation of the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10-11", "pmid": "8911740", "authors": ["Gandevia, SC"], "year": "", "journal": "Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology", "abstract": "1. Direct cortical stimulation of motor and sensory areas of the cortex in experimental animals and some neurosurgical patients has provided much useful physiological information. Some of the benefits of this approach can be provided in awake volunteer subjects using new techniques which activate the motor cortex thorough the skull (i.e. transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation). 2. Both electrical and magnetic transcranial stimulation produce complex descending corticospinal volleys which usually contain a direct component (via corticofugal axons) and an indirect trans-synaptic component. Changes in cortical 'excitability' can affect the evoked corticofugal volleys and the electromyographic responses which they involve. 3. Apart from its diagnostic applications to patients with neurological disorders, transcranial stimulation has been applied to the study of a range of aspects of human motor control ranging from apparent cortical 'plasticity' to the changes in cortical behaviour produced by exercise.", "pages": "465-72"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Differences in sensitivity between magnetic motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials in experimental spinal cord lesions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "19", "pmid": "8902962", "authors": ["Hiraizumi, Y", "Transfeldt, EE", "Kawahara, N", "Yamada, H"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Graded posterior spinal cord compression and partial sectioning of the spinal cord were performed, and magnetically induced descending spinal cord potentials were recorded.", "pages": "465-72"}, {"volume": "142", "title": "Silent period evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in unilateral thalamic infarcts.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "8902725", "authors": ["Faig, J", "Busse, O"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "To compare the sensitivity of transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials in the spinal cord and other spinal cord evoked potentials to spinal cord lesions.", "pages": "465-72"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "Speech-induced changes in corticospinal excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "8871583", "authors": ["Tokimura, H", "Tokimura, Y", "Oliviero, A", "Asakura, T", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Somatosensory-evoked potentials have been the standard technique for monitoring spinal cord function during spinal surgery.

Single transcranial magnetic stimuli were given randomly over the hand area of either the left or right motor cortex of 10 right-handed and 3 left-handed normal volunteers. Electromyographic responses were recorded in the relaxed first dorsal interosseous muscle while the subjects (a) read aloud a piece of text, (b) read silently, (c) spoke spontaneously, or (d) made sounds without speaking. The only consistent effect across subjects occurred during task a, which significantly increased the size of responses evoked in the dominant hand of all subjects, but had either no effect (8 subjects) or a smaller effect in the nondominant hand. Tasks b and d had no reliable effect, whereas task c tended to increase response size in both hands. Control measurements suggest that the effects in task a were caused by changes in cortical rather than spinal excitability. This is the first demonstration of lateralized speech effects on the excitability of cortical arm areas. The results provide a useful adjunct to other tests of cerebral dominance, using only single- rather than repetitive-pulse cortical stimulation.", "pages": "465-72"}]
