It may arise not only because of peripheral changes at the level of the muscle, but also because the central nervous system fails to drive the motoneurons adequately. Evidence for \"central\" fatigue and the neural mechanisms underlying it are reviewed, together with its terminology and the methods used to reveal it. Much data suggest that voluntary activation of human motoneurons and muscle fibers is suboptimal and thus maximal voluntary force is commonly less than true maximal force. Hence, maximal voluntary strength can often be below true maximal muscle force. The technique of twitch interpolation has helped to reveal the changes in drive to motoneurons during fatigue. Voluntary activation usually diminishes during maximal voluntary isometric tasks, that is central fatigue develops, and motor unit firing rates decline. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex during fatiguing exercise has revealed focal changes in cortical excitability and inhibitability based on electromyographic (EMG) recordings, and a decline in supraspinal \"drive\" based on force recordings. Some of the changes in motor cortical behavior can be dissociated from the development of this \"supraspinal\" fatigue. Central changes also occur at a spinal level due to the altered input from muscle spindle, tendon organ, and group III and IV muscle afferents innervating the fatiguing muscle. Some intrinsic adaptive properties of the motoneurons help to minimize fatigue. A number of other central changes occur during fatigue and affect, for example, proprioception, tremor, and postural control. Human muscle fatigue does not simply reside in the muscle.", "pages": "1725-89"}, {"volume": "536", "title": "Unexpected reflex response to transmastoid stimulation in human subjects during near-maximal effort.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "11579178", "authors": ["Taylor, JL", "Butler, JE", "Petersen, NT", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "2001", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. In human subjects, a high-voltage electrical pulse between electrodes fixed over the mastoid processes activates descending tract axons at the level of the cervico-medullary junction to produce motor responses (cevicomedullary evoked responses; CMEPs) in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles. 2. During isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the elbow flexors, CMEPs in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles are sometimes followed by a second compound muscle action potential. This response can be observed in single trials (amplitude of up to 60 % of the maximal M wave) and follows the CMEP by about 16 ms in both muscles. The response only occurs during very strong voluntary contractions. 3. The second response following transmastoid stimulation appears with stimulation intensities that are at the threshold for evoking a CMEP in the contracting muscles. The response grows with increasing stimulus intensity, but then decreases in amplitude and finally disappears at high stimulation intensities. 4. A single stimulus to the brachial plexus during MVCs can also elicit a second response (following the M wave) in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles. The latency of this response is 3-4 ms longer than that of the second response observed following transmastoid stimulation. This difference in latency is consistent with a reflex response to stimulation of large-diameter afferents. 5. The amplitude of the second response to transmastoid stimulation can be reduced by appropriately timed subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimuli. This result is consistent with intracortical inhibition of the response. 6. We suggest that transmastoid stimulation can elicit a large transcortical reflex response in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles. The response travels via the motor cortex but is only apparent during near-maximal voluntary efforts.", "pages": "1725-89"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic tool in psychiatry: what do we know about the neurobiological mechanisms?", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "7944293", "authors": ["Post, A", "Keck, ME"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of psychiatric research", "abstract": "Potential therapeutic properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been suggested in several psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. By inducing electric currents in brain tissue via a time-varying strong magnetic field, rTMS has the potential to either directly or trans-synaptically modulate neuronal circuits thought to be dysfunctional in these psychiatric disorders. However, in order to optimize rTMS for therapeutic use, it is necessary to understand the neurobiological mechanisms involved, particularly the nature of the changes induced and the brain regions affected. Compared to the growing number of clinical studies on its putative therapeutic properties, the studies on the basic mechanisms of rTMS are surprisingly scarce. rTMS currently still awaits clinical routine administration although,there is compelling evidence that it causes changes in neuronal circuits as reflected by behavioural changes and decreases in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system. Both alterations suggest regional changes in neurotransmitter/neuromodulator release, transsynaptic efficiency, signaling pathways and in gene transcription. Together, these changes are, in part, reminiscent of those accompanying antidepressant drugs.", "pages": "1725-89"}, {"volume": "190", "title": "Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transcranial magnetic stimulation for the detection of upper motor neuron degeneration in ALS patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "8120818", "authors": ["Pohl, C", "Block, W", "Tr\u00e4ber, F", "Schmidt, S", "Pels, H", "Grothe, C", "Schild, HH", "Klockgether, T"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was compared to proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for the detection of upper motor neuron loss or dysfunction in 49 ALS patients classified according to the El Escorial criteria.

We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to suppress the excitability of a portion of left prefrontal cortex and to assess its role in producing nouns and verbs. In one experiment subjects generated real words; in a second, they produced pseudowords as nouns or verbs. In both experiments, response latencies increased for verbs but were unaffected for nouns following rTMS.
