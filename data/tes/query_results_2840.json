Lesion topography documented by MRI studies was correlated with the electrophysiological findings. In the majority of patients the corticofacial fibres travel within the ventromedial base of the pons and cross the midline at the level of the facial nucleus. In some individuals, however, we found evidence that corticolingual fibres form an 'aberrant bundle' in a paralemniscal position at the dorsal edge of the pontine base. In other patients the corticofacial fibres loop down into the ventral part of the upper medulla, cross the midline and ascend in the dorsolateral medullary region ipsilaterally to the facial nucleus. The findings suggest that facial paresis due to a brainstem lesion may present as contralateral supranuclear facial paresis by a lesion of the cerebral peduncle, pontine base, the aberrant bundle and the ventral medulla. Supranuclear facial paresis ipsilateral to the lesion side may result from a lesion in the lateral medulla, and facial paresis of the supranuclear type may be imitated by a lesion of the peripheral facial nerve in the dorsolateral medulla with involvement of the lower pons.", "pages": "58-9"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "The course of corticofacial projections in the human brainstem.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 9", "pmid": "11522588", "authors": ["Urban, PP", "Wicht, S", "Vucorevic, G", "Fitzek, S", "Marx, J", "Th\u00f6mke, F", "Mika-Gr\u00fcttner, A", "Fitzek, C", "Stoeter, P", "Hopf, HC"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "To test whether the most rapid visually evoked reach adjustments are cortically organized in humans, we have measured their latency in a healthy subject with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. This condition precludes direct communication between left and right cerebral cortices and so, in this subject, a purely cortical visuomotor process would be expected to produce longer-latency responses to a target that appears in the visual hemifield contralateral to the responding limb (crossed) compared with the ipsilateral hemifield (uncrossed). As predicted, when performing simple reaction time tasks that involved lifting a finger or an arm in response to a visual stimulus presented to either hemifield, this acallosal subject showed a significant crossed-uncrossed latency difference (mean 35.8 ms) that was not present in control subjects (group mean 2.2 ms). In contrast, when she reached for a target that unexpectedly jumped into either visual hemifield, the latencies of mid-flight adjustment were the same (approximately 120 ms) irrespective of either the target jump direction or which hand was used. This was not due to an early movement of the eyes bringing the target back on to the fovea since this subject's finger always deviated towards the new target position in advance of her eyes. Neither could it be explained by the use of ipsilateral corticospinal projections since transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex failed to evoke ipsilateral responses in arm or hand muscles. These results suggest that, even in humans, subcortical structures are involved in the fastest adjustments of the reaching arm made in response to fresh visual information. An additional finding in this subject was that, when reaching, the eye saccadic latency was greater by 36 ms on average when the target jumped right compared with left, irrespective of which hand was being used. This is the same value as the mean interhemispheric transfer time obtained in the simple reaction time tasks and may indicate right-hemispheric dominance for saccadic eye movement control.", "pages": "58-9"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Evidence for subcortical involvement in the visual control of human reaching.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 9", "pmid": "11522585", "authors": ["Day, BL", "Brown, P"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "A procedure is outlined in which the excitability of the corticomotor pathway is examined during rhythmic, passive upper limb movement. Using a custom built apparatus and software, wrist flexion-extension movements of a programmable frequency, amplitude and duration are induced while transcranial magnetic stimuli are delivered to the contralateral cortex over the area representing the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Stimuli are timed to occur during different phases of the movement cycle in order to examine the influence of ascending sensory input on the excitability of the corticospinal pathway. The protocol enables modulations in evoked responses to be analysed during movement of different frequencies and amplitudes, and permits alterations in cortical excitability to be examined by using paired pulse paradigms. The technique may also be utilised to examine hemispheric and segmental transfer if a stationary target limb is probed while the contralateral limb is passively moved. The protocol has potential use in examining corticomotor excitability in subjects with deficits in sensory and/or motor function, such as patients with Parkinson's disease or individuals recovering from stroke.", "pages": "58-9"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "A method to monitor corticomotor excitability during passive rhythmic movement of the upper limb.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11522531", "authors": ["Lewis, GN", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Brain research.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess excitability of the motor system reflected in the parameters motor threshold, recruitment curve, intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation before and after oral administration of 20 and 40 mg yohimbine. Oral intake of 40 but not 20 mg yohimbine increased slope and plateau of the recruitment curve and intracortical facilitation. Motor threshold and intracortical inhibition remained unchanged. The data show that pharmacological enhancement of central norepinephrine in humans is effective to increase the cortico-motoneuronal excitability.
