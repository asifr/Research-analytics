The SE is defined as the condition in which a seizure persists for a sufficient length of time or is repeated frequently enough that recovery between attacks does not occur. Until recently, the most popular duration of seizures qualifying as SE has been 30 min. Nonetheless some clinicians suggest that the duration of the seizures that qualifies the SE should be shorter. In clinical settings the diagnosis of SE could be difficult without EEGs in patients who have complex partial SE or subtle SE, as their manifestation is coma without apparent motor sings. Pseudo-SE (psychogenic seizures) should be included in the differential diagnosis. Antiepileptic treatment should be administered immediately according to the protocol once the diagnosis of SE is made. In patients with refractory SE, general anesthesia with propofol or midazolam is recommended. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the brain is effective for the treatment of SE in experimental animals, however further studies are necessary for clinical use.", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Single pulse stimulation of the human subthalamic nucleus facilitates the motor cortex at short intervals.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15152016", "authors": ["Hanajima, R", "Ashby, P", "Lozano, AM", "Lang, AE", "Chen, R"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). The mechanism is poorly understood. High-frequency STN DBS has been reported to affect motor cortex excitability in a complex way, but the timing between STN stimuli and changes in motor cortical (M1) excitability has not been investigated. We examined the time course of changes in motor cortical excitability following single pulse STN DBS. We studied 14 PD patients with implanted DBS electrodes in the STN, 2 patients with electrodes in internal globus pallidus (GPi), and 1 patient with an electrode in the sensory thalamus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the M1 ipsilateral to the DBS with induced currents either in the anterior-posterior direction in the brain to evoke indirect (I) waves or in the lateral-medial direction to activate corticospinal axons directly. Single pulse stimulation through the DBS contacts preceded the TMS by 0-10 ms. Surface EMG was recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. Three milliseconds after STN stimulation, the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes produced by anterior-posterior current were significantly larger than control responses, while the responses to lateral-medial currents were unchanged. Similar facilitation also occurred after GPi stimulation, but not with thalamic stimulation. Single pulse STN stimulation facilitates the M1 at short latencies. The possible mechanisms include antidromic excitation of the cortico-STN fibers or transmission through the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway.", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Facilitation of visuo-motor learning by transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor and extrastriate visual areas in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "15147322", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Kincses, TZ", "Kruse, W", "Hoffmann, KP", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Performance of visuo-motor tasks requires the transfer of visual data to motor performance and depends highly on visual perception and cognitive processing, mainly during the learning phase. The primary aim of this study was to determine if the human middle temporal (MT)+/V5, an extrastriate visual area that is known to mediate motion processing, and the primary motor cortex are involved in learning of visuo-motor coordination tasks. To pursue this, we increased or decreased MT+/V5, primary contralateral motor (M1) and primary visual cortex excitability by 10 min of anodal or cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy human subjects during the learning phase of a visually guided tracking task. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased significantly in the early learning phase during anodal stimulation, but only when the left V5 or M1 was stimulated. Cathodal stimulation had no significant effect. Also, stimulation of the primary visual cortex was not effective for this kind of task. Our data suggest that the areas V5 and M1 are involved in the early phase of learning of visuo-motor coordination.", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "GABAergic modulation of DC stimulation-induced motor cortex excitability shifts in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "15147306", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Liebetanz, D", "Schlitterlau, A", "Henschke, U", "Fricke, K", "Frommann, K", "Lang, N", "Henning, S", "Paulus, W", "Tergau, F"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Weak transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex results in excitability shifts during and after the end of stimulation, which are most probably localized intracortically. Anodal stimulation enhances excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation reduces it. Although the after-effects of tDCS are NMDA receptor-dependent, nothing is known about the involvement of additional receptors. Here we show that pharmacological strengthening of GABAergic inhibition modulates selectively the after-effects elicited by anodal tDCS. Administration of the GABA(A) receptor agonist lorazepam resulted in a delayed, but then enhanced and prolonged anodal tDCS-induced excitability elevation. The initial absence of an excitability enhancement under lorazepam is most probably caused by a loss of the anodal tDCS-generated intracortical diminution of inhibition and enhancement of facilitation, which occurs without pharmacological intervention. The reasons for the late-occurring excitability enhancement remain unclear. Because intracortical inhibition and facilitation are not changed in this phase compared with pre-tDCS values, excitability changes originating from remote cortical or subcortical areas could be involved.", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "187", "title": "Immediate plasticity in the motor pathways after spinal cord hemisection: implications for transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15144873", "authors": ["Fujiki, M", "Kobayashi, H", "Inoue, R", "Ishii, K"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "The present study evaluates motor functional recovery after C2 spinal cord hemisection with or without contralateral brachial root transection, which causes a condition that is similar to the crossed phrenic phenomenon on rats. Descending motor pathways, including the reticulospinal extrapyramidal tract and corticospinal pyramidal tracts, were evaluated by transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (mMEPs) and direct cortical electrical motor-evoked potentials (eMEP), respectively. All MEPs recorded from the left forelimb were abolished immediately after the left C2 hemisection. Left mMEPs recovered dramatically immediately after contralateral right brachial root transection. Corticospinal eMEPs never recovered, regardless of transection. The facilitation of mMEPs in animals that had undergone combined contralateral root transection was well correlated with open-field behavioral motor performance. Both electrophysiological and neurological facilitations were significantly attenuated by the selective serotonin synthesis inhibitor para-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA). These results suggest that serotonergic reticulospinal fibers located contralateral to hemisection contribute to the behavioral and electrophysiological improvement that immediately follows spinal cord injury (SCI).", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Activation of the external anal and urethral sphincter muscles by repetitive transcranial cortical stimulation during spine surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15139577", "authors": ["Haghighi, SS", "Zhang, R"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "abstract": "Clinical utility of high intensity repetitive transcranial electrical stimulation (rTES) to elicit a response in external anal and urethral sphincter muscles was investigated in 23 patients undergoing spine surgery.", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Concept formation: 'object' attributes dynamically inhibited from conscious awareness.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15139077", "authors": ["Snyder, A", "Bossomaier, T", "Mitchell, DJ"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of integrative neuroscience", "abstract": "During surgery, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from external anal sphincter (EAS), external urethral sphincter (EUS), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles following high voltage rTES under total intravenous anesthesia.", "pages": "799-801"}, {"volume": "361", "title": "Corticospinal excitability during painful self-stimulation in humans: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "15135940", "authors": ["Fadiga, L", "Craighero, L", "Dri, G", "Facchin, P", "Destro, MF", "Porro, CA"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "No neurologic sequelae occurred during or after the rTES of the motor cortex.

Concepts are groupings of \"object\" attributes. Once the brain learns such critical groupings, the \"object\" attributes are inhibited from conscious awareness. We see the whole, not the parts. The details are inhibited when the concept network is activated, ie. the inhibition is dynamic and can be switched on and off. Autism is suggested to be the state of retarded concept formation. Our model predicts the possibility of accessing nonconscious information by artificially disinhibiting (turning off) the inhibiting networks associated with concept formation, using transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (TMS). For example, this opens the door for the restoration of perfect pitch, for recalling detail, for acquiring accent-free second languages beyond puberty, and even for enhancing creativity. The model further shows how unusual autistic savant skills as well as certain psychopathologies can be due respectively to privileged or inadvertent access to information that is normally inhibited from conscious awareness.", "pages": "799-801"}]
