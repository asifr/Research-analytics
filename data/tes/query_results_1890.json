Experimentelle Hirnforschung. Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to study sensorimotor integration in humans non-invasively. Motor excitability has been found to be inhibited when afferent stimuli are given to a peripheral nerve and precede TMS at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20-50 ms. This phenomenon has been referred to as short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). To better understand the functional meaning of these phenomena, we examined the effect of the size of the receptive field on SAI to cutaneous afferents in upper-limb sensorimotor areas in humans. We examined the effect of the stimulation of the isolated right first (D1), second (D2) and third finger (D3), the right second and third finger together (D23) and the right first three fingers together (D123) on the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS in hand and forearm muscles. We examined the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles. Digital stimulation preceded TMS at ISIs of 20-50 ms. The effect of D2 stimulation was MEP inhibition (SAI), which was more marked and consistent in APB and FDI muscles than in ECR and FCR muscles. Similarly, D1 and D3 stimulation caused MEP reduction, while no MEP enhancement could be found to single finger stimulation. In contrast, D123 stimulation induced less effective SAI in upper-limb muscles. MEP potentiation was recorded in some muscles to D123 stimulation. A significant difference between D2 and D123 stimulation was found in APB (ISIs = 30-50 ms) and FDI (ISIs = 40-50 ms) muscles, but not in forearm muscles. The effect to D23stimulation on MEP amplitude was intermediate between those to D2 and D123 stimulation. Our data suggest that motor excitability to cutaneous afferents may be influenced by the size of the receptive fields, this effect being the result of increasing convergence between hand afferents in the somatosensory system. These phenomena appear to be topographically arranged across the representation of upper-limb muscles. These findings may help to understand the functional significance of SAI in normal physiology and pathophysiology.", "pages": "362-9"}, {"volume": "168", "title": "Kinesthetic, but not visual, motor imagery modulates corticomotor excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "16078024", "authors": ["Stinear, CM", "Byblow, WD", "Steyvers, M", "Levin, O", "Swinnen, SP"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The aim of this study was to examine the modulation of corticomotor excitability during two types of strategies for motor imagery: Kinesthetic Motor Imagery (KMI) and Visual Motor Imagery (VMI) in a phasic thumb movement task. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the contralateral motor cortex (M1) to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the dominant abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM). In a separate experiment, transcutaneous electrical stimuli were delivered to the median nerve at the dominant wrist, to elicit F-waves from APB. Imagined task performance was paced with a 1 Hz auditory metronome, and stimuli were delivered either 50 ms before (ON phase), or 450 ms after (OFF phase), the metronome beeps. Recordings were also made during two control conditions: Rest, and a Visual Static Imagery (VSI) condition. Significant MEP amplitude facilitation occurred only in APB, and only during the ON phase of KMI. F-wave persistence and amplitude were unaffected by imagery. These results demonstrate that kinesthetic, but not visual, motor imagery modulates corticomotor excitability, primarily at the supraspinal level. These findings have implications for the definition of motor imagery, and for its therapeutic applications.", "pages": "362-9"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Reductions in neural activity underlie behavioral components of repetition priming.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "16056222", "authors": ["Wig, GS", "Grafton, ST", "Demos, KE", "Kelley, WM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "Repetition priming is a nonconscious form of memory that is accompanied by reductions in neural activity when an experience is repeated. To date, however, there is no direct evidence that these neural reductions underlie the behavioral advantage afforded to repeated material. Here we demonstrate a causal linkage between neural and behavioral priming in humans. fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) was used in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to target and disrupt activity in the left frontal cortex during repeated classification of objects. Left-frontal TMS disrupted both the neural and behavioral markers of priming. Neural priming in early sensory regions was unaffected by left-frontal TMS--a finding that provides evidence for separable conceptual and perceptual components of priming.", "pages": "362-9"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for epilepsy: can it also improve depression and vice versa?", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16127445", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Schachter, SC", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "Comorbidity with depression is an important determinant of the quality of life for patients with epilepsy. Antidepressant medications can effectively treat depression in epileptic patients, but drug-drug interactions and epileptogenic effects of these drugs pose therapeutic challenges. The mood-stabilizing effects of antiepileptic medications may not be sufficient to treat depression. Therefore, treatments that alleviate the burden of depression without increasing seizure risk or, better yet, with the possibility of improving seizure control are worth exploring. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, are providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of depression in epilepsy. For example, there appears to be prominent brain prefrontal hypoactivity, which may be sustained by the hyperactivity of the seizure focus. If so, neuromodulatory approaches that suppress epileptic focus hyperactivity and concurrently enhance prefrontal activity may be ideally suited. Indeed, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to yield simultaneous antiseizure and mood effects. Another neuromodulatory technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can also modulate brain activity, but in a noninvasive, painless, and focal manner. Depending on the stimulation parameters, it is possible to enhance or reduce activity in the targeted brain region. Furthermore, TMS has been shown to be effective in treating depression, and preliminary data suggest that this treatment may also be effective for epilepsy treatment. This article reviews these data and explores further the question of whether depression and epilepsy can be simultaneously treated with TMS for optimal therapeutic impact.", "pages": "362-9"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "The role of the human posterior parietal cortex in memory-guided saccade execution: a double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16054872", "authors": ["Nyffeler, T", "Egli, A", "Pflugshaupt, T", "von Wartburg, R", "Wurtz, P", "Mosimann, U", "Hess, CW", "M\u00fcri, RM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The present study investigated the role of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in the triggering of memory-guided saccades by means of double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS). Shortly before saccade onset, dTMS with different interstimulus intervals (ISI; 35, 50, 65 or 80 ms) was applied. For contralateral saccades, dTMS significantly decreased saccadic latency with an ISI of 80 ms and increased saccadic gain with an ISI of 65 and 80 ms. Together with the findings of a previous study during frontal eye field (FEF) stimulation the present results demonstrate similarities and differences between both regions in the execution of memory-guided saccades. Firstly, dTMS facilitates saccade triggering in both regions, but the timing is different. Secondly, dTMS over the PPC provokes a hypermetria of contralateral memory-guided saccades that was not observed during FEF stimulation. The results are discussed within the context of recent neurophysiological findings in monkeys.", "pages": "362-9"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "How does transcranial DC stimulation of the primary motor cortex alter regional neuronal activity in the human brain?", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16045507", "authors": ["Lang, N", "Siebner, HR", "Ward, NS", "Lee, L", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Rothwell, JC", "Lemon, RN", "Frackowiak, RS"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor hand area (M1) can produce lasting polarity-specific effects on corticospinal excitability and motor learning in humans. In 16 healthy volunteers, O positron emission tomography (PET) of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest and during finger movements was used to map lasting changes in regional synaptic activity following 10 min of tDCS (+/-1 mA). Bipolar tDCS was given through electrodes placed over the left M1 and right frontopolar cortex. Eight subjects received anodal or cathodal tDCS of the left M1, respectively. When compared to sham tDCS, anodal and cathodal tDCS induced widespread increases and decreases in rCBF in cortical and subcortical areas. These changes in rCBF were of the same magnitude as task-related rCBF changes during finger movements and remained stable throughout the 50-min period of PET scanning. Relative increases in rCBF after real tDCS compared to sham tDCS were found in the left M1, right frontal pole, right primary sensorimotor cortex and posterior brain regions irrespective of polarity. With the exception of some posterior and ventral areas, anodal tDCS increased rCBF in many cortical and subcortical regions compared to cathodal tDCS. Only the left dorsal premotor cortex demonstrated an increase in movement related activity after cathodal tDCS, however, modest compared with the relatively strong movement-independent effects of tDCS. Otherwise, movement related activity was unaffected by tDCS. Our results indicate that tDCS is an effective means of provoking sustained and widespread changes in regional neuronal activity. The extensive spatial and temporal effects of tDCS need to be taken into account when tDCS is used to modify brain function.", "pages": "362-9"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Sacral nerve stimulation reduces corticoanal excitability in patients with faecal incontinence.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "16045502", "authors": ["Sheldon, R", "Kiff, ES", "Clarke, A", "Harris, ML", "Hamdy, S"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The British journal of surgery", "abstract": "Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) can produce symptomatic relief in patients with faecal incontinence.
