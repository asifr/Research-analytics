TMS inducing posterior-anterior (PA) current in the brain predominantly recruits the early I1-wave, whereas anterior-posterior (AP) directed current preferentially recruits the late I3-wave. However, it is not known whether I-waves elicited by different current directions are mediated by the same neuronal populations. We studied the neuronal mechanisms mediating I-waves by examining the influence of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) on various I-waves. SAI was tested with electrical median nerve stimulation at the wrist followed by TMS to the contralateral M1 at different current directions. Surface electromyograms and single motor units were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. SAI was weaker for the AP compared with that for the PA current direction. With increasing median nerve stimulation intensities, SAI increased for the PA direction but showed a U-shaped relationship for the AP direction. SAI produced more inhibition of late I-waves generated by PA than those generated by AP current direction. We conclude that late I-waves generated by PA and AP current directions are mediated by different neuronal mechanisms.", "pages": "749-56"}, {"volume": "227", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation induces polarity-specific changes of cortical blood perfusion in the rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "21147105", "authors": ["Wachter, D", "Wrede, A", "Schulz-Schaeffer, W", "Taghizadeh-Waghefi, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Kutschenko, A", "Rohde, V", "Liebetanz, D"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces changes in cortical excitability and improves hand-motor function in chronic stroke.

However, its putative antidepressant, cognitive and behavior action is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the distribution of neuronal electrical activity changes after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and cathodal tDCS of the right supraorbital region using spectral power analysis and standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA). Ten healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS on separate days in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA intensity over the left DLPFC, while the cathode was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region. After tDCS, EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting state followed by a working memory (n-back) task. Statistical non-parametric mapping showed reduced left frontal delta activity in the real tDCS condition. Specifically, a significant reduction of mean current densities (sLORETA) for the delta band was detected in the left subgenual PFC, the anterior cingulate and in the left medial frontal gyrus. Moreover, the effect was strongest for the first 5 min (p<0.01). The following n-back task revealed a positive impact of prefrontal tDCS on error rate, accuracy and reaction time. This was accompanied by increased P2- and P3- event-related potentials (ERP) component-amplitudes for the 2-back condition at the electrode Fz. A source localization using sLORETA for the time window 250-450 ms showed enhanced activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus for the 2-back condition. These results suggest that anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and/or cathodal tDCS of the contralateral supraorbital region may modulate regional electrical activity in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to improving working memory performance.", "pages": "749-56"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "The effects of paired associative stimulation on knee extensor motor excitability of individuals post-stroke: a pilot study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "16221842", "authors": ["Rogers, LM", "Brown, DA", "Stinear, JW"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "surgical correction of symptomatic cervical or cervicothoracic kyphosis involves the potential for significant neurological complications.
