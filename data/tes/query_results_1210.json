The target inside the head is stimulated with eddy currents induced in the tissues by the time-varying magnetic field. TMS has been used in several applications in medical and clinical research which include brain mapping, treatment of mood disorder and schizophrenia, treatment of epilepsy, treatment of chronic pain and so on. The stimulation effect can be affected by the stimulation intensity. For coils with the same shape, different winding methods make the coil have different stimulation intensity. In this paper, three different methods for winding circular coils are discussed. The electromagnetic fields induced by the three different circular coils were analyzed. The results show that the circular coil with the pancake coil winding has the strongest stimulation intensity.", "pages": "4270-3"}, {"volume": "2008", "title": "Modeling transcranial DC stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19163645", "authors": ["Oostendorp, TF", "Hengeveld, YA", "Wolters, CH", "Stinstra, J", "van Elswijk, G", "Stegeman, DF"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The accuracy is only exceeded by direct electrical stimulation of the brain during surgery. Brain-mapping using robotic TMS can also be used to detect displacements of brain regions caused by tumors. The advantage of TMS is that it is non-invasive. In this study, we compare results from statistical mapping with robotic TMS to results achieved from direct stimulation done during tumor surgery. To our knowledge this is the first study of this type. We mapped the representation of three muscle groups (forearm, pinky and thumb) in tumor patients with the robot-aided TMS protocol and with direct stimulation.

Conference", "abstract": "The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is an effective tool for investigating the cortical reactivity and the functional connectivity in the brain. In our previous study, we reported a method of removing stimulus artifact during TMS with Sample-and-Hold circuit and EEG activity evoked by TMS could be measured successfully. In addition to this method, independent component analysis (ICA) was also applied to recorded EEG data in order to remove the stimulus artifact from for off-line analysis. By using these methods, short latency ( 15 ms) EEG responses to TMS could be obtained. In this paper, we focused on the propagation of EEG activity elicited by TMS. We observed both the EEG topography and the distribution of the current density over the whole head by changing the stimulus site. When motor cortex was stimulated, the propagation of EEG activity to contralateral hemisphere could be clearly observed. However, when posterior parietal cortex was stimulated, no or less propagation of EEG responses could be recognized. These results suggest that the responses evoked by TMS over motor cortex propagate to contralateral hemisphere along the axon through the corpus callosum.", "pages": "4270-3"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Action anticipation and motor resonance in elite basketball players.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "19160510", "authors": ["Aglioti, SM", "Cesari, P", "Romani, M", "Urgesi, C"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "We combined psychophysical and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies to investigate the dynamics of action anticipation and its underlying neural correlates in professional basketball players. Athletes predicted the success of free shots at a basket earlier and more accurately than did individuals with comparable visual experience (coaches or sports journalists) and novices. Moreover, performance between athletes and the other groups differed before the ball was seen to leave the model's hands, suggesting that athletes predicted the basket shot's fate by reading the body kinematics. Both visuo-motor and visual experts showed a selective increase of motor-evoked potentials during observation of basket shots. However, only athletes showed a time-specific motor activation during observation of erroneous basket throws. Results suggest that achieving excellence in sports may be related to the fine-tuning of specific anticipatory 'resonance' mechanisms that endow elite athletes' brains with the ability to predict others' actions ahead of their realization.", "pages": "4270-3"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Combined use of non-invasive techniques for improved functional localization for a selected group of epilepsy surgery candidates.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19159694", "authors": ["Vitikainen, AM", "Lioumis, P", "Paetau, R", "Salli, E", "Komssi, S", "Mets\u00e4honkala, L", "Paetau, A", "Kici\u0107, D", "Blomstedt, G", "Valanne, L", "M\u00e4kel\u00e4, JP", "Gaily, E"], "year": "2009", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Invasive cortical mapping is conventionally required for preoperative identification of epileptogenic and eloquent cortical regions before epilepsy surgery. The decision on the extent and exact location of the resection is always demanding and multimodal approach is desired for added certainty. The present study describes two non-invasive preoperative protocols, used in addition to the normal preoperative work-up for localization of the epileptogenic and sensorimotor cortical regions, in two young patients with epilepsy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to determine the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the ictal onset zones. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) was used to determine the location and the extent of the primary motor representation areas. The localization results from these non-invasive methods were used for guiding the subdural grid deployment and later compared with the results from electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) via subdural grids, and validated by surgery outcome. The results from MEG and nTMS localizations were consistent with the ECS results and provided improved spatial precision. Consistent results of our study suggest that these non-invasive methods can be added to the standard preoperative work-up and may even hold a potential to replace the ECS in a subgroup of patients with epilepsy who have the suspected epileptogenic zone near the sensorimotor cortex and seizures frequent enough for ictal MEG.", "pages": "4270-3"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "On the calculation of transcallosal conduction time using transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "19152734", "authors": ["Deftereos, SN", "Panagopoulos, G", "Georgonikou, D", "Karageorgiou, E", "Andriopoulos, P", "Karageorgiou, CE"], "year": "", "journal": "Functional neurology", "abstract": "Transcallosal conduction time (TCT), based on the results of transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, is currently calculated as a function of the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) and of the motor evoked potential (MEP) obtained from a target muscle (TCTcurrent = iSP latency - MEP latency).

It is an excellent technique that complements other non-invasive methods for studying human brain physiology. The aim of the present study was to review the basic concepts and principles of the repetitive TMS (rTMS) technique, gathering evidence of its applications in neurorehabilitation. Several clinical studies have reported that sessions of rTMS can improve some or all of the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, dystonia and stroke. However, since these changes are transient, it is premature to propose these applications as realistic therapeutic options, even though the rTMS technique has shown itself to be, potentially, a modulator of sensorimotor integration and neurogenesis. Future work in this area promises to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide range of neurological conditions, generate widely applicable diagnostic tools for clinical neurophysiology, and perhaps establish neuromodulation as a viable therapeutic option in neurorehabilitation.", "pages": "4270-3"}, {"volume": "132", "title": "Disordered plasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex in focal hand dystonia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "19151081", "authors": ["Tamura, Y", "Ueki, Y", "Lin, P", "Vorbach, S", "Mima, T", "Kakigi, R", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Interventional paired associative stimulation (PAS) can induce plasticity in the cortex, and this plasticity was previously shown to be disordered in the primary motor cortex in focal hand dystonia (FHD).

Ten FHD patients and 10 healthy volunteers were studied. We investigated the changes in single- and double-pulse somatosensory-evoked potentials before and after PAS, which consisted of peripheral electrical nerve stimulation and subsequent transcranial magnetic stimulation over S1. Four sessions of somatosensory-evoked potentials recordings were performed: before PAS, and immediately, 15 and 30 min after PAS. We compared the time course of the somatosensory-evoked potentials between the FHD and healthy groups. In the single-pulse condition, the P27 amplitudes were significantly higher in FHD immediately after PAS than before PAS, while no changes were observed in healthy subjects. In the double-pulse condition, significant differences in the suppression ratio of P27 were found immediately after and 15 min after PAS, while there were no significant differences in healthy subjects. The P27 suppression tended to normalize toward the level of the healthy volunteer group. In FHD, PAS transiently induced an abnormal increase in excitability in S1. In addition, intracortical inhibition in S1 was found to increase as well. This abnormal plasticity of the intracortical neurons in S1 may contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia.", "pages": "4270-3"}, {"volume": "120", "title": "Sensory afferent inhibition within and between limbs in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9651498", "authors": ["Bikmullina, R", "B\u00e4umer, T", "Zittel, S", "M\u00fcnchau, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To examine the distribution and inter-limb interaction of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) in the arm and leg.", "pages": "4270-3"}]
