Numerous studies have investigated the effects of rTMS on cortical excitability and inhibition, yielding somewhat contradictory results. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively review this literature to guide the selection of methodology in therapeutic studies. We conducted a comprehensive review of all identified studies that investigated effects of low and/or high frequency rTMS on motor cortical excitability or inhibition. Low frequency rTMS appears to produce a transient reduction in cortical excitability as assessed by motor evoked potential (MEP) size and produces no substantial effect on cortical inhibition. High frequency rTMS appears to produce a persistent increase in MEP size and a reduction in cortical inhibition measured with paired pulse methods although few studies have investigated frequencies greater than 5Hz. A number of novel stimulation paradigms have significant potential for altering cortical excitability but require further investigation. Although commonly applied forms of rTMS have effects on cortical excitability, more substantial effects may be obtained through the use of novel stimulation paradigms or innovative approaches to the stimulation of areas connected to a potential target site. Further research is required, however, before these paradigms can be more widely adopted.", "pages": "2584-96"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Anticonvulsant effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) in the rat cortical ramp model of focal epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "16886986", "authors": ["Liebetanz, D", "Klinker, F", "Hering, D", "Koch, R", "Nitsche, MA", "Potschka, H", "L\u00f6scher, W", "Paulus, W", "Tergau, F"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Epilepsia", "abstract": "Weak direct currents induce lasting alterations of cortical excitability in animals and humans, which are controlled by polarity, duration of stimulation, and current strength applied.

To investigate the relation of both signals, we compared visually evoked potentials (VEP) with evoked flow velocity responses in the posterior cerebral artery by performing different visual stimulation tasks in healthy students. Check sizes and flickering frequency of a checkerboard pattern and the radial visual field section of a dartboard pattern were varied. VEPs were expressed in amplitude differences. Hemodynamic changes were given in terms of a control system model specifying the gain, attenuation, natural frequency and rate time parameters. From the typical VEP amplitude differences, we found the early N75-P100 amplitude difference significantly correlated to the gain parameter of the hemodynamic response. Both parameters increased with higher complexity of the checkerboard pattern and increasing visual field sections, whereas they remained nearly stable in the chosen frequency range. To corroborate the hypothesis of a tight coupling, further studies have to prove if the strength of this coupling could be used in clinical conditions.", "pages": "2584-96"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Monitoring of scoliosis surgery with epidurally recorded motor evoked potentials (D wave) revealed false results.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "16844406", "authors": ["Ulkatan, S", "Neuwirth, M", "Bitan, F", "Minardi, C", "Kokoszka, A", "Deletis, V"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In order to study systemic brain reactions on transcranial electrical or electromagnetic medical stimulation and specify the neurophysiological criteria of its efficiency, comparative clinical and experimental examination was performed with the analysis of spontaneous bioelectric activity and behavioral or clinical parameters.

Basic concepts regarding the need for this modality of monitoring, the anatomy of the pathways involved, and the mechanisms of waveform propagation are addressed.
