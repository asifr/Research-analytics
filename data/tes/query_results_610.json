We hypothesized that changes in excitability by tDCS, found to improve cognitive functions dependent on moderate prefrontal cortex activity, would operate similarly in animals as in humans. To verify this we performed experiments using a rat behavioral model of visuospatial working memory and skill learning paired with tDCS of the frontal cortex. The effect of anodal/cathodal tDCS was examined in three sessions using the allothetic place avoidance alternation task (APAAT) and later re-examined without stimulation. Stimulation had no measurable short term effect on on-going place avoidance learning. However, in the follow-up session on day 21 the rats previously treated with cathodal tDCS showed significantly more efficient place avoidance and skill retention in comparison to the controls. This demonstrates a long-term benefit of diminished excitability by frontal tDCS when paired with training on working memory and skill learning in a novel task. The presented behavioral model provides a tool to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of how tDCS modulates neural network function to support successful behavior.", "pages": "452-60"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "How the brain tissue shapes the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "21749927", "authors": ["Opitz, A", "Windhoff, M", "Heidemann, RM", "Turner, R", "Thielscher, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), knowledge of the distribution of the induced electric field is fundamental for a better understanding of the position and extent of the stimulated brain region. However, the different tissue types and the varying fibre orientation in the brain tissue result in an inhomogeneous and anisotropic conductivity distribution and distort the electric field in a non-trivial way. Here, the field induced by a figure-8 coil is characterized in detail using finite element calculations and a geometrically accurate model of an individual head combined with high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging for conductivity mapping. It is demonstrated that the field strength is significantly enhanced when the currents run approximately perpendicular to the local gyral orientation. Importantly, the spatial distribution of this effect differs distinctly between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM): While the field in GM is selectively enhanced at the gyral crowns and lips, high field strengths can still occur rather deep in WM. Taking the anisotropy of brain tissue into account tends to further boost this effect in WM, but not in GM. Spatial variations in the WM anisotropy affect the local field strength in a systematic way and result in localized increases of up to 40% (on average ~7% for coil orientations perpendicular to the underlying gyri). We suggest that these effects might create hot spots in WM that might contribute to the excitation of WM structures by TMS. However, our results also demonstrate the necessity of using realistic nerve models in the future to allow for more definitive conclusions.", "pages": "452-60"}, {"volume": "106", "title": "Modification of loco-regional microenvironment in brain tumors by spinal cord stimulation.

We summarize our experience of the influence of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on this micro-environment. Patients with HGG (n = 26) were assessed pre- and post-SCS, using: (1) Doppler in middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and (2) in common carotid arteries (CCA); (3) tumor blood-flow using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); (4) tumor-pO(2) (mmHg) using polarographic probes (eight tumor areas from five patients); and (5) tumor glucose metabolism using (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ((18)FDG) positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET). Pre-SCS: tumor blood-flow was lower (P < 0.001) than peri-tumor areas and healthy contra-lateral areas. Tumor-pO(2) was lower (P < 0.042) than healthy tissue. Tumor glucose metabolism was higher than peri-tumor areas (P = 0.017) and healthy contra-lateral areas (P = 0.048). Post-SCS: there were increases in: MCA blood-flow (P \u2264 0.002), CCA blood-flow (P \u2264 0.013), tumor blood-flow (P = 0.033), tumor glucose metabolism (P = 0.027) and tumor-pO(2) (P = 0.022). The percentage of hypoxic values decreased (P = 0.007). SCS can modify tumor micro-environment. The potential usefulness of SCS in improving the effectiveness of radio-chemotherapy in HGG needs to be evaluated.", "pages": "452-60"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "Effect of median-nerve electrical stimulation on BOLD activity in acute ischemic stroke patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "21741301", "authors": ["Manganotti, P", "Storti, SF", "Formaggio, E", "Acler, M", "Zoccatelli, G", "Pizzini, FB", "Alessandrini, F", "Bertoldo, A", "Toffolo, GM", "Bovi, P", "Beltramello, A", "Moretto, G", "Fiaschi, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time.", "pages": "452-60"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "[Penetrating needling on head points for vertigo caused by vertebral-basilar arterial blood-supply insufficiency].", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "21739689", "authors": ["Qi, XJ", "Wang, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion", "abstract": "Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 12-48 h after stroke.
