Our goal was to evaluate, for different levels and severity of spinal cord injury, potential differences in the distribution and latency of motor responses in a large sample of muscles affected by the injury. The spinal cord injury (SCI) population was divided into subgroups based upon injury location (cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar) and clinical status (motor-complete versus motor-incomplete). Cortical stimuli were delivered while subjects attempted to contract individual muscles, in order to both maximize the probability of a response to TMS and minimize the response latency. Subjects with motor-incomplete injuries to the cervical or thoracic spinal cord were more likely to demonstrate volitional and TMS-evoked contractions in muscles controlling their foot and ankle (i.e., distal lower limb muscles) compared to muscles of the thigh (i.e., proximal lower limb muscles). When TMS did evoke responses in muscles innervated at levels caudal to the spinal cord lesion, response latencies of muscles in the lower limbs were delayed equally for persons with injury to the cervical or thoracic spinal cord, suggesting normal central motor conduction velocity in motor axons caudal to the lesion. In fact, motor response distribution and latencies were essentially indistinguishable for injuries to the cervical or thoracic (at or rostral to T10) levels of the spine. In contrast, motor-incomplete SCI subjects with injuries at the thoracolumbar level showed a higher probability of preserved volitional movements and TMS-evoked contractions in proximal muscles of the lower limb, and absent responses in distal muscles. When responses to TMS were seen in this group, the latencies were not significantly longer than those of able-bodied (AB) subjects, strongly suggestive of \"root sparing\" as a basis for motor function in subjects with injury at or caudal to the T11 vertebral body. Both the distribution and latency of TMS-evoked responses are consistent with highly focal lesions to the spinal cord in the subjects examined. The pattern of preserved responsiveness predominating in the distal leg muscles is consistent with a greater role of corticospinal tract innervation of these muscles compared to more proximal muscles of the thigh and hip.", "pages": "49-67"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Task-dependent modulation of inhibitory actions within the primary motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9989438", "authors": ["Hess, A", "Kunesch, E", "Classen, J", "Hoeppner, J", "Stefan, K", "Benecke, R"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Of the natural motor tasks, duration of SPs of small hand muscles was longest during tactile exploration (APB 205+/-42 ms; FDI 213+/-47 ms). SP duration at tonic isometric contraction amounted to 172+/-35 ms in APB and 178+/-31 ms in FDI, respectively. SP duration in FDI was shortest when elicited during visually guided isometric finger movements (159+/-15 ms). At tonic isometric contraction, SP was shortened when PES was applied at latencies -30 to +70 ms in conjunction with TMS. The latter effect was most pronounced when PES was applied 20 ms before TMS. PES-induced effects increased with increasing stimulation strength up to a saturation level which appeared at the transition to painful stimulation strengths. Both isolated stimulation of muscle afferents and of low-threshold cutaneous afferents shortened SP duration. However, PES of the contralateral median nerve had no effect on SPs. Amplitudes of MEPs did not change significantly in any condition. Inhibitory control of motor output circuitries seems to be distinctly modulated by peripheral somatosensory and visual afferent information. We conclude that somatosensory information has privileged access to inhibitory interneuronal circuits within the primary motor cortex.", "pages": "49-67"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "The time-course of preparatory spinal and cortico-spinal inhibition: an H-reflex and transcranial magnetic stimulation study in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9928787", "authors": ["Hasbroucq, T", "Kaneko, H", "Akamatsu, M", "Possama\u00ef, CA"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "In a previous study where reaction-time methods were combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex, cortico-spinal excitability was shown to reflect time preparation. Provided that subjects can accurately estimate time, the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) diminish progressively during the interval separating the warning signal from the response signal (i.e., the foreperiod). On the other hand, several experiments have demonstrated that the amplitude of the Hoffman (H) reflex elicited in prime movers diminishes during the foreperiod of reaction-time tasks. The aim of the present study was to compare the time course of the respective decrements of H-reflex and MEP amplitude during a constant 500-ms foreperiod. The subjects (n=8) participated in two experimental sessions. In one session, H-reflexes were induced in a tonically activated, responding hand muscle, the flexor pollicis brevis, at different times during the foreperiod of a visual-choice reaction-time task. In the other session, motor potentials were evoked in the same muscle by TMS of the motor cortex delivered in the same behavioral conditions and at the same times as in the first session. The results show that both H-reflexes and MEPs diminish in amplitude during the foreperiod, which replicates and extends previous findings. Interestingly, the time constants of the two decrements differed. There was a facilitatory effect of both electrical and magnetic stimulations on the subject's performance: reaction time was shorter for the trials during which a stimulation was delivered than for the no-stimulation trials. This facilitation was maximal when the stimulations were delivered simultaneously with the warning signal and vanished progressively with stimulation time.", "pages": "49-67"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Motor-evoked potentials elicited from human erector spinae muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9926386", "authors": ["Taniguchi, S", "Tani, T"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "The compound muscle action potentials elicited from the erector spinae muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation was studied in 15 healthy adults.", "pages": "49-67"}, {"volume": "173", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9926070", "authors": ["Reid, PD", "Shajahan, PM", "Glabus, MF", "Ebmeier, KP"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "To describe the recording procedure for consistent compound muscle action potentials elicited from the human erector spinae by transcranial magnetic stimulation and to establish the normal latency ranges of the responses, at respective spinal levels, for the practical use of this test.", "pages": "49-67"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with implanted deep brain stimulators.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9918361", "authors": ["Kumar, R", "Chen, R", "Ashby, P"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Although recording of the compound muscle action potentials from limb muscles after transcranial magnetic stimulation has been extensively studied, the use of the erector spinae as the target muscle has not, probably because of the difficulty of consistently evoking compound muscle action potentials.", "pages": "49-67"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Within-patient variability of myogenic motor-evoked potentials to multipulse transcranial electrical stimulation during two levels of partial neuromuscular blockade in aortic surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9895060", "authors": ["van Dongen, EP", "ter Beek, HT", "Schepens, MA", "Morshuis, WJ", "Langemeijer, HJ", "de Boer, A", "Boezeman, EH"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Compound muscle action potentials from the erector spinae muscles were recorded with the subject prone during tonic voluntary background contraction of the back extensor muscles at approximately 20% of maximum effort.

Ten patients (30-76 yr) scheduled to undergo surgery on the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta were studied. After achieving a stable anesthetic state and before surgery, 10 tcMEPs were recorded from the right extensor digitorum communis muscle and the right tibialis anterior muscle in response to two-pulse and six-pulse transcranial electrical stimulation with an interstimulus interval of 2 ms during two levels of neuromuscular blockade. The right thenar eminence was used for recording the level of relaxation. The tcMEP amplitude using the six-pulse paradigm was larger (P < 0.01; leg and arm) compared with the amplitude evoked by two-pulse stimulation during both levels of relaxation. The within-patient variability, expressed as median coefficient of variation, was less when six-pulse stimulation was used. At a T1 response of 45%-55% of baseline, larger, less variable tcMEPs were recorded than at a T1 response of 5%-15%. Our results suggest that the best quality of tcMEP signals (tibialis anterior muscle) is obtained when the six-pulse paradigm is used with a stable level of muscle relaxation (the first twitch of the TOF-thenar eminence-at 45%-55% of baseline).", "pages": "49-67"}]
