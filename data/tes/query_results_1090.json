In general, the positive electrode is applied in the region above the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (i.e., F3 region of the 10/20 International System for EEG) and the negative electrode is applied in the region above the right supra-orbital area. A direct electrical current of 1-2 mA is then applied between the electrodes for about 20 minutes, with sessions being daily performed for one to two weeks. Initial studies (including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial) showed that transcranial direct current stimulation is effective for the treatment of non-complicated major depression and that this technique, when used in depressed patients, is associated with improvement in cognitive performance (including working memory). Finally, transcranial direct current stimulation is safe and well tolerated.", "pages": "S34-8"}, {"volume": "197", "title": "TMS disruption of V5/MT+ indicates a role for the dorsal stream in word recognition.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10332104", "authors": ["Laycock, R", "Crewther, DP", "Fitzgerald, PB", "Crewther, SG"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Thirteen epilepsy patients with severe cerebral hemiatrophy or unilateral malformation were studied before operation using MEPs recorded on bilateral abductor pollicis brevis (APBs) muscles, elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. Ten subjects served as controls. Results: (1) no ipsilateral MEP responses were recorded in all the 10 healthy subjects; (2) in the 13 patients, the results of MEPs could be divided into four types. Type A: in 3 patients bilateral MEPs were recorded when unaffected hemisphere was stimulated, while no responses were elicited when the affected hemisphere was stimulated. Type B: in another 3 patients, the MEPs were elicited from bilateral APB muscles when the unaffected hemisphere was stimulated, and the contralateral MEP was also elicited when the affected hemisphere was stimulated. Type C: in two patients contralateral MEP was elicited when the unaffected hemisphere was stimulated, while no MEP was induced in APB muscles of either side following the affected hemisphere stimulation. Type D: in the remaining 5 patients, contralateral magnetic MEPs were elicited either when the affected or the unaffected hemisphere was stimulated. Patients of type A, B and C received hemispherectomy showed no significant permanent motor functional deficit. Among the total 8 patients, 7 patients got seizure free after the operation. Patients of type D showed minor muscle strength decrease after localized cortical resection. Three out of 5 patients of type D got seizure free after the operation. Ipsilateral MEP response might be useful for neurosurgeons to plan appropriate surgical procedure which helps avoid post-operative motor deficits.", "pages": "S34-8"}]
