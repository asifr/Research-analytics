Based on literature review and illustrative clinical experience, this tutorial aims to present a balanced overview for experienced practitioners, surgeons and anesthesiologists as well as those new to the field. It details the physiologic basis, indications and methodology of current MEP monitoring techniques, evaluates their safety, explores interpretive controversies and outlines some applications and results, including aortic aneurysm, intramedullary spinal cord tumor, spinal deformity, posterior fossa tumor, intracranial aneurysm and peri-rolandic brain surgeries. The many advances in motor system assessment achieved in the last two decades undoubtedly improve monitoring efficacy without unduly compromising safety. Future studies and experience will likely clarify existing controversies and bring further advances.", "pages": "347-77"}, {"volume": "575", "title": "Rapid-rate paired associative stimulation of the median nerve and motor cortex can produce long-lasting changes in motor cortical excitability in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "16825301", "authors": ["Quartarone, A", "Rizzo, V", "Bagnato, S", "Morgante, F", "Sant'Angelo, A", "Girlanda, P", "Siebner, HR"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or repetitive electrical peripheral nerve stimulation (rENS) can induce changes in the excitability of the human motor cortex (M1) that is often short-lasting and variable, and occurs only after prolonged periods of stimulation. In 10 healthy volunteers, we used a new repetitive paired associative stimulation (rPAS) protocol to facilitate and prolong the effects of rENS and rTMS on cortical excitability. Sub-motor threshold 5 Hz rENS of the right median nerve was synchronized with submotor threshold 5 Hz rTMS of the left M1 at a constant interval for 2 min. The interstimulus interval (ISI) between the peripheral stimulus and the transcranial stimulation was set at 10 ms (5 Hz rPAS10ms) or 25 ms (5 Hz rPAS25ms). TMS was given over the hot spot of the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. Before and after rPAS, we measured the amplitude of the unconditioned motor evoked potential (MEP), intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF), short- and long-latency afferent inhibition (SAI and LAI) in the conditioned M1. The 5 Hz rPAS25ms protocol but not the 5 Hz rPAS10ms protocol caused a somatotopically specific increase in mean MEP amplitudes in the relaxed APB muscle. The 5 Hz rPAS25ms protocol also led to a loss of SAI, but there was no correlation between individual changes in SAI and corticospinal excitability. These after-effects were still present 6 h after 5 Hz rPAS25ms. There was no consistent effect on ICI, ICF and LAI. The 5 Hz rENS and 5 Hz rTMS protocols failed to induce any change in corticospinal excitability when given alone. These findings show that 2 min of 5 Hz rPAS25ms produce a long-lasting and somatotopically specific increase in corticospinal excitability, presumably by sensorimotor disinhibition.", "pages": "347-77"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Noninvasive cortical stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "10802449", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Boggio, PS", "Santos, MC", "Lima, M", "Vieira, AL", "Rigonatti, SP", "Silva, MT", "Barbosa, ER", "Nitsche, MA", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of deep brain structures, such as globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, is widely accepted as a therapeutic tool for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cortical stimulation either with epidural implanted electrodes or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can be associated with motor function enhancement in PD. We aimed to study the effects of another noninvasive technique of cortical brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), on motor function and motor-evoked potential (MEP) characteristics of PD patients. We tested tDCS using different electrode montages [anodal stimulation of primary motor cortex (M1), cathodal stimulation of M1, anodal stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sham-stimulation] and evaluated the effects on motor function--as indexed by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), simple reaction time (sRT) and Purdue Pegboard test--and on corticospinal motor excitability (MEP characteristics). All experiments were performed in a double-blinded manner. Anodal stimulation of M1 was associated with a significant improvement of motor function compared to sham-stimulation in the UPDRS (P < 0.001) and sRT (P = 0.019). This effect was not observed for cathodal stimulation of M1 or anodal stimulation of DLPFC. Furthermore, whereas anodal stimulation of M1 significantly increased MEP amplitude and area, cathodal stimulation of M1 significantly decreased them. There was a trend toward a significant correlation between motor function improvement after M1 anodal-tDCS and MEP area increase. These results confirm and extend the notion that cortical brain stimulation might improve motor function in patients with PD.", "pages": "347-77"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "The effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on symptoms in obsessive compulsive disorder.

In two beagle dogs, Tic-ESCPs were recorded at the left twelfth intercostal to fourth lumbar nerves following stimulation at the left eleventh intercostal nerve, either with or without the use of a muscle relaxant. The amplitude and latency of the Tic-ESCP waves were then measured and compared with those of conventional transcranial spinal motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Tic-ESCPs could be obtained at any nerve, with or without the use of a muscle relaxant. The Tic-ESCP waveform was clear and simple, consisting of a small positive (P1) wave and a subsequent large negative (N1) wave. As the site of recording moved farther from the stimulation site, the N1 amplitudes were reduced and the P1 latency was prolonged. Under muscle relaxation, the N1 amplitudes were reduced, and the P1 latencies were shorter. As compared with MEPs, Tic-ESCPs could be evoked by a weaker stimulus, the N1 amplitude was smaller, and the P1 latency was shorter. Tic-ESCP recording was feasible either with or without the use of a muscle relaxant. The Tic-ESCPs showed simple and clear waveforms with smaller stimulations.

It can enhance motor learning and working memory in healthy subjects. To investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (1 mA, 20 min) of the dominant and non-dominant primary motor cortex (M1) on hand motor performance in healthy right-handed volunteers, healthy subjects underwent one session of both sham and active anodal stimulation of the non-dominant or dominant primary motor cortex. A blinded rater assessed motor function using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. For the non-dominant hand, active tDCS was able to improve motor function significantly-there was a significant interaction between time and condition of stimulation (p = 0.003). Post hoc tests showed a significant enhancement of JTT performance after 1 mA anodal tDCS of M1 (mean improvement of 9.41%, p = 0.0004), but not after sham tDCS (mean improvement of 1.3%, p = 0.84). For the dominant hand, however, neither active nor sham tDCS resulted in a significant change in motor performance. Our findings show that anodal tDCS of the non-dominant primary motor cortex results in motor function enhancement and thus confirm and extend the notion that tDCS can change behavior. We speculate that the under-use of the non-dominant hand with its associated consequences in cortical plasticity might be one of the reasons to explain motor performance enhancement in the non-dominant hand only.", "pages": "347-77"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "The age of neuroelectronics.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "12151785", "authors": ["Keiper, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "New Atlantis (Washington, D.C.)", "abstract": "Aim of this study was to investigate whether paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) applied over the medial frontal cortex (MFC) affects acute Adelta fiber-mediated electrically induced pain.
