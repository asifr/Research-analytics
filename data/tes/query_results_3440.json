Activation of a focal region of motor cortex can also give rise to a transient depression of function. If a subject, or patient, is trying to produce movement, this depression would lead to a brief lapse in muscle activation that would be interpreted as either asterixis or negative myoclonus. Both positive events and negative events can occur either individually or together. The physiological substrate in the cortex appears to be different for the two phenomena, and the pharmacology may differ as well.", "pages": "107-13"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Long-lasting depression of motor-evoked potentials to transcranial magnetic stimulation following exercise.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8751065", "authors": ["Zanette, G", "Bonato, C", "Polo, A", "Tinazzi, M", "Manganotti, P", "Fiaschi, A"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Eleven healthy subjects aged 24-32 years were evaluated. Serial motor-evoked potential (MEP) recordings were performed from the right thenar eminence every 5 min for a period of 20 min at rest and for a period of 35 min after repetitive abduction-adduction of the thumb at maximal frequency for 1 min. All subjects presented distinct changes in MEP amplitude after exercise with an approximately 55% mean maximal decrease compared with basal conditions and complete recovery 35 min after the end of the exercise. The time course of MEP amplitude changes presented the following trend: (1) a rapid decrease phase within the first 5 min; (2) a maximal depression phase of 10 min duration (from the 5th to the 15th min); and (3) a slow recovery phase. No significant modifications in post-exercise MEP amplitude were found in ipsilateral non-exercised muscles. In order to determine the level where these changes take place, we recorded the M and F waves induced by median nerve stimulation at the wrist (all subjects) and MEPs in response to transcranial electrical stimulation (five subjects) at rest and during the decrease and maximal depression phases. None of these tests were significantly affected by exercise, indicating that the motor cortex was the site of change. Evaluation of maps of cortical outputs to the target muscle, performed in four subjects, showed an approximately 40% spatial reduction in stimulation sites evoking a motor response during the maximal depression phase. These data prove that exercise induces a reversible, long-standing depression of cortical excitability, probably related to intracortical presynaptic modulation, which transitorily reduces the motor representation area.", "pages": "107-13"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Cortical stimulation and reflex excitability of spinal cord neurones in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "8695046", "authors": ["Sabatino, M", "Sardo, P", "Iurato, L", "La Grutta, V"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission. General section", "abstract": "The H reflex technique was used to evaluate the influence exerted by cortical conditioning on the excitability of the alpha-motoneurone pool and on IA interneuronal activity (reciprocal inhibition). In ten subjects at absolute rest electrical and magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex was transcranially applied during flexor carpi radialis H reflex eliciting and in conditions of reciprocal inhibition induced by radial nerve stimulation. The time courses showed that at intensities below motor threshold, electrical brain conditioning induced an increase in the amplitude of the test reflex when the cortical shock was given 4 ms after the test H reflex. On the contrary, reciprocal inhibition was reduced by electrical cortical conditioning when the scalp stimulation was applied 2-3 ms after the test stimulus. Magnetic transcranial stimulation induced an increase of H reflex amplitude when the test shock was administered 5 and 2 ms prior to the scalp shock; it did not modify the degree of reciprocal inhibition. The experimental findings could be considered the electrophysiological manifestation of a differential cortico-spinal control on the pathway alpha-motoneurone/IA interneurone. Considerations on the delay allow the hypothesis of a further synapse between the cortico-spinal ending and the IA interneurone.

Eighty-six patients were examined clinically and neurophysiologically immediately on presentation to Tampere University Hospital. Electroneuronography (ENoG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were performed 1-6 times for each patient. The time interval between each examination varied from 2 to 7 days. Seventy-eight patients were followed for a median period of 13 months after the onset of palsy. Facial nerve function was graded according to the House-Brackmann grading system. Relative amplitude differences of ENoG and TMS during the acute phase were then correlated with clinical outcome. Statistical analysis of the results showed that a TMS response elicitable during the first 5 days of the palsy was correlatable with a good prognosis. ENoG results correlated with clinical outcome at a later time from onset of symptoms. TMS was well tolerated and no adverse effects were seen.

Such soleus evoked motor responses (EMRs) were characterised over a wide range of background levels of motor activity and using different stimulus intensities. EMRs were recorded during predominantly (1) volitional and (2) postural tasks. In the former task subjects were seated and voluntarily produced prescribed levels of soleus activation by reference to a visual monitor of EMG. In the latter task subjects assumed standing postures without EMG feedback. Comparison of the EMRs of soleus, traditionally considered a slow anti-gravity extensor muscle, during these tasks was used to evaluate its cortical control in primarily volitional versus primarily postural activities. The form of soleus EMRs produced by single magnetic cortical stimuli comprised an initial (approx. 30 ms) increase and subsequent (approx. 50 ms) depression of EMG. Cortical stimulation could elicit substantial excitatory soleus EMG responses; for example, responses evoked by mild, magnetic stimuli (125% threshold for inducing a response in the relaxed muscle) as subjects exerted full voluntary plantarflexor effort averaged almost 20% of the maximum M-wave which could be elicited by an electrical stimulus to the posterior tibial nerve. Excitatory EMRs could be elicited in the voluntarily relaxed soleus muscle of the majority of subjects during sitting. The amplitude of soleus responses, induced by threshold stimuli for the relaxed state or approximately 125% threshold intensity, increased approximately linearly with background EMG over a wide range of volitional contraction levels. By contrast, there was no systematic change in the latency of excitatory soleus EMRs with increasing voluntary effort. The excitatory responses evoked in the voluntarily relaxed soleus of seated subjects by magnetic stimulation were regularly facilitated by incremental, voluntary contraction of the contralateral ankle extensors in a graded manner. However, such facilitation of responses was not observed when subjects voluntarily activated the muscle in which EMRs were elicited. The pattern of the responses elicited in soleus by magnetic stimulation during the postural task generally resembled that found during the volitional task. The amplitudes of excitatory soleus EMRs at a given stimulus intensity, obtained when subjects stood quietly, leaned forwards or stood on their toes to produce differing levels of ankle extensor contraction, increased with background EMG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "107-13"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "[Reliability of magnetic stimulation in the diagnosis of peripheral facial paralysis of idiopathic origin].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "7569373", "authors": ["Schrader, M", "Schrader, V"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Revue de laryngologie - otologie - rhinologie", "abstract": "To evaluate the transcranial magnetic stimulation in the early diagnosis of traumatic facial palsy 7 patients with an incomplete Bell's palsy were examined.

The mean latency of the surface potential of the orbicularis oculi muscle after electrical stimulation was 2.7 msec. On the healthy side the answer following transcranial ipsilateral cisternal magnetic stimulation was detectable after 6.8 msec. From the beginning no response could be recorded on the affected side.

Five healthy male subjects, aged 37.4 +/- 4.2 years (mean +/- SE), were seated in a chair equipped with a load cell to measure dorsiflexion force. TMS or TES was delivered over the scalp vertex before and after a fatiguing MVC, which was maintained until force decreased by 50%. MEPs were recorded by surface electrodes placed over quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus muscles bilaterally. M-waves were elicited from the exercised TA by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve. H-reflex and MVC recovery after fatiguing, sustained MVC were also studied independently in additional sessions. TMS-induced MEPs were significantly reduced for 20 min following MVC, but only in the exercised TA muscle. Comparing TMS and TES mean MEP amplitudes, we found that, over the first 5 min following the fatiguing MVC, they were decreased by about 55% for each. M-wave responses were unchanged. H-reflex amplitude and MVC force recovered within the 1st min following the fatiguing MVC. When neuromuscular fatigue was induced by tetanic motor point stimulation of the TA, TMS-induced MEP amplitudes remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the observed decrease in MEP amplitude represents a focal reduction of cortical excitability following a fatiguing motor task and may be caused by intracortical and/or subcortical inhibitory mechanisms.", "pages": "107-13"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "[The effect of transcranial electrostimulation on initial alcoholic motivation in rats].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "7489002", "authors": ["Zav'ialov, AV", "Khokhlova, LI"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Fiziologicheski\u012d zhurnal imeni I.M.
