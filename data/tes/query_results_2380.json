However, there is emerging evidence that linguistic tasks may alter excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways also. In this study we evaluated the effect of several movement-free, low-level linguistic processes involved in reading and writing on the excitability of the bilateral corticospinal motor pathways in a group of right-handed subjects. The study included two series of tasks, visual searching/matching and imaginal writing/drawing. The tasks were designed to roughly correspond with elemental aspects of the reading and writing, grapheme recognition and grapheme generation, respectively. Each task series included separate blocks with different task targets: letters, digits, semantically easy-to-code (i.e. geometric) shapes, and semantically hard-to-code shapes, as well as control blocks with no task. During task performance, TMS was delivered randomly over the hand area of either the left or right motor cortex and the modulation of the excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways was measured bilaterally through changes of the size of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) induced in the relaxed right and left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. We found that the size of the MEP in hand muscles increased during visual searching/matching tasks, particularly when targets were letters or geometric shapes, and the increase was significant for the dominant hand (left hemisphere) only. No such consistent effects were seen across subjects during imaginal tasks. This study provides evidence that even the performance of certain low-level linguistic tasks can modulate the excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways, particularly those originating from the left (dominant) hemisphere, despite the absence of overt motor activity. Moreover, in the light of the recently increased awareness of the role of \"mirror neurons\" in perception, the results suggest that activation of motor circuits used in generation of the written output may be an essential part of the perception of the written material as well. Understanding the patterns of task-dependent changes in excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways will provide insights into the organisation of central nervous system functional networks involved in linguistic processes, and may also be useful for future development of novel approaches to rehabilitation therapy of linguistic and motor functions.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "90", "title": "Changes in segmental and motor cortical output with contralateral muscle contractions and altered sensory inputs in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "14534271", "authors": ["Hortob\u00e1gyi, T", "Taylor, JL", "Petersen, NT", "Russell, G", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Motor or sensory activity in one arm can affect the other arm. We tested the hypothesis that a voluntary contraction can affect the motor pathway to the contralateral homologous muscle and investigated whether alterations in sensory input might mediate such effects. Responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation [motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)], stimulation of the descending tracts [cervicomedullary MEPs (CMEPs)], and peripheral nerve stimulation (H-reflex) were recorded from the relaxed right flexor carpi radialis (FCR), while the left arm underwent unilateral interventions (5 s duration) that included voluntary contraction, muscle contraction evoked through percutaneous stimulation, tendon vibration, and cutaneous and mixed nerve stimulation. During moderate to strong voluntary wrist flexion on the left, MEPs in the right FCR increased, CMEPs were unaffected, and the H-reflex was depressed. These results are consistent with an increase in excitability of the motor cortex, no effect on the motoneuron pool, and presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. In contrast, percutaneous muscle stimulation facilitated both MEPs and the H-reflex. However, muscle contraction produced by a combination of voluntary effort and electrical stimulation also reduced the contralateral H-reflex. After voluntary contractions, the H-reflex remained depressed for 35 s, but after stimulation-evoked contractions, it rapidly returned to baseline. Under both conditions, MEPs recovered rapidly. After voluntary contractions, CMEPs were also depressed for approximately 10 s despite their lack of change during contractions. Wrist tendon vibration (100 Hz) did not affect, and 20-Hz median nerve stimulation or forearm medial cutaneous nerve stimulation mildly facilitated, the H-reflex without affecting MEPs. Voluntary wrist extension, similarly to wrist flexion, increased MEPs and depressed H-reflexes. However, ankle dorsiflexion facilitated the H-reflex akin to the Jendrassik maneuver. These data suggest that a unilateral voluntary muscle contraction has contralateral effects at both cortical and segmental levels and that the segmental effects are not replicated by stimulated muscle contraction or by input from muscle spindles or non-nociceptive cutaneous afferents.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Relationship between lamotrigine oral dose, serum level and its inhibitory effect on CNS: insights from transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14529954", "authors": ["Tergau, F", "Wischer, S", "Somal, HS", "Nitsche, MA", "Mercer, AJ", "Paulus, W", "Steinhoff, BJ"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "The antiepileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) is known to reduce cortical excitability evaluated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We investigated the relationship between LTG oral dosages, serum levels and inhibitory effects on resting motor threshold (RMT), a parameter of motor system excitability assessed by TMS. In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study 16 male volunteers received 325 mg LTG as a single dose, as bi-hourly graded cumulative dose, or placebo. RMT and serum levels were measured before and after 2-8 h. With single dose, RMT elevation showed a poor but significant correlation to serum levels. With graded dose, serum levels as well as RMT increased dose-dependently with significant (P<0.0001) linear correlation. However, detailed comparison showed a high inter-individual variability in the relationship resembling a sigmoid correlation. Different mechanisms besides the sodium-channel blockage as the main mode of action of LTG are discussed to explain the diversity of individual dose-response relationships. Provided that the RMT elevation reflects the antiepileptic potential of LTG, TMS may be developed as a tool to monitor interindividual response of epilepsy patients to LTG treatment as well as to explore efficacy of other antiepileptic drugs with similar mode of action.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Modulation of moving phosphene thresholds by transcranial direct current stimulation of V1 in human.", "keywords": [], "issue": "13", "pmid": "14527543", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Kincses, TZ", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Small moving sensations, so-called moving phosphenes are perceived, when V5, a visual area important for visual motion analysis, is stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

In this study we tested the involvement of V1 in the perception of moving phosphenes by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to this area. tDCS is a non-invasive stimulation technique known to modulate cortical excitability in a polarity-specific manner. Moving and stationary phosphene thresholds (PT) were measured by TMS before, immediately after and 10, 20 and 30 min after the end of 10 min cathodal and anodal tDCS in nine healthy subjects. Reduced PTs were detected immediately and 10 min after the end of anodal tDCS while cathodal stimulation resulted in an opposite effect. Our results show that the excitability shifts induced by V1 stimulation can modulate moving phosphene perception. tDCS elicits transient, but yet reversible effects, thus presenting a promising tool for neuroplasticity research.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Contribution of the ipsilateral motor cortex to recovery after chronic stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "14520658", "authors": ["Werhahn, KJ", "Conforto, AB", "Kadom, N", "Hallett, M", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "It has been proposed that the intact (ipsilateral) motor cortex play a significant role mediating recovery of motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients, but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Here, we evaluated the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on motor performance of the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients and healthy controls. We hypothesized that, if activity in the intact hemisphere contributes to functional recovery, TMS should result in abnormal motor behavior in the paretic hand. We found that stimulation of the intact hemisphere resulted in delayed simple reaction times (RTs) in the contralateral healthy but not in the ipsilateral paretic hand, whereas stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere led to a marked delay in RT in the contralateral paretic hand but not in the ipsilateral healthy hand. RT delays in the paretic hand correlated well with functional recovery. Finger tapping in the paretic hand was affected by TMS of the lesioned but not the intact hemisphere. These results are consistent with the idea that recovered motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients relies predominantly on reorganized activity within motor areas of the affected hemisphere.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "T2 hyperintensity along the cortico-spinal tract in cirrhosis relates to functional abnormalities.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "14512890", "authors": ["C\u00f3rdoba, J", "Raguer, N", "Flavi\u00e0, M", "Vargas, V", "Jacas, C", "Alonso, J", "Rovira, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance has shown T2 hyperintensity along the cortico-spinal tract in the brain of cirrhotic patients. This abnormality, which is reversible after liver transplantation, appears to correspond to mild edema. Because astrocytic edema present in hepatic encephalopathy may be responsible for neuronal dysfunction, we studied whether T2 hyperintensity along the cortico-spinal tract may relate to functional abnormalities. Twenty patients with cirrhosis underwent neuropsychologic tests, neurophysiologic study of the cortico-spinal tract with transcranial magnetic stimulation, and (1)H-magnetic resonance. The study was repeated 6 months after liver transplantation (n = 15) and was compared with a control group of healthy subjects (n = 11). Cirrhotic patients exhibited increased T2 signal and several functional abnormalities along the cortico-spinal tract (increased central motor conduction time, increased motor cortical threshold, and decreased motor-evoked potential amplitude). Functional abnormalities reversed after liver transplantation and were associated with normalization of T2 cortico-spinal hyperintensity and with improvement of minimal hepatic encephalopathy. In conclusion, T2 hyperintensity along the cortico-spinal tract in cirrhosis relates to functional abnormalities that are reversible after liver transplantation. These findings suggest that mild cerebral edema along the cortico-spinal pathway may cause neuronal dysfunction. These results support the participation of astrocytic edema in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "The role of prefrontal cortex in verbal episodic memory: rTMS evidence.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "14511538", "authors": ["Sandrini, M", "Cappa, SF", "Rossi, S", "Rossini, PM", "Miniussi, C"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Long-term, episodic memory processing is supposed to involve the prefrontal cortex asymmetrically.

Consistently with our previous findings using pictures, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had a significant impact on episodic memory. The performance was significantly disrupted when rTMS was applied to the left or right DLPFC during encoding, and to the right DLPFC in retrieval, but only for unrelated word pairs.

Here we employed this protocol of stimulation to assess associative plasticity of the primary motor hand area in 10 patients with writer's cramp and 10 age-matched controls. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from right APB muscle and right first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle. Resting and active motor threshold, mean MEP amplitude at rest, short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) at an interstimulus interval of 2 ms and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) were assessed immediately before and after associative stimulation. In both groups, associative stimulation led to an increase in resting MEP amplitudes which was more pronounced in the right APB muscle. Compared with healthy controls, stimulation-induced facilitation of MEP amplitudes was stronger in patients with writer's cramp. In addition, only patients showed a slight decrease of resting and active motor thresholds after conditioning stimulation. In both groups, associative stimulation induced a prolongation of CSP in the APB and FDI muscles, which was significant only in the APB muscle in healthy controls. Associative stimulation had no effects on SICI in patients and healthy controls. Taken together, in patients with writer's cramp, the motor system exhibited an abnormal increase in corticospinal excitability and an attenuated reinforcement of intracortical inhibitory circuits that generate the CSP in response to associative stimulation. This altered pattern of sensorimotor plasticity may favour maladaptive plasticity during repetitive skilled hand movements and, thus, may be of relevance for the pathophysiology of writer's cramp and other task-specific dystonias.", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Evidence of widespread impairment of motor cortical inhibition in focal dystonia: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in patients with blepharospasm and cervical dystonia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14509652", "authors": ["Cakmur, R", "Donmez, B", "Uzunel, F", "Aydin, H", "Kesken, S"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Advances in neurology", "abstract": "", "pages": "218-25"}, {"volume": "126", "title": "Abnormal associative plasticity of the human motor cortex in writer's cramp.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 12", "pmid": "14506068", "authors": ["Quartarone, A", "Bagnato, S", "Rizzo, V", "Siebner, HR", "Dattola, V", "Scalfari, A", "Morgante, F", "Battaglia, F", "Romano, M", "Girlanda, P"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "", "pages": "218-25"}]
