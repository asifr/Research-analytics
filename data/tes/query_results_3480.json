Systematic electrophysiological investigations of the peripheral and central nervous systems, particularly of cortico-spinal tract function, however, are not available. We studied peripheral and central nervous system involvement in 28 patients with histologically and biochemically proven mitochondrial CPEO by motor and sensory nerve conduction tests, by somatosensory, auditory and visual evoked potentials and, for the first time, by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nervous system involvement could be demonstrated in 24 patients, affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems in 18 and 10 patients, respectively. Evidence of cortico-spinal tract involvement was found in 4 patients, which was clinically expected in only 2. Therefore, dysfunction of the cortico-spinal tract in mitochondrial CPEO may occur more frequently than so far assumed. Generally, electrophysiological tests serve as valuable supplements to clinical examination in patients with mitochondrial CPEO and may be especially helpful in therapeutic studies, i.e., coenzyme Q administration.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "170", "title": "Vibration-induced presynaptic inhibition of the soleus H reflex is temporarily reduced by cortical magnetic stimulation in human subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8041494", "authors": ["Valls-Sole, J", "Alvarez, R", "Tolosa, ES"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "We have examined the effects of a transcranial magnetic stimulus (TMS) on the H reflex of the soleus muscle during vibration-induced presynaptic inhibition of the reflex, in seven normal volunteers. Without vibration, the H reflex was facilitated at interstimulus time intervals of > or = 5 ms after TMS. With vibration, the H reflex was markedly reduced or completely inhibited in control trials, but facilitation by TMS was noticed at intervals as short as -2.5 ms. These findings indicate an effect of TMS on the spinal interneurons mediating presynaptic vibratory inhibition of the H reflex.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "263", "title": "Modulation of cortical motor output maps during development of implicit and explicit knowledge.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5151", "pmid": "8122113", "authors": ["Pascual-Leone, A", "Grafman, J", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "The excitability of the human motor cortex during the development of implicit and declarative knowledge of a motor task was examined. During a serial reaction time test, subjects developed implicit knowledge of the test sequence, which was reflected by diminishing response times. Motor cortical mapping with transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed that the cortical output maps to the muscles involved in the task became progressively larger until explicit knowledge was achieved, after which they returned to their baseline topography. These results illustrate the rapid functional plasticity of cortical outputs associated with learning and with the transfer of knowledge from an implicit to explicit state.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Electromyographic silent period after transcranial brain stimulation in Huntington's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8079176", "authors": ["Priori, A", "Berardelli, A", "Inghilleri, M", "Polidori, L", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The silent period evoked by transcranial (TCS) and nerve stimulation was studied in the hand muscles in 13 patients with Huntington's disease and in 11 normal subjects. The duration of the silent period after TCS was longer in patients and correlated significantly with the severity of chorea; in contrast, the duration of the silent period after nerve stimulation was similar in patients and controls. The prolongation of the cortical silent period suggests that the duration of the silent period is a functional correlate reflecting basal ganglia influence over the motor cortex.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "On the cause of tendon areflexia in the Holmes-Adie syndrome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8196679", "authors": ["Pavesi, G", "Macaluso, GM", "Medici, D", "Ventura, P", "Lusvardi, M", "Gemignani, F", "Mancia, D"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "A case of Holmes-Adie syndrome was studied clinically and electrophysiologically.

The main electrophysiological finding was a marked increase of the central conduction time after stimulation of peroneal and tibial nerves. Motor evoked potentials in soleus muscle after transcranial magnetic stimulation showed normal threshold and latencies. We suggest that tendon areflexia could be a consequence of a dysfunction of somatosensory large diameter afferent fibres at the spinal level.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Electrophysiological assessment of central and peripheral motor routes to the lingual muscles.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "8187677", "authors": ["Muellbacher, W", "Mathis, J", "Hess, CW"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of the lingual muscles were recorded by especially devised bipolar surface electrodes placed on the tongue. Distinct responses were evoked in the tongue muscles by peripheral electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve medial to the angle of the jaw and by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. With cortical stimulation during voluntary activation of the tongue muscles it proved easy to obtain responses with the characteristics of centrally evoked responses allowing reliable measurements of latencies and amplitudes. By contrast, responses from magnetic stimulation of the intracranial segment of the hypoglossal nerve were more difficult to obtain and the reproducibility was often not satisfactory. In a group of 20 healthy subjects the average distal motor latency of both sides from peripheral stimulation was 2.4 ms and the corresponding amplitude was 9.3 mV on the left and 8.6 mV on the right side (range 5.1-16.0 mV). Cortical stimulation gave responses with an average onset latency of 8.6 ms and 8.8 ms and an average amplitude of 1.8 mV and 2.6 mV on the left and right sides of the tongue respectively (range 0.7-5.6 mV). From this mean conduction times of 6.2 ms on the left and 6.4 ms on the right side (SD 1.0 ms) between cortex and mandibular angle and relative amplitudes from cortical stimulation as compared with the peripheral CMAP of 29% on the left and 21% on the right side (range 7%-66%) were calculated. In 16 patients it was possible to differentiate between a central (supranuclear) and a peripheral (intranuclear) site for the lesions of the motors routes to the lingual muscles and to show subclinical lesions in some cases. With a recording arrangement allowing selective unilateral recording of muscle activity from both sides of the tongue the assumed bihemispheric motor representation of the lingual muscles was confirmed.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Central motor conduction time to upper and lower limbs in cervical cord lesions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "8158177", "authors": ["Brunh\u00f6lzl, C", "Claus, D"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Archives of neurology", "abstract": "Diagnostic value of central motor conduction time (CMCT) to upper and lower limbs in cervical cord lesions was investigated.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy: clinical and radiological correlations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1892367", "authors": ["Tavy, DL", "Wagner, GL", "Keunen, RW", "Wattendorff, AR", "Hekster, RE", "Franssen, H"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "A series of patients underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "The cortical silent period and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "6089647", "authors": ["Prout, AJ", "Eisen, AA"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Patients hospitalized in our department were investigated.", "pages": "304-12"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Conduction pathways and generators of magnetic evoked spinal cord potentials: a study in monkeys.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "3351531", "authors": ["Kitagawa, H", "M\u00f8ller, AR"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Forty-seven consecutive patients with cervical spinal lesions (31 patients with myelopathy due to cervical spondylosis, eight with syringomyelia, eight with tumors) were tested.", "pages": "304-12"}]
