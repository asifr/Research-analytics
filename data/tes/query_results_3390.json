Ipsilateral TMS preceded the contralateral magnetic or electrical cortex stimulation by 0-50 ms. In all subjects, the duration of the silent period was decreased in interstimulus intervals of 20-30 ms when using magnetic ipsi- and contralateral stimuli. No change in the silent period was seen with ipsilateral magnetic and contralateral electrical stimulations. Decreases of motor evoked potential amplitudes were an inconsistent phenomenon. The results indicate that ipsilateral TMS in activate inhibitory cortical interneurons, probably via transcallosal pathways.

Supplement", "abstract": "Changes of excitability in the neuraxis were studied in 11 healthy subjects with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimuli of the motor cortex at frequencies of 1-10 Hz. Following trains of four stimuli, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were obtained from the flexor carpi radialis muscle. At an interstimulation interval (ISI) of 100-180 ms. the amplitudes of the CMAPs evoked by stimuli II and IV were inhibited as compared with the amplitude of the CMAPs evoked by the first stimulus. In contrast, the amplitude of the CMAPs evoked by stimulus III was almost unchanged. Changes in excitability depended on the stimulation intensity. Thus, it was demonstrated that the amplitude of the CMAPs evoked by stimulus III was reduced at low stimulation intensities (100 and 110% of threshold intensity) but normalized at higher stimulation intensities (120 and 130% of threshold intensity). Results of H-reflex studies indicated that excitability changes at the segmental level are not necessarily involved in the inhibition of the CMAPs evoked by stimuli II and IV at an ISI of 100 ms. It is proposed that long acting neurotransmitter modulation can explain part of the inhibition during repetitive magnetic stimulation, and that recruitment of different neurons, due to electric field differences, explains the dependence of excitability on stimulation intensity.", "pages": "184-92"}, {"volume": "103", "title": "Changes of inhibitory interneurons during transcallosal stimulations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8-9", "pmid": "9013385", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Tegenthoff, M", "Malin, JP"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Fourteen cats were subjected to a moderate (100 gm-cm; n = 7) or a severe (600 gm-cm; n = 7) spinal cord injury at the C4-C5 level using a weight drop technique.

After the moderate injury (n = 7), 83% of the animals (6/7) maintained the SSEPs and 100% (7/7) maintained the MEPs. Postoperatively, only one animal who lost the SSEPs post-injury became tetraplegic. The remainder were neurologically intact. In the severely injured animals (n = 7), 5/7 of animals lost SSEPs and subsequently became tetraplegic. The MEPS were maintained in 3/5 (60%) of these tetraplegic animals. Two of seven animals (40%) in this group did not lose SSEPs or MEPs and recovered with no clinical deficit. Our data show a good correlation between the presence of SSEPs and functional recovery in the injured groups.

The double shock technique was adopted here because it offers a means for highlighting abnormal inhibitory mechanisms. From previous experiments performed on healthy subjects, it is known that a magnetic conditioning stimulus, of subthreshold intensity, suppresses the MEP in response to a subsequent suprathreshold stimulus delivered after 1-4 msec. JME patients were selected as a potential contrast with other forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, because they complain of myoclonic jerks without loss of consciousness, indicating with certainty a dysfunction of the motor cortex. Two patients with sporadic grand mal and one non-epileptic patient were also investigated. Paired stimulation was produced by a Bi-stim (Magstim) stimulator, with a figure-of-8 coil placed over the hand area of the motor cortex, and a set of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging from 1 to 6 msec was analyzed. In JME patients there were two indications of abnormality with respect to normal subjects and to the other epileptic patients: (1) the absence of MEP suppression to paired stimulation; (2) a progressive amplitude increase of MEPs to the test stimulus alone. In the two patients with the other form of epilepsy the pattern of inhibition was broadly preserved, even though there was some difference from the normal profile. The results suggest that the loss of MEP inhibition can be regarded as a marker of JME.", "pages": "184-92"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Neurophysiological evidence of spared upper motor neurons after spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8848322", "authors": ["Haghighi, SS", "York, DH", "Spollen, L", "Oro, JJ", "Perez-Espejo, MA"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Paraplegia", "abstract": "We studied a 13-year-old girl with unilateral extensive cortical dysplasia who had mild hemiparesis with mirror movement and no sensory deficit.

The scalp positions where the MEP amplitudes were highest were at the same site in the unaffected hemisphere for both APBs. TMS to the affected heimsphere showed no MEP for either APB. These data indicated that the APB response of the paretic side originated from the same motor cortex as for the contralateral APB, probably due to axonal sprouting. In the study of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials, the cortical representation point of the paretic hand sensation was in the ipsilateral unaffected hemisphere; this point was located anterior to the cortical representation point of the contralateral hand sensation.

Definition of excitability and inhibitory threshold represents clinically useful indicator. In order to reduce variability of the thresholds, it is important to notice mental activity, posture, type of magnetic stimulator, involuntary movement, muscle tonus and age. Excitability threshold was elevated in patients with stroke and reduced in patients with epilepsy. Enhancement of motor excitability by subthreshold magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex prior to voluntary movement was observed during simple reaction time measurement. Reaction time can be divided into a period of resting condition and the premotion facilitatory effect in the 50 approximately 60 ms after the target stimuli. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the prolongation of reaction time is due to a prolongation of a period of premotion facilitatory effect. Jerk-locked MEP is a useful technique to evaluate a change of motor excitability after voluntary or involuntary movement. To record jerk-locked MEP, magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex is delivered at varying intervals after the onset of the EMG activity.

The amplitude of muscle response was unstable in magnitude, nevertheless, it did not show any significant difference between the two sides. The latency of response for ipsilateral and contralateral muscles was similar, which suggests simultaneous activation of motor pathways servicing forelimb muscles. Lesioning or ablation of the motor cortex and decerebration at mid-colliculi level did not abolish the evoked responses elicited at high intensity magnetic stimulation. Stereotactic electrical stimulation of the vestibular nuclei complex was performed, and satisfactory ipsilateral motor responses were obtained. Subsequently, a stereotactic radiofrequency lesion was made at the vestibular nuclei complex, with morphological confirmation. After this lesion, the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were significantly diminished in amplitude. This finding strongly suggests that the generator of the MEPs resides in the brainstem, mainly at the vestibular nuclei complex.", "pages": "184-92"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "[Analysis of cortical excitation and inhibition using transcranial magnetic stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "8797502", "authors": ["Uozumi, T"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Rinsh\u014d shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "abstract": "", "pages": "184-92"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Origin of muscle action potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in cats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "8752448", "authors": ["Haghighi, SS", "P\u00e9rez-Espejo, MA", "Oro, JJ", "Adelstein, EH", "Choi, HJ"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "", "pages": "184-92"}]
