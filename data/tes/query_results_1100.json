Here, we investigated, for the first time in a 'proof of principle' study, the behavioural effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on visuospatial attention in both healthy controls and stroke patients suffering from left visuospatial neglect. We applied anodal, cathoP:dal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (57 microA/cm(2), 10 min) to the left or right posterior parietal cortex. Using a visual detection task in a group of right-handed healthy individuals (n = 20), we observed that transcranial direct current stimulation enhanced or impaired performance depending on stimulation parameters (i.e. current polarity) and stimulated hemisphere. These results are in good accordance with classic models of reciprocal interhemispheric competition ('rivalry'). In a second experiment, we investigated the potential of transcranial direct current stimulation to ameliorate left visuospatial neglect (n = 10). Interestingly, both the inhibitory effect of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the unlesioned posterior parietal cortex and the facilitatory effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the lesioned posterior parietal cortex reduced symptoms of visuospatial neglect. Taken together, our findings suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the posterior parietal cortex can be used to modulate visuospatial processing and that this effect is exerted by influencing interhemispheric reciprocal networks. These novel findings also suggest that a transcranial direct current stimulation-induced modulation of interhemispheric parietal balance may be used clinically to ameliorate visuospatial attention deficits in neglect patients.", "pages": "3011-20"}, {"volume": "163", "title": "Increased cortical plasticity in the elderly: changes in the somatosensory cortex after paired associative stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19524024", "authors": ["Pellicciari, MC", "Miniussi, C", "Rossini, PM", "De Gennaro, L"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "A fundamental feature of the human cortex is the capability to express plastic changes that seem to be present even during physiological aging. The paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol is a paradigm capable of inducing neuroplastic changes, possibly by mechanisms related to spike timing-dependent associative neuronal activity, and represents a suitable tool for investigating age-dependent neuroplastic modulations of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). To examine age dependency of S1 plasticity, the amplitude changes of median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) before and after PAS intervention were investigated in young and elderly subjects. The main finding of our study is that low-frequency medial nerve stimulation paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral cortex enhances S1 excitability. Moreover, the S1 long term potentiation-like plasticity changes as a function of aging, with a significant increase of N20-P25 complex in the elderly compared to young subjects. These results are congruent with the hypothesis that some elderly subjects retain a high level of plasticity in specific neuronal circuits. Such plasticity could represent a compensatory mechanism, in terms of functional reserve of somatosensory cortex, used by the aging brain to counterbalance the cortical degeneration associated with aging.", "pages": "3011-20"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Facilitation of corticospinal excitability in the tibialis anterior muscle during robot-assisted passive stepping in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19523098", "authors": ["Kamibayashi, K", "Nakajima, T", "Takahashi, M", "Akai, M", "Nakazawa, K"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Although phasic modulation of the corticospinal tract excitability to the lower limb muscles has been observed during normal walking, it is unclear to what extent afferent information induced by walking is related to the modulation. The purpose of this study was to test the corticospinal excitability to the lower limb muscles by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex while 13 healthy subjects passively stepped in a robotic driven-gait orthosis. Specifically, to investigate the effect of load-related afferent inputs on the corticospinal excitability during passive stepping, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to the stimulation were compared between two passive stepping conditions: 40% body weight unloading on a treadmill (ground stepping) and 100% body weight unloading in the air (air stepping). In the rectus femoris, biceps femoris and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, electromyographic activity was not observed throughout the step cycle in either stepping condition. However, the TMS-evoked MEPs of the TA muscle at the early- and late-swing phases as well as at the early-stance phase during ground stepping were significantly larger than those observed during air stepping. The modulation pattern of the transcranial electrical stimulation-evoked MEPs was similar to that of the TMS-evoked MEPs. These results suggest that corticospinal excitability to the TA is facilitated by load-related afferent inputs. Thus, these results might be consistent with the notion that load-related afferent inputs play a significant role during locomotor training for gait disorders.", "pages": "3011-20"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Recovery of function in humans: cortical stimulation and pharmacological treatments after stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19520165", "authors": ["Floel, A", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "abstract": "In this contribution, we first provide an overview of general principles of reorganisation in the human brain, and point out possible biomarkers of recovery.

During a microvascular decompression operation to treat hemilingual spasm, transcranial stimulation elicited a delayed electromyographic (EMG) response from the tongue. This late volley of EMG activity occurred with a latency of approximately 40 ms, lasted approximately 50 ms, and disappeared when the offending vessel was displaced away from the exit zone of the hypoglossal nerve root along medulla oblongata. This late tongue EMG response resembles those found in facial muscles of the patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS). In HFS, electrical stimulation of a branch of facial nerve may elicit an EMG response with a latency of approximately 10 ms in muscles innervated by another branch of the nerve, followed by a variable volley of EMG activity that may last 100 ms or longer. This abnormal response, known as the lateral spread response, is a characteristic sign for hemifacial spasm that disappears after the offending vessel is moved off the facial nerve root. The results of the present study indicate that the EMG signs of hemilingual spasm are similar to those of HFS and that the tongue spasms are most likely caused by hyperactivity of the hypoglossal motonucleus. Based on the authors' knowledge, the above detailed electrophysiological findings related to hemilingual spasm have not been previously reported in the literature.", "pages": "3011-20"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Dopamine modulates cholinergic cortical excitability in Alzheimer's disease patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "19516251", "authors": ["Martorana, A", "Mori, F", "Esposito, Z", "Kusayanagi, H", "Monteleone, F", "Codec\u00e0, C", "Sancesario, G", "Bernardi, G", "Koch, G"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients dysfunction of cholinergic neurons is considered a typical hallmark, leading to a rationale for the pharmacological treatment in use based on drugs that enhance acetylcholine neurotransmission. However, besides altered acetylcholine transmission, other neurotransmitter systems are involved in cognitive dysfunction leading to dementia. Among others, dopamine seems to be particularly involved in the regulation of cognitive processes, also having functional relationship with acetylcholine. To test whether cholinergic dysfunction can be modified by dopamine, we used short latency afferent inhibition (SLAI) as a neurophysiological tool. First, we tested the function of the cholinergic system in AD patients and in healthy subjects. Then, we tested whether a single L-dopa challenge was able to interfere with this system in both groups. We observed that SLAI was reduced in AD patients, and preserved in normal subjects. L-dopa administration was able to restore SLAI modification only in AD, having no effect in healthy subjects. We conclude that dopamine can modify SLAI in AD, thus confirming the relationship between acetylcholine and dopamine systems. Moreover, it is suggested that together with cholinergic, dopaminergic system alteration is likely to occur in AD, also. These alterations might be responsible, at least in part, for the progressive cognitive decline observed in AD patients.", "pages": "3011-20"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Central fatigue after cycling evaluated using peripheral magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "19516154", "authors": ["Kremenic, IJ", "Glace, BW", "Ben-Avi, SS", "Nicholas, SJ", "McHugh, MP"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Medicine and science in sports and exercise", "abstract": "Central and peripheral mechanisms contribute to fatigue during exercise.
