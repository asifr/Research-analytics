We used TMS stimulus intensities of 200, 150, 120, and 100% of motor evoked potential (MEP) threshold before and after (86 +/- 25 days) PAL. PAL increased CSSP duration at stimulus intensities of 200% of MEP threshold in the hand contralateral to the stereotactic lesion. In a subset of five patients able to remain at rest during pre-PAL testing sessions, PAL decreased the resting MEP/M-wave area ratio in the hand contralateral to the lesion at a stimulus intensity of 120% of MEP threshold. PAL did not significantly modify the effects of TMS in the hand ipsilateral to the globus pallidus lesion. The results suggest that PAL improves the function of cortical motor inhibitory circuits in Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "1278-83"}, {"volume": "151", "title": "Spatial distribution of corticospinal potentials following transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation in human spinal cord.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11865162", "authors": ["Kaneko, K", "Kawai, S", "Taguchi, T", "Fuchigami, Y", "Morita, H", "Ofuji, A", "Yonemura, H"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "To investigate the spatial distribution of the human corticospinal tract in the spinal cord, evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCPs) following transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation were recorded simultaneously from both the anterior and posterior epidural space in five anesthetized patients. One ESCP component following transcranial electrical stimulation (D-wave) and at least two ESCP components (initially D-wave and later I-wave) following transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded in all subjects. The negative peak latency of all the potentials recorded from the posterior epidural space was the same as that recorded anteriorly. The amplitude ratio of the ESCP following electrical stimulation (posterior/anterior) was 1.10+/-0.12, while that of ESCPs following magnetic stimulation was 1.08+/-0.12 (N1) and 1.15+/-0.16 (N2).
