Moreover, transcranial magnetic stimulation has effects on neurochemical and synaptic processes in neurons. Due to its easy use and relatively fair side effects, nowadays, transcranial magnetic stimulation is widely used in neurosciences and medicine. The main areas of transcranial magnetic stimulation application are: 1) the investigation of cortical and spinal excitability, 2) the investigation of neuronal plasticity, 3) the investigation of neuronal connectivity, 4) functional mapping, and 5) the treatment of some neurological and psychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation alone or in combination with other noninvasive neuroimaging (PET--positron emission topography, MRI--magnetic resonance imaging) and neurofunctional (EEG--electroencephalography, ERP--event-related potentials, fMRI--functional magnetic resonance imaging) methods allows conducting research on brain functions. Thus, transcranial magnetic stimulation is suitable as a diagnostic tool in neurologic and neuropsychiatric brain research.", "pages": "798-804"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Abnormal plasticity of the sensorimotor cortex to slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with writer's cramp.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17089385", "authors": ["B\u00e4umer, T", "Demiralay, C", "Hidding, U", "Bikmullina, R", "Helmich, RC", "Wunderlich, S", "Rothwell, J", "Liepert, J", "Siebner, HR", "M\u00fcnchau, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrated functional abnormalities in the somatosensory system, including a distorted functional organization of the somatosensory cortex (S1) in patients with writer's cramp. We tested the hypothesis that these functional alterations render S1 of these patients more susceptible to the \"inhibitory\" effects of subthreshold 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) given to S1. Seven patients with writer's cramp and eight healthy subjects were studied. Patients also received rTMS to the motor cortex hand area (M1). As an outcome measure, short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) was tested. SAI was studied in the relaxed first dorsal interosseous muscle using conditioning electrical stimulation of the index finger and TMS pulses over the contralateral M1. Baseline SAI did not differ between groups. S1 but not M1 rTMS reduced SAI in patients. rTMS had no effects on SAI in healthy subjects. Because SAI is mediated predominantly at a cortical level in the sensorimotor cortex, we conclude that there is an abnormal responsiveness of this area to 1 Hz rTMS in writer's cramp, which may represent a trait toward maladaptive plasticity in the sensorimotor system in these patients.", "pages": "798-804"}, {"volume": "444", "title": "Boosting slow oscillations during sleep potentiates memory.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7119", "pmid": "17086200", "authors": ["Marshall, L", "Helgad\u00f3ttir, H", "M\u00f6lle, M", "Born, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Nature", "abstract": "There is compelling evidence that sleep contributes to the long-term consolidation of new memories. This function of sleep has been linked to slow (<1 Hz) potential oscillations, which predominantly arise from the prefrontal neocortex and characterize slow wave sleep. However, oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks, which links the membrane and synaptic processes of these neurons in time. Whether brain potentials and their extracellular equivalent have any physiological meaning per se is unclear, but can easily be investigated by inducing the extracellular oscillating potential fields of interest. Here we show that inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans. The slowly oscillating potential stimulation induced an immediate increase in slow wave sleep, endogenous cortical slow oscillations and slow spindle activity in the frontal cortex. Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz--another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep--decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged. Our findings indicate that endogenous slow potential oscillations have a causal role in the sleep-associated consolidation of memory, and that this role is enhanced by field effects in cortical extracellular space.", "pages": "798-804"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Effect of corpus callosum damage on ipsilateral motor activation in patients with multiple sclerosis: a functional and anatomical study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "17086196", "authors": ["Lenzi, D", "Conte, A", "Mainero, C", "Frasca, V", "Fubelli, F", "Totaro, P", "Caramia, F", "Inghilleri, M", "Pozzilli, C", "Pantano, P"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown increased activation of ipsilateral motor areas during hand movement in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We hypothesized that these changes could be due to disruption of transcallosal inhibitory pathways. We studied 18 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired and lesion load (LL) measured. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to estimate fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the body of the corpus callosum (CC). fMRI was obtained during a right-hand motor task. Patients were studied to evaluate transcallosal inhibition (TCI, latency and duration) and central conduction time (CCT). Eighteen normal subjects were studied with the same techniques. Patients showed increased MD (P < 0.0005) and reduced FA (P < 0.0005) in the body of the CC. Mean latency and duration of TCI were altered in 12 patients and absent in the others. Between-group analysis showed greater activation in patients in bilateral premotor, primary motor (M1), and middle cingulate cortices and in the ipsilateral supplementary motor area, insula, and thalamus. A multivariate analysis between activation patterns, structural MRI, and neurophysiological findings demonstrated positive correlations between T1-LL, MD in the body of CC, and activation of the ipsilateral motor cortex (iM1) in patients. Duration of TCI was negatively correlated with activation in the iM1. Our data suggest that functional changes in iM1 in patients with MS during a motor task partially represents a consequence of loss of transcallosal inhibitory fibers.", "pages": "798-804"}, {"volume": "251", "title": "The cortico-diaphragmatic pathway involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: neurophysiological, respiratory and clinical considerations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "17080438", "authors": ["Miscio, G", "Gukov, B", "Pisano, F", "Mazzini, L", "Baudo, S", "Salvadori, A", "Mauro, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Cortico-diaphragmatic pathway was investigated by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in 14 patients affected by definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without clinical signs of respiratory impairment.

Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume at the first and second peak expiratory flow, sniff effort from FRC level (SNIP), maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure at mouth (MIP/MEP), maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimx) were considered. TMS was performed, recording by surface electrodes from hemidiaphragm, bilaterally. Latency of cortical and spinal motor-evoked potentials (Cx-MEP/Sp-MEP) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) were measured. None of the patients showed altered spirometry and gas levels. Seven patients showed decreased Pdimx and eight of MEP values. Four patients showed a delayed Sp-MEP. In one patient the Cx-MEP was abolished while the mean values of both Cx-MEP and CMCT were significantly increased (19.2+/-4.1 ms, P<0.0001; 10.8+/-4.8 ms, P<0.0001).

We have used the unique model provided by this group of patients to investigate the hypothesis that abnormalities in brain plasticity underlie the pathophysiology of primary dystonia. We recruited 8 DYT1 gene carriers with dystonia, 6 DYT1 gene carriers without dystonia, 6 patients with sporadic primary dystonia (torticollis), and 10 healthy control subjects. Groups were age-matched. We compared the effect in these groups of subjects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the motor cortex, by assessing changes in corticospinal excitability following rTMS. rTMS was given in the form of theta burst stimulation (TBS) using the inhibitory protocol \"cTBS\" (total of 300 pulses in 50-Hz bursts given every 5Hz). DYT1 gene carriers with dystonia and subjects with torticollis had a significantly prolonged response to rTMS in comparison with healthy subjects. In contrast, DYT1 gene carriers without dystonia had no significant response to rTMS. These data demonstrate an excessive response to an experimental \"plasticity probing protocol\" in subjects with dystonia, but a lack of response in genetically susceptible individuals who have not developed dystonia. These preliminary data suggest that the propensity to undergo plastic change may affect the development of symptoms in genetically susceptible individuals and that this may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of primary dystonia in general.", "pages": "798-804"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Intravital microscopy on a closed cranial window in mice: a model to study trigeminovascular mechanisms involved in migraine.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "17078060", "authors": ["Gupta, S", "Akerman, S", "van den Maagdenberg, AM", "Saxena, PR", "Goadsby, PJ", "van den Brink, AM"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache", "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to develop a mouse model to study trigeminovascular mechanisms using intravital microscopy on a closed cranial window. In addition, we studied exogenous and endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-mediated vasodilation in dural arteries. Arteries in C57BL/6Jico mice were constricted with endothelin-1, which reduced the baseline diameter by 65-75%. Subsequently, vasodilation was induced by alpha-CGRP, capsaicin or transcranial electrical stimulation of perivascular trigeminal nerves in the absence or presence of different concentrations of BIBN4096BS or sumatriptan. Both alpha-CGRP and capsaicin induced vasodilation in preconstricted arteries. Transcranial electrical stimulation also induced current-dependent relaxation of dural arteries with 100 microA producing maximal dilation in the control group. BIBN4096BS blocked the responses evoked by alpha-CGRP and capsaicin, as well as electrical stimulation, whereas sumatriptan attenuated only vasodilation induced by electrical stimulation. This model is likely to prove useful in dissecting elements of the trigeminovascular system and for exploring pathophysiological aspects of migraine, especially in future studies using transgenic mice with mutations relevant to those observed in patients with migraine.", "pages": "798-804"}, {"volume": "178", "title": "Visual evoked potentials modulation during direct current cortical polarization.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17059436", "authors": ["Accornero, N", "Li Voti, P", "La Riccia, M", "Gregori, B"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We studied changes in visual evoked potentials (VEPs) during and after anodal and cathodal tDCS by applying, in healthy volunteers, 1 mA polarization through surface electrodes placed over the occipital scalp (polarizing) and over the anterior or posterior neck-base (reference). We compared tDCS applied at two durations, 3 and 10 min and both polarities. We assessed VEP-P100 latencies and amplitudes in response to pattern-reversal checkerboard stimuli before, during, and after polarization. Anodal polarization reduced VEP-P100 amplitude whereas cathodal polarization significantly increased amplitude but both polarities left latency statistically unchanged. These changes persisted for some minutes after polarization ended depending on the duration of tDCS and on the contrast level of visual stimuli. tDCS-induced changes in VEPs seem to depend on the duration of polarization and type of visual stimuli used. The effects induced on visual cortical neurones during polarization are more consistent than the aftereffects.

At a microscopic level, modulations of synaptic efficacy, unmasking of latent connections, phenotypic modifications and neurogenesis have been identified. At a macroscopic level, diaschisis, functional redundancies, sensory substitution and morphological changes have been described. In the second part, the behavioral consequences of such cerebral phenomena in physiology, namely the \"natural\" plasticity, are analyzed in humans. The review concludes on the therapeutic implications provided by a better understanding of these mechanisms of brain reshaping.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) does not easily elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in patients with a central nervous system dysfunction, even though a few methods, such as contraction of the target muscles and the Jendrassik maneuver (JM), are used in the attempt to facilitate them. In these two patients, we used a conditioning method (prior electrical stimulation over the cutaneous nerve of the left index finger) in order to facilitate MEPs, elicited by TMS, in the left tibialis anterior muscle. In patient 1, facilitation of MEPs was present at conditioning-test (C-T) intervals in the range 60-220 ms, with the maximal MEP recorded at C-T 160 ms; in patient 2, it occurred in the C-T interval range 110-140 ms, with the maximal MEP recorded at C-T 130 ms. By means of conditioning electrical stimulation, we can facilitate MEPs elicited by TMS in those subjects in whom MEPs are minimal or difficult to elicit even using the conventional JM or muscle contraction. The facilitation of MEPs by conditioning stimuli allowed us not only to assess central motor conduction time, but also to demonstrate the preserved continuity of the corticospinal tract in these two patients.", "pages": "798-804"}]
