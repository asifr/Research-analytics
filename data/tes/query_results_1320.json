For galvanic stimulation, surface electrodes were attached to the right and left mastoid and two further electrodes were fixed near to each shoulder blade. Thus, each pair of electrodes (mastoid to shoulder) facilitated unilateral stimulation of the ipsilateral vestibular labyrinth. Blood flow in the middle cerebral artery and the internal carotid artery in both hemispheres was measured by means of Doppler ultrasound. The transcranial Doppler ultrasound system was head-fixed and allowed continuous monitoring of the blood flow throughout the trials. Using a series of different stimulation modes (bilateral, unilateral left, unilateral right and sham), the changes in mean blood flow velocity were evaluated by comparing baseline blood flow under resting conditions to blood flow during stimulation. A total of 18 trials were performed with each of seven volunteer subjects. Galvanic labyrinth polarization elicited a clear sensation of pendular body movement in all subjects. Significant blood flow increase (P < 0.05) in both hemispheres was observed during bilateral stimulation. Of more interest is that unilateral stimulation also elicited a significant increase in flow in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres, demonstrating the existence of bilateral projections from each vestibular labyrinth. The combination of galvanic labyrinth polarization with transcranial Doppler ultrasound blood flow measurement provides a novel approach to the functional assessment of the vestibular system (deep cerebral structures and cortical areas). This novel technique provides a useful tool for clinical examinations.", "pages": "372-8"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the primary motor cortex interferes with motor learning by observing.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "18702578", "authors": ["Brown, LE", "Wilson, ET", "Gribble, PL"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Neural representations of novel motor skills can be acquired through visual observation. We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test the idea that this \"motor learning by observing\" is based on engagement of neural processes for learning in the primary motor cortex (M1). Human subjects who observed another person learning to reach in a novel force environment imposed by a robot arm performed better when later tested in the same environment than subjects who observed movements in a different environment. rTMS applied to M1 after observation reduced the beneficial effect of observing congruent forces, and eliminated the detrimental effect of observing incongruent forces. Stimulation of a control site in the frontal cortex had no effect on reaching. Our findings represent the first direct evidence that neural representations of motor skills in M1, a cortical region whose role has been firmly established for active motor learning, also underlie motor learning by observing.", "pages": "372-8"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Cortisol inhibits neuroplasticity induction in human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "33", "pmid": "18701691", "authors": ["Sale, MV", "Ridding, MC", "Nordstrom, MA"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "We investigated whether plasticity of human motor cortex (M1) is influenced by time of day, and whether changes in circulating levels of cortisol contribute to this effect. Neuroplasticity was induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS), involving electrical stimulation of left median nerve, paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the right M1 25 ms later (90 pairs at 0.05 Hz). Surface EMG was recorded from the left abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseous muscle. Cortisol levels were assessed from saliva. Time-of-day modulation of PAS effectiveness was assessed in 25 subjects who were tested twice, at 8:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. on separate days. In a second double-blind study, 17 subjects were tested with PAS at 8:00 P.M. on two occasions after administration of oral hydrocortisone (24 mg) or placebo. The motor-evoked potential (MEP) in resting APB increased significantly after PAS in the evening (when endogenous cortisol levels were low), but not in the morning. Oral hydrocortisone prevented facilitation of the APB MEP after PAS, and in the drug study, mean salivary cortisol levels were negatively associated with PAS effectiveness. The GABA(B)-mediated cortical silent period for APB was longer in the morning than in the evening, and was lengthened by PAS and oral hydrocortisone. We conclude that neuroplasticity in human M1 and GABA(B)-dependent intracortical inhibitory systems are influenced by time of day and modified by circulating levels of cortisol.", "pages": "372-8"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Brain mapping with transcranial magnetic stimulation using a refined correlation ratio and Kendall's tau.", "keywords": [], "issue": "25", "pmid": "18693298", "authors": ["Matth\u00e4us, L", "Trillenberg, P", "Fadini, T", "Finke, M", "Schweikard, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Statistics in medicine", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation provides a mean to stimulate the brain non-invasively and painlessly. The effect of the stimulation hereby depends on the stimulation coil used and on its placement. This paper presents a mapping algorithm based on the assumption of a monotonous functional relationship between the applied electric field strength at the representation point of a muscle and the evoked motor potential. We combine data from coil characteristics, coil placement, and stimulation outcome to calculate a likelihood map for the representation of stimulated muscles in the brain. Hereby, correlation ratio (CR) and Kendall's rank coefficient tau are used to find areas in the brain where there is most likely a functional or monotonous relationship between electric field strength applied to this area and the muscle response. First results show a good accordance of our method with mapping from functional magnetic resonance imaging. In our case, classical evaluation of CR with binning is impossible, because sample data sets are too small and data are continuous. We therefore introduce a refined CR formula based on a Parzen windowing of the X-data to solve the problem. In contrast to usual windowing approaches, which require numeric integration, it can be evaluated directly in O(n2) time. Hence, its advantage lies in fast evaluation while maintaining robust applicability to small sample sets. We suggest that the presented formula can generally be used in CR-related problems where sample size is small and data range is continuous.", "pages": "372-8"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Differential contributions of spinal and cortical motoneurons to input-output properties of human small hand muscle.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "18691450", "authors": ["Oishi, A", "Tobimatsu, S", "Ogata, K", "Taniwaki, T", "Kinukawa, N", "Toyoshiba, H", "Kira, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "It is not fully understood how the stimulus/response curves obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reflect the function of the cortico-motoneuronal (CM) and spinal motoneuronal (SM) systems in healthy subjects.

Pharmacotherapeutic approaches include: neuropeptides (agonists such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and antagonists such as corticotropin-releasing hormone), neurotrophic factors (especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and glutamatergic mechanisms (such as riluzole, ketamine, and antagonists of the NR-2B subunit of the glutamate receptor). Physiological interventions that would offer alternatives to electroconvulsive therapy include: repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation, especially at more intense stimulation parameters; magnetic stimulation therapy (seizures induced more focally by magnetic rather than electrical stimulation with resulting reduced meaning loss); vagal nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. However, these, as well as the panoply of existing treatments, require further intensive investigation to place each of them in the proper therapeutic sequence and combination for the individual patient, based on development of better clinical and biological predictors of response. Large clinical trial networks and development of systematic research in clinical practice settings, such as that featured by the National Cancer Institute for cancer chemotherapy, would greatly accelerate the progress in incorporating new, as well as existing, agents into the best treatment strategies.

Whereas the relevance of this mechanism for neuroplasticity in humans has been ascertained on the neurophysiological level, its functional relevance remains unclear so far. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the pre-performance cortical activity and excitability state on subsequent performance practicing a visuomotor paradigm. Excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) or the visual area MT/V5 was modulated by 10 min of anodal or cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy subjects before practice of a visuomotor tracking task. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased significantly in the early phase of practice after both anodal and cathodal stimulations over both cortical areas compared to the no-stimulation condition showing a behavioral improvement at the beginning of the practice process. Stimulation of a control cortical area did not result in significant difference with regard to the practice between cathodal, anodal and sham stimulation. However, the steepness of improvement between the different time-points was significantly increased only at the beginning of the task, and was reduced at the 5'-10' (V5) and 10'-15' (M1) time-window with regard to anodal stimulation, compared to the 'no-stimulation' condition. With regard to cathodal stimulation, the steepness of improvement was significantly lower at the 10'-15' time-window (M1) compared to the 'no-stimulation' condition. The results of our study underline the principal functional relevance of the BCM rule for the efficacy of visuomotor practice, but imply that also other mechanisms have to be taken into account.", "pages": "372-8"}]
