The mechanisms influencing stimulus-response curves elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and their operation site along the human neuraxis are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of CNS-active drugs with distinct mechanisms of action on S-R curves. Effects of each of these drugs on S-R curves would point to the involvement of specific mechanisms. Additionally, relative sensitivity of S-R curves compared with other measures of corticospinal excitability was studied.", "pages": "931-7"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Disinhibition of somatosensory and motor cortex in mitochondriopathy without myoclonus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11336909", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Haueisen, J", "Hegemann, S", "Weiller, C"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We studied the effects of lorazepam, which is a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors; lamotrigine, an inhibitor of voltage-gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels; and D-amphetamine, an indirect agonist of the dopaminergic-adrenergic system on S-R curves, motor thresholds (MT), and intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) with a double-pulse technique.

Less emphasis has been placed on the role of supraspinal pathways during passive movement, and on tasks involving the upper limb. In the present study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to subjects while undergoing passive flexion-extension movements of the contralateral wrist. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and abductor pollicus brevis (APB) muscles were recorded. Stimuli were delivered in eight phases of the movement cycle during three different frequencies of movement. Evidence of marked modulations in pathway excitability was found in the MEP amplitudes of the FCR muscle, with responses inhibited and facilitated from static values in the extension and flexion phases, respectively. The results indicated that at higher frequencies of movement there was greater modulation in pathway excitability. Paired-pulse TMS (sub-threshold conditioning) at short interstimulus intervals revealed modulations in the extent of inhibition in MEP amplitude at high movement frequencies. In the APB muscle, there was some evidence of phasic modulations of response amplitude, although the effects were less marked than those observed in FCR. It is speculated that these modulatory effects are mediated via Ia afferent pathways and arise as a consequence of the induced forearm muscle shortening and lengthening. Although the level at which this input influences the corticomotoneuronal pathway is difficult to discern, a contribution from cortical regions is suggested.", "pages": "931-7"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Impairment of motor cortex activation and deactivation in Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11275535", "authors": ["Chen, R", "Kumar, S", "Garg, RR", "Lang, AE"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study was designed to examine whether transcranial electrical motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring is safe, feasible, and valuable for brain tumor surgery.", "pages": "931-7"}]
