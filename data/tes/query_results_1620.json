A detailed account of TMS coil wiring geometry is shown to provide significant improvements in the accuracy of electric field (E-field) models. Modeling E-field dependence based on the TMS coil's wire width, height, shape and number of turns clearly improved the fit of calculated-to-measured E-fields near the coil body. Detailed E-field models were accurate up to the surface of the coil body (within 0.5% of measured) where simple models were often inadequate (up to 32% different from measured).", "pages": "2879-92"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Behavioral detection of electrical microstimulation in different cortical visual areas.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "17462895", "authors": ["Murphey, DK", "Maunsell, JH"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "The extent to which areas in the visual cerebral cortex differ in their ability to support perceptions has been the subject of considerable speculation. Experiments examining the activity of individual neurons have suggested that activity in later stages of the visual cortex is more closely linked to perception than that in earlier stages [1-9]. In contrast, results from functional imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and lesion studies have been interpreted as showing that earlier stages are more closely coupled to perception [10-15]. We examined whether neuronal activity in early and later stages differs in its ability to support detectable signals by measuring behavioral thresholds for detecting electrical microstimulation in different cortical areas in two monkeys. By training the animals to perform a two-alternative temporal forced-choice task, we obtained criterion-free thresholds from five visual areas--V1, V2, V3A, MT, and the inferotemporal cortex. Every site tested yielded a reliable threshold. Thresholds varied little within and between visual areas, rising gradually from early to later stages. We similarly found no systematic differences in the slopes of the psychometric detection functions from different areas. These results suggest that neuronal signals of similar magnitude evoked in any part of visual cortex can generate percepts.", "pages": "2879-92"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Role of the cerebellum in externally paced rhythmic finger movements.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9617923", "authors": ["Del Olmo, MF", "Cheeran, B", "Koch, G", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that the cerebellum has an important role in timing of subsecond intervals. Previous studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this hypothesis directly have produced inconsistent results. Here we used 1-Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) for 10 min over the right or left cerebellar hemisphere to interfere transiently with cerebellar processing to assess its effect on the performance of a finger-tapping task. Subjects tapped with their right index finger for 1 min (synchronization phase) with an auditory or visual cue at 0.5, 1, or 2 Hz; they continued for a further 1 min at the same rate with no cues (continuation phase). The blocks of trials were performed in a random order. rTMS of the cerebellum ipsilateral to the movement increased the variability of the intertap interval but only for movements at 2 Hz that were made while subjects were synchronizing with an auditory cue. There was no effect on the continuation phase of the task when the cues were no longer present or on synchronization with a visual cue. Similar results were seen after stimulation over the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex but not after rTMS over supplementary motor area. There was no effect after rTMS over the ipsilateral right cervical nerve roots or over the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. The results support the hypothesis of neural network for event-related timing in the subsecond range that involves a cerebellar-premotor network.", "pages": "2879-92"}, {"volume": "1153", "title": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity induced in resting lower limb cortex persists during subsequent walking.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10022491", "authors": ["Jayaram, G", "Santos, L", "Stinear, JW"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of human lower limb motor cortex paired with common peroneal nerve electrical stimulation produces a lasting modulation of motor cortex excitability following the principles of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We previously demonstrated that this \"paired associative stimulation\" (PAS) protocol applied during walking induced a bidirectional modulation of cortical excitability. The present study tested the hypothesis that the excitability of lower limb motor cortex assessed during walking is increased when PAS is applied to the resting cortex. PAS was delivered as a block of 120 pairs at 0.5 Hz to healthy subjects (n=13) in three separate sessions. TMS intensity was related to the active threshold obtained in tibialis anterior (TA) during the late swing phase of walking. Therefore, intensities used were below resting thresholds. When PAS using TMS intensities above active threshold was applied to the resting cortex, the normalized amplitude of potentials evoked in TA during subsequent walking increased to 124%. Using the same parameters and applying PAS during the late swing phase of walking, response amplitude increased to 114% of baseline. When the TMS intensity was set to active threshold, PAS applied to the resting cortex did not significantly modulate cortical excitability.", "pages": "2879-92"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Magnetic field therapy: a review.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10195110", "authors": ["Markov, MS"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Electromagnetic biology and medicine", "abstract": "There is increasing interest in using permanent magnets for therapeutic purposes encouraged by basic science publications and clinical reports.
