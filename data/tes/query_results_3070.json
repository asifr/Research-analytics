However, visual imagery is implicated in the normal tactile perception of some object properties, such as orientation, shape and size. Furthermore, certain tactile tasks, such as discrimination of grating orientation and object recognition, are associated with activity in areas of visual cortex. Here we show that disrupting function of the occipital cortex using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interferes with the tactile discrimination of grating orientation. The specificity of this effect is illustrated by its time course and spatial restriction over the scalp, and by the failure of occipital TMS to affect either detection of an electrical stimulus applied to the fingerpad or tactile discrimination of grating texture. In contrast, TMS over the somatosensory cortex blocked discrimination of grating texture as well as orientation. We also report that, during tactile discrimination of grating orientation, an evoked potential is recorded over posterior scalp regions with a latency corresponding to the peak of the TMS interference effect (about 180 ms). The findings indicate that visual cortex is closely involved in tactile discrimination of orientation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that visual cortical processing is necessary for normal tactile perception.", "pages": "587-90"}, {"volume": "273", "title": "Altered seizure susceptibility after high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10515182", "authors": ["Ebert, U", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The long-term effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the susceptibility of amygdala kindling was studied. Two weeks after a single high-frequency rTMS train (120 A/micros, 20 Hz for 3 s), the rats had a 55% higher threshold for induction of epileptic afterdischarges compared with sham-treated or control rats. However, subsequent kindling revealed no difference between rTMS-treated and control rats. Our data suggest that a single rTMS train has long-term effects on the neuronal excitability. These effects may be anticonvulsant and therefore support the safety of rTMS in clinical use.", "pages": "587-90"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "The silent period after magnetic brain stimulation in generalized tetanus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "10514239", "authors": ["Warren, JD", "Kimber, TE", "Thompson, PD"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "The cortical silent period has not previously been studied in tetanus.

The extensor carpi radialis muscle (ECR) was vibrated using VFs of 80, 120, and 160 Hz. Motor evoked potentials following transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded simultaneously from the vibrated ECR and the antagonist flexor carpi radialis muscle (FCR) without MV, 0.5 s and 3 s after onset of MV and 1 s after offset. Only the VFs of 80 Hz and 120 Hz caused MEP augmentation and latency shortening in ECR, whereas depression of MEPs in FCR was induced by all VFs used. It appears that MEP augmentation and latency shortening in ECR are mediated by the primary muscle spindle endings which respond with optimal discharge rates to VFs of up to 100 Hz. Motor evoked potential depression in FCR, being well expressed also with VF 160 Hz, seems to involve other dynamic mechanoreceptors.", "pages": "587-90"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Effects of spontaneous recanalization on functional and electrophysiological recovery in acute ischemic stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "10512916", "authors": ["Vang, C", "Dunbabin, D", "Kilpatrick, D"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) studies have shown that spontaneous recanalization results in a better clinical improvement after the onset of stroke.

Further, we explored the characteristics of projection to pelvic floor muscles from the lateral vestibular nucleus of the brainstem. ICMS reliably produced responses from both recorded muscles, levator ani (LA) and external ani sphincter (EAS). Responses could be obtained both from ipsi and contralateral sides, being shorter for the contralateral ones. In contrast, vestibular stimulation activates only the EAS.

These findings are unlike the observations made in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, where significant changes of postexcitatory inhibition after TMS can be observed.
