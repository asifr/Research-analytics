The motor cortex can be inhibited by intracortical mechanisms and by peripheral sensory inputs. We examined whether cortical inhibition from peripheral sensory input is mediated through previously identified intracortical inhibitory systems and how these inhibitory systems interact. Two types of intracortical inhibition were assessed by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was determined with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (CS) followed by a test stimulus 2 ms later and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) with suprathreshold conditioning and test stimuli 100 ms apart. Cortical inhibition from peripheral sensory input was induced by median nerve stimulation (MNS) of the right hand and followed by a suprathreshold TMS over the left motor cortex 200 ms later. The first set of experiments tested the effects of different test stimulus intensities on SICI, LICI and cortical inhibition induced by median nerve stimulation (MNSI). With higher test stimulus intensities, LICI and MNSI decreased whereas SICI showed a trend towards an increase. The extent of SICI, LICI and MNSI did not correlate. The second experiment assessed the interaction between MNSI and LICI. The results of applying MNSI and LICI simultaneously were compared with MNSI and LICI alone. MNSI was virtually abolished in the presence of LICI and LICI was also significantly decreased in the presence of MNSI. Thus, the effects of MNSI and LICI when applied together were much less than their expected additive effects when applied alone. The degree of interaction between MNSI and LICI was related to the combined strength of MNSI and LICI but not to the strength of LICI alone. The third experiment investigated the interaction between SICI and MNSI. MNSI and SICI were applied together and the results were compared with MNSI and SICI alone. SICI remained unchanged in the presence of MNSI. We conclude that MNSI is mediated by circuits distinct from those mediating LICI or SICI. The MNSI circuits seem to have an inhibitory interaction with the LICI circuits, whereas the SICI and MNSI circuits do not seem to interact.", "pages": "617-29"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Use of transcranial micropolarization in the treatment of tension headaches].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "8797526", "authors": ["Chutko, LS", "Kropotov, IuD", "Iakovenko, EA", "Surushkina, SIu", "Anisimova, TI"], "year": "", "journal": "Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebno\u012d fizichesko\u012d kultury", "abstract": "The study was made of effectiveness of transcranial micropolarization (TSMP) in the treatment of tension headache (TH).

In order to better understand the haemodynamic changes underlining the clinical improvement, we have studied with transcranial Doppler (TCD), SPECT and NIRS 18 patients harbouring a stroke. SPECT Group: An increase of regional CBF during SCS was measured far from the stroke areas in 9 patients, further decrease in CBF was found in 2, no changes in 1. TCD Group: An increase of CBF velocities during SCS was found in 4 patients, no changes in 6, a decrease in 1. NIRS Group: Data consistent with and increase in CBF were obtained during SCS in the only patient undergone such a study. In 6 patients studied with different techniques, data obtained fitted only in 2 patients. In 3 patients no changes in TCD faced with changes in SPECT. In one case an improvement in TCD was evident in the left while an improvement of SPECT was shown in the right site. SCS is a valid therapeutic tool in stroke patient even if, as matter of fact, parallelism between clinical and haemodynamic changes during SCS is not demonstrated in our patients, rising the question on the role of ischemic penumbra in mediating clinical improvement.", "pages": "617-29"}, {"volume": "146", "title": "Fatigue suppresses ipsilateral intracortical facilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "9020819", "authors": ["B\u00e4umer, T", "M\u00fcnchau, A", "Weiller, C", "Liepert, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Interactions between these cortical areas can be explored with electrical or magnetic stimulation. In the present study we examined the interhemispheric effect of fatigue on intracortical facilitation (ICF) and inhibition (ICI) using a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm. Ten healthy subjects performed pinch grips with their left hand with 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) until fatigue occurred. In the control experiment, the same number of pinch grips was performed with 5% MVC without inducing fatigue. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) produced by single and paired pulse TMS over the left motor cortex were recorded from right first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) and right abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM) before and after the tasks. ICF of the right FDI was significantly reduced after fatigue ( P=0.0008). Fifteen minutes after finishing the task ICF had returned to baseline values. There was no change of ICF of right FDI in the control experiment without inducing fatigue. In both experiments the right ADM did not show significant MEP changes. Additional control experiments showed that M-responses and F-waves were unchanged in right FDI after performing the fatigue task with left FDI, and TMS test pulse amplitudes were significantly reduced in left FDI after fatigue. Fatigue caused by pinch grips induces a short-lasting and task-specific suppression of intracortical facilitation in the motor cortex of an homologous contralateral hand muscle. These results indicate interhemispheric interactions between the two motor cortices that are still effective after cessation of movements.", "pages": "617-29"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Selective priming of syntactic processing by event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation of Broca's area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "9051592", "authors": ["Sakai, KL", "Noguchi, Y", "Takeuchi, T", "Watanabe, E"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuron", "abstract": "It remains controversial whether Broca's aphasia is an articulatory deficit, a lexical-access problem, or agrammatism.

Here we report an experiment with event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to clarify the role of Broca's area, more specifically, the left inferior frontal gyrus (F3op/F3t), in syntactic processing. An experimental paradigm contrasted sentences requiring syntactic decisions with those requiring semantic decisions. We found selective priming effects on syntactic decisions when TMS was administered to the left F3op/F3t at a specific timing, but not to the left middle frontal gyrus (F2). Our results provide direct evidence of the involvement of the left F3op/F3t in syntactic processing.", "pages": "617-29"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Transient storage of a tactile memory trace in primary somatosensory cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "19", "pmid": "9284235", "authors": ["Harris, JA", "Miniussi, C", "Harris, IM", "Diamond, ME"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Working memory is known to involve prefrontal cortex and posterior regions of association cortex (e.g., the inferior temporal lobes).

Their performance was significantly disrupted when we delivered a pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the contralateral SI early (300 or 600 msec) in the retention interval. TMS did not affect tactile working memory if delivered to contralateral SI late in the retention interval (at 900 or 1200 msec), nor did TMS affect performance if delivered to the ipsilateral SI at any time point. Primary sensory cortex thus seems to act not only as a center for on-line sensory processing but also as a transient storage site for information that contributes to working memory.", "pages": "617-29"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Transcranial electrical stimulation: significance of fast versus slow charge delivery for intra-operative monitoring.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "9339689", "authors": ["Hausmann, ON", "Min, K", "Boos, N", "Ruetsch, YA", "Erni, T", "Curt, A"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) for intra-operative monitoring due to fast charge (fc: 1.0 Coulomb/s) and slow charge (sc: 0.1Coulomb/s) delivery for multipulse transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) were compared.", "pages": "617-29"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Vagus nerve stimulation therapy: a research update.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6 Suppl 4", "pmid": "9535577", "authors": ["George, MS", "Nahas, Z", "Bohning, DE", "Kozel, FA", "Anderson, B", "Chae, JH", "Lomarev, M", "Denslow, S", "Li, X", "Mu, C"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "MEPs due to fc (n=162) and sc stimulation (n=182) were performed in parallel in a prospective study.
