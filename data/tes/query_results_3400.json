In addition, the maximum M wave (Mmax) after supra-maximal electrical ulnar nerve stimulation and the peripheral silent period (PSP) have been tested as parameters of peripheral motor excitability. Baseline measurements were compared with data obtained on a mean ethanol blood concentration of 0.8 ml/l. Resting and active motor thresholds remained unchanged. Also, the absolute Mmax values and the MEP/Mmax ratio at various TMS intensities were not affected by ethanol. The mean CSP duration was prolonged by up to 35 ms while the PSP duration showed no change. The principal effect of ethanol was an enhancement of intracortical inhibition and a suppression of intracortical facilitation. These results are discussed in relation to data from animal experiments which have shown a potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated currents as the main mode of action of ethanol in the mammalian cortex. It is suggested that CSP and intracortical inhibition reflect the activation of cortical GABAergic mechanisms by TMS, while motor threshold does not.", "pages": "1437-46"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Afferent excitation of human motor cortex as revealed by enhancement of direct cortico-spinal actions on motoneurones.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "8536591", "authors": ["Baldissera, F", "Leocani, L"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Changes in motor cortex excitability induced by somatosensory afferences were evaluated in 5 subjects by testing how the short-latency cortico-spinal effects evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in flexor carpi radialis (FCR) motoneurones were influenced by volleys in median nerve afferent fibres. Transcranial magnetic stimulation induced two facilitatory peaks on FCR H reflex, the first at a conditioning-test interval of about -3 msec and the second at msec, separated by a phase of inhibition. If an electric shock to the median nerve at the wrist, 0.8-1 x motor threshold (MT) for thenar muscles, preceded the cortical stimulus by 18-25 msec, an increase in size of both facilitatory peaks was observed. The increase was partly due to a direct action of the median nerve volley on motoneurones. When this contribution was subtracted, two peaks of additional facilitation resulted as the effect of combined conditioning. Additional facilitation was present even during the short-lasting phase ascribed to monosynaptic cortico-spinal excitation of motoneurones, i.e., the first millisecond of the earliest facilitatory peak. This result indicates that cortical responsiveness to magnetic stimulation had been enhanced by the peripheral stimulus. The time course of the excitability changes in motor cortex was compared with the cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) induced by the same peripheral stimulus. Additional facilitation was present immediately after the N20 peak of SEPs and lasted 8-10 msec. Additional facilitation had the same threshold as N20 (0.6 x MT) and grew in parallel with it when grading the afferent stimulus up to 1 MT.", "pages": "1437-46"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Input-output organization in the hand area of the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "8536588", "authors": ["Terao, Y", "Ugawa, Y", "Uesaka, Y", "Hanajima, R", "Gemba-Shimizu, K", "Ohki, Y", "Kanazawa, I"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The primate motor cortex consists of efferent zones which receive sensory information from a portion of limb in close anatomical relation to the muscle to which they project. To investigate a similar input-output relation in humans, we studied the effect of tactile stimuli on the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation. For tactile stimuli we applied air to the skin. The sizes of MEP of 3 finger muscles (flexor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interosseous, and abductor digiti minimi) with and without air stimuli were compared. Air stimuli applied to the tip of one finger facilitated mainly the magnetically evoked MEP of a muscle attached to that finger. A less obvious facilitatory effect was observed when giving stimuli on the dorsal aspect of the hand. Air stimuli had no facilitatory effect on electrically evoked MEPs. In one subject, there was no facilitatory effect even to magnetically evoked MEPs. In this subject, D-waves had the lowest threshold for magnetic and electrical stimulation. These results suggested that the effect was produced at the cortical level.

Observations were made on seven human subjects with electrodes implanted in the cerebellar thalamus for the control of tremor. 2. Weak stimulation at 1-2 Hz resulted in sudden lapses of posture of actively contracting contralateral limb muscles. Stronger stimuli caused muscle twitches even in relaxed muscles. 3. The stronger stimuli produced short latency facilitation of EMG activity in contralateral muscles; the pattern of muscle facilitation, the conduction velocity of the descending pathway and the estimated rise time of the underlying composite EPSP were consistent with direct activation of the corticospinal tract. 4. The lapses of posture produced by the weaker stimuli were associated with inhibition of ongoing EMG for up to 150 ms. This was due to the interruption of tonic drive to motoneurons rather than to their inhibition and was associated with depression of the motor evoked potential in relaxed muscles produced by weak anodal transcranial stimulation. The inhibition could be produced by 0.1 ms pulses, implying that a large-diameter fibre system was being activated. 5. A number of mechanisms could contribute to the inhibition, including inhibition from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus.", "pages": "1437-46"}, {"volume": "699", "title": "The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation of rat brain on behavioral models of depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "1102064", "authors": ["Fleischmann, A", "Prolov, K", "Abarbanel, J", "Belmaker, RH"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Magnetic stimulation of the brain in unanesthetized humans and animals can painlessly induce motor movements and has recently been reported to have antidepressant properties.

The early part of the SP can be explained by decreased alpha motor neuron excitability, whereas the late part is presumably due to suprasegmental mechanisms. In order to determine the level of the suprasegmental contribution of the generation of SPs, we recorded excitatory and inhibitory responses to TMS, TES and percutaneous electrical brainstem stimulation (PBS) in the voluntarily activated first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand. Stimulus intensities were set so that PBS and TES induced MEPs with areas equal to or larger than those of MEPs obtained with TMS. This procedure revealed that SPs were 49% and 83% shorter with TES and PBS, respectively, than with TMS. As TMS is more effective than TES or PBS in activating cortical interneurons, these findings support the idea that a significant component of the SP arises from intracortical mechanisms.", "pages": "1437-46"}, {"volume": "488 ( Pt 3)", "title": "Task-related variation in corticospinal output evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the macaque monkey.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "1293281", "authors": ["Baker, SN", "Olivier, E", "Lemon, RN"], "year": "1995", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1.
