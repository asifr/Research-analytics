The movements were characterized by rhythmic EMG bursts lasting less than 50 msec and appearing synchronously in agonist and antagonist muscles at a rate of 9 to 18 Hz. Backaveraging of the EEG activity related to the onset of the rhythmic EMG bursts identified a cortical potential preceding the EMG bursts in all patients. These symptoms and signs fit the description of \"cortical tremor,\" a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus. Cortical tremor is common in patients with cortical myoclonus and may be a source of functional disability. In two patients in whom we studied the effects of graded levels of isometric force, force recruitment modulated the abnormal EMG bursting frequency, amplitude, and spatial distribution of the myoclonic jerks in the activated limb. Transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation, but not peripheral nerve stimulation, influenced the abnormal EMG bursting pattern, implying a greater dependence of this rhythmic phenomenon on a central generator than on peripheral feedback loops.", "pages": "2346-53"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Recent advances in non-invasive studies of higher brain functions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "8147500", "authors": ["Shibasaki, H"], "year": "", "journal": "Brain & development", "abstract": "Recent advances in modern technologies have enabled us to investigate higher brain functions non-invasively in human subjects.

In ten normal volunteers, a transcranial magnetic or electric stimulus that was subthreshold for evoking an EMG response in relaxed muscles was used to condition responses evoked by a later, suprathreshold magnetic or electric test shock. In most experiments the test stimulus was given to the lateral part of the motor strip in order to evoke EMG responses in the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). 2. A magnetic conditioning stimulus over the hand area of cortex could suppress responses produced in the relaxed FDI by a suprathreshold magnetic test stimulus at interstimulus intervals of 1-6 ms. At interstimulus intervals of 10 and 15 ms, the test response was facilitated. 3. Using a focal magnetic stimulus we explored the effects of moving the conditioning stimulus to different scalp locations while maintaining the magnetic test coil at one site. If the conditioning coil was moved anterior or posterior to the motor strip there was less suppression of test responses in the FDI. In contrast, stimulation at the vertex could suppress FDI responses by an amount comparable to that seen with stimulation over the hand area. With the positions of the two coils reversed, conditioning stimuli over the hand area suppressed responses evoked in leg muscles by vertex test shocks. 4. The intensity of both conditioning and test shocks influenced the amount of suppression. Small test responses were more readily suppressed than large responses. The best suppression was seen with small conditioning stimuli (0.7-0.9 times motor threshold in relaxed muscle); increasing the intensity to motor threshold or above resulted in less suppression or even facilitation. 5. Two experiments suggested that the suppression was produced by an action on cortical, rather than spinal excitability. First, a magnetic conditioning stimulus over the hand area failed to produce any suppression of responses evoked in active hand muscles by a small (approximately 200 V, 50 microsecond time constant) anodal electric test shock. Second, a vertex conditioning shock had no effect on forearm flexor H reflexes even though responses in the same muscles produced by magnetic cortical test shocks were readily suppressed at appropriate interstimulus intervals. 6. Small anodal electric conditioning stimuli were much less effective in suppressing magnetic test responses than either magnetic or cathodal electric conditioning shocks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "2346-53"}, {"volume": "470", "title": "Respiratory sensations, cardiovascular control, kinaesthesia and transcranial stimulation during paralysis in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "1293281", "authors": ["Gandevia, SC", "Killian, K", "McKenzie, DK", "Crawford, M", "Allen, GM", "Gorman, RB", "Hales, JP"], "year": "1993", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. To determine whether discomfort associated with breathing (dyspnoea) is related to the chemical drive to breath, three subjects were totally paralysed while fully conscious. Subjective responses to a rising CO2 stimulus were obtained during rebreathing, rebreathing with CO2 added, and breath holding. Dyspnoea was measured with a 10-point Borg scale. 2. Following nasotracheal intubation and ventilation (oxygen saturation, O2,Sat, 98-100% and end-tidal CO2, PET,CO2, 30-40 mmHg), total neuromuscular blockade was induced by a rapid injection of atracurium (> 2.5 mg kg-1) and complete paralysis was maintained with an infusion (5 mg (kg h)-1). Paralysis was confirmed by abolition of the compound muscle action potentials of both the diaphragm and abductor hallucis evoked by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the relevant nerves. Communication via finger movement was preserved for the first 20-30 min following paralysis by inflation of a sphygmomanometer cuff on one arm. 3. Before and during complete paralysis, dyspnoea increased progressively during hypercapnia produced by rebreathing (with or without CO2 added to the circuit at 250 ml min-1). The mean PET,CO2 eliciting 'severe' dyspnoea was 46 mmHg during rebreathing, 42 mmHg during 'breath holding', and 52 mmHg during rebreathing with added CO2. There were no significant differences between the values obtained during paralysis and in the control study immediately before paralysis. The duration of breath holding was not prolonged by paralysis and the PET,CO2 at the 'break point' was not altered by paralysis. 4. Thus, dyspnoea is preserved following total neuromuscular blockade. This suggests that chemoreceptor activity, via the central neuronal activity which it evokes, can lead to discomfort in the absence of any contraction of respiratory muscles. 5. During paralysis, attempted contraction of arm, leg and trunk muscles increased heart rate and blood pressure. For attempted handgrip contractions, the increases in heart rate (range, 7-15 beats min-1) and mean arterial pressure (range, 20-32 mmHg) were similar to those recorded with actual contractions in trials immediately before paralysis. In one subject, graded increases in heart rate and blood pressure occurred for attempted contractions of 45 s duration over a range of intensities (0-100% maximal effort). 6. During complete paralysis, transcranial electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex produced illusory twitch-like movements of the wrist and digits. This also occurred in separate studies during complete ischaemic paralysis and anaesthesia of the forearm and hand.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "2346-53"}, {"volume": "470", "title": "Direct comparison of corticospinal volleys in human subjects to transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "6035693", "authors": ["Burke, D", "Hicks, R", "Gandevia, SC", "Stephen, J", "Woodforth, I", "Crawford, M"], "year": "1993", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. The effects of graded transcranial magnetic and anodal electrical stimulation of the human motor cortex were compared in human subjects undergoing orthopaedic operations on the spine, before and after withdrawal of volatile anaesthesia. Corticospinal volleys were recorded from the spinal cord in the low-cervical and low-thoracic regions (six subjects) or the mid-thoracic region (two subjects) using bipolar electrodes inserted into the epidural space. 2. Electrical stimuli were delivered using anode at the vertex and cathode 7 cm laterally. The corticospinal volley at threshold consisted of a single deflection with a mean latency to peak of 4.17 ms at the rostral recording site. With further increases in stimulus strength the latency of this D wave shortened in two steps, first by 0.89 ms (seven subjects) and then by a further 0.8 ms (two subjects), indicating that the site of activation of some corticospinal neurones had shifted to deep subcortical sites. 3. When volatile anaesthetics were given, a corticospinal volley could not be defined in three subjects with magnetic stimuli of 70, 80 and 100% maximal stimulator output with the coil at the vertex (Novametrix Magstim 200, round coil, external diameter 14 cm). In the remaining five subjects, the component of lowest threshold was a D wave recorded at the rostral site at 4.0 ms when stimulus intensity was, on average, 70%. With stimuli of 90-100% a total of five small I waves could be defined in the five subjects (i.e. on average one I wave per subject). 4. After cessation of volatile anaesthetics in seven subjects, the thresholds for D and I waves were lower and their amplitudes were greater. The D wave remained the component of lowest threshold in all subjects, appearing at the low-cervical level with magnetic stimuli of 50%. However, in three subjects I waves also appeared at D wave threshold, and the D wave was smaller than with electrical stimulation at I wave threshold. There was no consistent change in latency of the magnetic D wave as stimulus intensity was increased to 100%. 5. These findings suggest that the previously reported difference in latency of the EMG potentials produced in upper-limb muscles by anodal stimulation and magnetic stimulation of the human motor cortex is not because the corticospinal volley induced by magnetic stimulation lacks a D wave.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "2346-53"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "[Central and peripheral nervous system motor conduction rate in HIV infection].", "keywords": [], "issue": "28", "pmid": "1841949", "authors": ["Grapperon, J", "Trousset, A", "Jaubert, D"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Presse m\u00e9dicale (Paris, France : 1983)", "abstract": "In order to assess the central motor pathways of HIV-infected patients motor evoked potentials were recorded on the upper limbs after transcranial and cervical magnetic stimulations and compared with peripheral conduction velocities.

Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and the Blink reflex, in response to magnetic stimulation, were investigated. Subjects were 10 normal controls and 2 Bell's palsy patients. CMAPs were elicited in the orbicularis oris muscle by magnetic stimulation at the parieto-occipital skull and stylomastoid foramen. Furthermore, CMAPs were evoked by a magnetic coil oriented over the cortex. CMAP recording was possible with magnetic stimulation and the latencies of CMAPs at the parieto-occipital skull were slightly greater than those at the stylomastoid foramen. In 10 normal subjects, the mean onset latency following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve at the parieto-occipital skull was 5.07 msec (SD = 0.40), while transcutaneous latency at the stylomastoid foramen was 2.77msec (SD = 0.539). In the blink reflex, R1 latency was 10.99 msec (SD = 1.27), ipsilateral-R2 latency was 37.46 msec (SD = 2.57), and contralateral-R2 latency was 38.925 msec (SD = 3.20). The blink reflex thus had a configuration similar to that evoked by conventional electrical stimulation. In the patients with Bell's palsy, CMAPs elicited by magnetic stimulation were of low amplitude with normal latency. However, in the blink reflex, only a contralateral R2 response could be recorded, and R1 and ipsilateral-R2 showed no response to stimulation at the affected side.
