Human brain lesion studies have found that the loss of dreaming is characterized by damage to the frontal and posterior parieto-temporo-occipital association cortex. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the function of these brain regions might encapsulate the neural processes of dreaming. The aim of the following two experiments was to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs), applied simultaneously to the frontal and right posterior parietal cortex during Stage 2 sleep, on dreaming. In Experiment 1, 17 healthy participants received tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) and low-intensity tDCs as well as no tDCs (blank control) during Stage 2 sleep in a counterbalanced order across the night. Dream reports were collected upon awakening after each of the three conditions. In Experiment 2, 10 participants received tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal), no tDCs (blank control) and two additional control conditions (reversed polarity and other-cephalic tDCs). In both experiments a significantly greater number of imagery reports were found on awakening after tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal), compared to the blank control conditions. However, in Experiment 2 the frequency of imagery reports from the tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) was not significantly different from the other two tDC conditions, suggesting a non-specific effect of tDCs. Overall, it was concluded that tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) increased the frequency of dream reports with visual imagery, possibly via a general arousing effect and/or recreating specific cortical neural activity involved in dreaming.", "pages": "369-79"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Contribution of axonal orientation to pathway-dependent modulation of excitatory transmission by direct current stimulation in isolated rat hippocampus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "22219028", "authors": ["Kabakov, AY", "Muller, PA", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Jensen, FE", "Rotenberg, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method for modulating cortical excitability by weak constant electrical current that is applied through scalp electrodes. Although often described in terms of anodal or cathodal stimulation, depending on which scalp electrode pole is proximal to the cortical region of interest, it is the orientation of neuronal structures relative to the direct current (DC) vector that determines the effect of tDCS. To investigate the contribution of neural pathway orientation, we studied DCS-mediated neuromodulation in an in vitro rat hippocampal slice preparation. We examined the contribution of dendritic orientation to the direct current stimulation (DCS) neuromodulatory effect by recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in apical and basal dendrites of CA1 neurons within a constant DC field. In addition, we assessed the contribution of axonal orientation by recording CA1 and CA3 apical fEPSPs generated by stimulation of oppositely oriented Schaffer collateral and mossy fiber axons, respectively, during DCS. Finally, nonsynaptic excitatory signal propagation was measured along antidromically stimulated CA1 axons at different DCS amplitudes and polarity. We find that modulation of both the fEPSP and population spike depends on axonal orientation relative to the electric field vector. Axonal orientation determines whether the DC field is excitatory or inhibitory and dendritic orientation affects the magnitude, but not the overall direction, of the DC effect. These data suggest that tDCS may oppositely affect neurons in a stimulated cortical volume if these neurons are excited by oppositely orientated axons in a constant electrical field.", "pages": "369-79"}, {"volume": "200", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation for depression: 3-week, randomised, sham-controlled trial.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14244793", "authors": ["Loo, CK", "Alonzo, A", "Martin, D", "Mitchell, PB", "Galvez, V", "Sachdev, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "Preliminary evidence suggests transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has antidepressant efficacy.", "pages": "369-79"}, {"volume": "200", "title": "Transcranial stimulation in depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16035225", "authors": ["Allan, C", "Kalu, UG", "Sexton, CE", "Ebmeier, KP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "To further investigate the efficacy of tDCS in a double-blind, sham-controlled trial (registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00763230).", "pages": "369-79"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Focal hand dystonia: lack of evidence for abnormality of motor representation at rest.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17293046", "authors": ["Weise, D", "Gentner, R", "Zeller, D", "Nagel, A", "Reinsberger, C", "Rumpf, JJ", "Classen, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Sixty-four participants with current depression received active or sham anodal tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex (2 mA, 15 sessions over 3 weeks), followed by a 3-week open-label active treatment phase.
