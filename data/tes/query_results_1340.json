Although the suppression of this tendency is integral to tasks of daily living, its exploitation may prove to be critical in the rehabilitation of acquired hemiplegias. Transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation induces changes in cortical excitability that outlast the period of application. We present evidence that changes in the reactivity of the corticospinal pathway induced by DC stimulation of the motor cortex interact systematically with those brought about by contraction of the muscles of the ipsilateral limb. During the application of flexion torques (up to 50% of maximum) applied at the left wrist, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were evoked in the quiescent muscles of the right arm by magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex (M1). The MEPs were obtained prior to and following 10 min of anodal, cathodal or sham DC stimulation of left M1. Cathodal stimulation counteracted increases in the crossed-facilitation of projections to the (right) wrist flexors that otherwise occurred as a result of repeated flexion contractions at the left wrist. In addition, cathodal stimulation markedly decreased the excitability of corticospinal projections to the wrist extensors of the right limb. Thus changes in corticospinal excitability induced by DC stimulation can be shaped (i.e. differentiated by muscle group) by focal contractions of muscles in the limb ipsilateral to the site of stimulation.", "pages": "192-205"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Cortical plasticity induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation during wakefulness affects electroencephalogram activity during sleep.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "18575583", "authors": ["De Gennaro, L", "Fratello, F", "Marzano, C", "Moroni, F", "Curcio, G", "Tempesta, D", "Pellicciari, MC", "Pirulli, C", "Ferrara, M", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "The frontal eye fields (FEFs) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are important for target detection in conjunction visual search but the relative timings of their contribution have not been compared directly.

Static images as well as videos of actions with the outcome occluded have been shown to activate the hMNS. However, whether the hMNS preferentially responds to end or means of an action remains to be investigated. We, therefore, presented subjects with videos of intentional actions that were shown from two perspectives (factor 1, perspective: first vs. third person) while subjects directed their attention to the means or the end thereof (factor 2, task: means vs. end). End- or means-related changes in BOLD signal and corticospinal excitability (CSE) were assessed using fMRI and TMS, respectively. Judging the means of an action compared with its end differentially activated bilateral ventral premotor (vPMC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPL), that is, the core regions of the hMNS. The reverse contrast revealed left precuneus and bilateral superior frontal, angular, and middle temporal gyrus activity. In accordance, the two tasks, although identically in stimulus properties, modulated CSE differentially. Although recent studies suggest that the hMNS may prefer the presence of a goal or context, our data show that within the same context, it responds preferentially when attention is directed to the action means. Consequently, in addition to inferring action goals, a key function of the hMNS may be to anticipate the trajectories and dynamics of observed actions, which is a prerequisite for any timely interaction.", "pages": "192-205"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Differential effects of endurance and resistance training on central fatigue.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "18204445", "authors": ["Triscott, S", "Gordon, J", "Kuppuswamy, A", "King, N", "Davey, N", "Ellaway, P"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of sports sciences", "abstract": "Efficacy of antidepressants fluvoxamine, amitriptyline and transcranial electrostimulation of the brain in the treatment of chronic daily headache has been studied.
