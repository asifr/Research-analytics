The latencies of motor evoked potentials were normal in all patients. After stimulation of the ischaemic hemisphere we obtained responses comparable with the contralateral ones in two patients (mean NIH score 2 (SD 0)) and this group was completely asymptomatic after 15 days (NIH score 0). In four patients the excitability of the motor cortex involved by the ischaemia was reduced and magnetic motor threshold was higher than that of the spared motor cortex. This finding was associated with a poor motor recovery and the NIH score after 15 days was unchanged (NIH score 1.75 (SD 1.5)). The present data suggest that the evaluation of the excitability of motor cortex may offer a mean of predicting functional outcome following stroke.", "pages": "119-21"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Electrical stimulation of rat medial prefrontal cortex enhances forebrain serotonin output: implications for electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10457536", "authors": ["Juckel, G", "Mendlin, A", "Jacobs, BL"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Decreased activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as reduced serotonergic neurotransmission, is considered as a characteristic feature of major depression. The mechanism by which electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) achieve their antidepressant effects may involve changes in PFC activity. It is, however, still unclear whether these changes are accompanied by increased synaptic availability of serotonin (5-HT). In the present study, 5-HT efflux in the rat ventral hippocampus and amygdala was analyzed using in vivo microdialysis during low-current electrical stimulation of PFC and other cortical regions. Electrical stimulation of the medial PFC produced current-dependent increases in limbic 5-HT output in both urethane-anesthetized and behaving rats. No effects on 5-HT levels were seen after comparable stimulation of either the lateral parts of the PFC, the medial precentral area, the primary motor cortex or the parietal cortex. This pronounced regional specificity of the effect of medial PFC stimulation on limbic 5-HT output suggests that activation of this particular area might play a crucial role in such antidepressant treatments as ECT and TMS.", "pages": "119-21"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "Inhibition of the human primary motor area by painful heat stimulation of the skin.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "10454286", "authors": ["Valeriani, M", "Restuccia, D", "Di Lazzaro, V", "Oliviero, A", "Profice, P", "Le Pera, D", "Saturno, E", "Tonali, P"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To prove whether painful cutaneous stimuli can affect specifically the motor cortex excitability.", "pages": "119-21"}, {"volume": "174", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10448456", "authors": ["Moore, B"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "The electromyographic (EMG) responses, recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle after either transcranial magnetic or electric anodal stimulation of the primary motor (MI) cortex, was conditioned by both painful and non-painful CO2 laser stimuli delivered on the hand skin.", "pages": "119-21"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "The relationship between evoked potentials and measurements of S-100 protein in cerebrospinal fluid during and after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10436449", "authors": ["van Dongen, EP", "ter Beek, HT", "Schepens, MA", "Morshuis, WJ", "Haas, FJ", "de Boer, A", "Boezeman, EH", "Aarts, LP"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery", "abstract": "Painful CO2 laser stimuli reduced the amplitude of the EMG responses evoked by the transcranial magnetic stimulation of both the contralateral and ipsilateral MI areas.
