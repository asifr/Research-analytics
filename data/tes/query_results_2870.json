We examined the effect of reversing the direction of the induced current in the brain from the usual posterior-anterior (PA) direction to an anterior-posterior (AP) direction. The volleys were compared with D waves evoked by anodal electrical stimulation (two subjects) or medio-lateral magnetic stimulation (two subjects). As reported previously, PA stimulation preferentially recruited I1 waves, with later I waves appearing at higher stimulus intensities. AP stimulation tended to recruit later I waves (I3 waves) in one of the subjects, but, in the other three, I1 or D waves were seen. Unexpectedly, the descending volleys evoked by AP stimulation often had slightly different peak latencies and/or longer duration than those seen after PA stimulation. In addition the relationship between the size of the descending volleys and the subsequent EMG response was often different for AP and PA stimulation. These findings suggest that AP stimulation does not simply activate a subset of the sites activated by PA stimulation. Some sites or neurones that are relatively inaccessible to PA stimulation may be the low-threshold targets of AP stimulation.", "pages": "268-73"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "The role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during sequence learning is specific for spatial information.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "11415965", "authors": ["Robertson, EM", "Tormos, JM", "Maeda, F", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Many studies have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the acquisition of skill, including procedural sequence learning. However, the specific role it performs in sequence learning has remained uncertain. This type of skill has been intensively studied using the serial reaction time task. We used three versions of this task: a standard task where the position of the stimulus cued the response; a non-standard task where the color of the stimulus was related to the correct response; and a combined task where both the color and position simultaneously cued the response. We refer to each of these tasks based upon the cues available for guiding learning as position, color and combined tasks. The combined task usually shows an enhancement of skill acquisition, a result of being driven by two simultaneous and congruent cues. Prior to the performance of each of these tasks the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was disrupted using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. This completely prevented learning within the position task, while sequence learning occurred to a similar extent in both the color and combined tasks. So, following prefrontal stimulation the expected learning enhancement in the combined task was lost, consistent with only a color cue being available to guide sequence learning in the combined task. Neither of these effects was observed following stimulation at the parietal cortex. Hence the critical role played by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in sequence learning is related exclusively to spatial cues. We suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operates over the short term to retain and manipulate spatial information to allow cortical and subcortical structures to learn a predictable sequence of actions. Such functions may emerge from the broader role the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has in spatial working memory. These results argue against the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex constituting part of the neuronal substrate responsible for general aspects of implicit or explicit sequence learning.", "pages": "268-73"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Parieto-frontal interactions in visual-object and visual-spatial working memory: evidence from transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "11415963", "authors": ["Oliveri, M", "Turriziani, P", "Carlesimo, GA", "Koch, G", "Tomaiuolo, F", "Panella, M", "Caltagirone, C"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can induce selective working memory (WM) deficits of visual-object versus visual-spatial information in normal humans. Thirty-five healthy subjects performed two computerized visual n-back tasks, in which they were required to memorize spatial locations or abstract patterns. In a first series of experiments, unilateral or bilateral TMS was delivered on posterior parietal and middle temporal regions of both hemispheres after various delays during the WM task. Bilateral temporal TMS increased reaction times (RTs) in the visual-object, whereas bilateral parietal TMS selectively increased RTs in the visual-spatial WM task. These effects were evident at a delay of 300 ms. Response accuracy was not affected by bilateral or unilateral TMS of either cortical region. In a second group of experiments, bilateral TMS was applied over the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). TMS of the SFG selectively increased RTs in the visual-spatial WM task, whereas TMS of the DLPFC interfered with both WM tasks, in terms of both accuracy and RTs. These effects were evident when TMS was applied after a delay of 600 ms, but not one of 300 ms. These findings confirm the segregation of WM buffers for object and spatial information in the posterior cortical regions. In the frontal cortex, the DLPFC appears to be necessary for WM computations regardless of the stimulus material.", "pages": "268-73"}, {"volume": "306", "title": "Increased variability of paced finger tapping accuracy following repetitive magnetic stimulation of the cerebellum in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "11403950", "authors": ["Th\u00e9oret, H", "Haque, J", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Imaging and lesion studies suggest that the cerebellum is involved in the self-generation of timed motor responses.

Results show greater variability on the PFT task following a 5 min train of 1 Hz rTMS to the medial cerebellum. Magnetic stimulation of the lateral cerebellum or motor cortex, and sham stimulation, had no effect on performance. Expanding the results of neuroimaging studies, these data show the causal link between activity in the medial cerebellum and the production of timed movements. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility of transiently disrupting the cerebellum by rTMS and inducing behavioral effects.

We investigated motor cortical excitability using multimodal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and 1 month after MST, in which surgical cortical incisions were made with strokes 5 mm apart and 4 mm deep. Preoperative TMS studies showed hyperexcitability in the affected motor cortex as abnormally prolonged muscle responses to TMS with a wide cortical motor map, which were markedly reduced following the operation. The preoperative motor evoked potentials were large and polyphasic, and consisted of early and late components. The late component was completely abolished after MST, suggesting that this component might be due to activation of the corticospinal tract neurones by long recurrent axon branches of dysplastic excitatory pyramidal neurones, which were cut by MST, or by delayed, polysynaptic intracortical conduction with marked temporal dispersion. Intracortical inhibition in the affected motor cortex was also disrupted preoperatively and improved after MST. Postoperative recruitment order of muscle responses to TMS was bilaterally symmetrical, indicating that MST did not interfere with the function of the corticospinal tract neurones. The patient showed fair motor recovery and good seizure control after the operation. These results of TMS studies demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of MST not only on intractable seizure but also on abnormal motor cortical organization and hyperexcitability in cortical dysgenesis.", "pages": "268-73"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Phase-specific modulation of cortical motor output during movement observation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "11388435", "authors": ["Gangitano, M", "Mottaghy, FM", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "The effects of different phases of an observed movement on the modulation of cortical motor output were studied by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
