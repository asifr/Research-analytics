This study was designed to determine the effect of different frequencies of NMES applied over the common peroneal nerve on changes in CS excitability for the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. We hypothesized that higher frequencies of stimulation would produce larger increases in CS excitability than lower frequencies. NMES was applied at 10, 50, 100, or 200 Hz during separate sessions held at least 48 h apart. The stimulation was delivered in a 20 s on, 20 s off cycle for 40 min using a 1 ms pulse width. The intensity of stimulation was set to evoke an M-wave in response to a single pulse that was 15% of the maximal M-wave. CS excitability was evaluated by the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in TA evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation. MEPs were recorded immediately before and after the 40 min of NMES and in each 20 s \"off\" period. For each subject, MEPs recorded during three successive \"off\" periods were averaged together (n = 9 MEPs), providing a temporal resolution of 2 min for assessing changes in CS excitability. When delivering NMES at 100 Hz, MEPs became significantly elevated from those evoked before the stimulation at the 24th min, and there was a twofold increase in MEP amplitude after 40 min. NMES delivered at 10, 50, and 200 Hz did not significantly alter MEP amplitude. The amplitude of MEPs evoked in soleus and vastus medialis followed similar patterns as those evoked simultaneously in TA, but these changes were mostly not of statistical significance. There were no changes in the ratio of maximal H-reflex to maximal M-wave in TA or soleus. These experiments demonstrate a frequency-dependent effect of NMES on CS excitability for TA and show that, under the conditions of the present study, 100-Hz stimulation was more effective than 10, 50, and 200 Hz. This effect of NMES on CS excitability was strongest in the stimulated muscle and may be mediated primarily at a supraspinal level. These results contribute to a growing body of knowledge about how the afferent volley generated during NMES influences the CNS and have implications for identifying optimal NMES parameters to augment CS excitability for rehabilitation of dorsiflexion after CNS injury.", "pages": "11-20"}, {"volume": "176", "title": "Cortical motor neurophysiology of patients with schizophrenia: a study using transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "20202691", "authors": ["Soubasi, E", "Chroni, E", "Gourzis, P", "Zisis, A", "Beratis, S", "Papathanasopoulos, P"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "Trancranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for exploring physiological alterations of central motor control in a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. The present study aimed to assess the neurophysiological profile of muscle evoked responses to a standard TMS procedure in 51 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 51 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle were elicited by stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex with a circular coil. The hot spot was marked, and the resting motor threshold (RMTh), the stimulus intensity for maximum MEP (SI-max), the post-stimulus silent period of voluntary muscle activity, and MEP latency and amplitude were measured. The main findings were the significantly higher than normal values for RMTh and SI-max, which are both indices of neuronal excitability. In particular, patients who had ziprasidone in their therapeutic regimen demonstrated the highest SI-max for both hemispheres, and the highest RMTh for the left hemisphere, patients receiving olanzapine demonstrated the lowest RMTh for the left hemisphere, and those on quetiapine showed intermediate values. The silent period was longer in the patients than in the controls when a RMTh-related SI was used and did not differ between the two groups when a fixed SI was used. We concluded that the observed TMS changes could be interpreted as primary alterations of intracortical motor excitability followed by defects of cortical inhibition and should be attributed to schizophrenia, antipsychotic medication or the interaction between the two factors.", "pages": "11-20"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Rapid-onset central motor plasticity in multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "20194911", "authors": ["Zeller, D", "aufm Kampe, K", "Biller, A", "Stefan, K", "Gentner, R", "Sch\u00fctz, A", "Bartsch, A", "Bendszus, M", "Toyka, KV", "Rieckmann, P", "Classen, J"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To study rapid-onset central motor plasticity, and its relationship to motor impairment and CNS injury in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).", "pages": "11-20"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Design and construction of a low cost dsPIC controller based repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulator (rTMS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20192051", "authors": ["Burunkaya, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of medical systems", "abstract": "In this cross-sectional observational study, motor plasticity was examined neurophysiologically and behaviorally in 22 patients with moderately severe (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 2.5 [0-6]) stable MS and matched healthy controls.

Pulse width modulation and switching output of the control unit, which is necessary to control the rTMS device, were controlled in a more effective way. The other novelty is that developed system can be used for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes in future work provided by digital signal processing performance of dsPIC.
