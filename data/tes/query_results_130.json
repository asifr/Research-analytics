To investigate the specific contribution of these two functional pathways, two groups of neurologically healthy humans were tested using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In Experiment 1, participants received sham and active cathodal-inhibitory tDCS over the left occipital cortex, while, in control Experiment 2, participants received sham and active cathodal-inhibitory tDCS over the vertex, to exclude any unspecific effect of tDCS. After tDCS, participants performed a go/no-go task responding to happy or fearful target faces presented in the left visual field, while backwardly masked faces (emotionally congruent, incongruent, or neutral) were concurrently displayed in the right visual field. After both suppressing activity in the vertex (Experiment 2) and sham stimulation (Experiment 1 and 2) a reduction of reaction times was found for pairs of emotionally congruent stimuli. However, after suppressing the activity in the left occipital cortex, the congruency-dependent response facilitation disappeared, while a specific facilitative affect was evident when masked fearful faces were coupled with happy target faces. These results parallel the performances of hemianopic patients and suggest that when the occipital cortex is damaged or inhibited, and the visual processing for emotional faces is mainly dependent on the activation of the \"low road\" subcortical route, fearful faces represent the only visually processed stimuli capable of facilitating a behavioral response. This effect might reflect an adaptive mechanism implemented by the brain to quickly react to potential threats before their conscious identification.", "pages": "3-5"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of the visual cortex: a proof-of-concept study based on interictal electrophysiological abnormalities in migraine.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "2064729", "authors": ["Vigan\u00f2, A", "D'Elia, TS", "Sava, SL", "Auv\u00e9, M", "De Pasqua, V", "Colosimo, A", "Di Piero, V", "Schoenen, J", "Magis, D"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The journal of headache and pain", "abstract": "Preventive pharmacotherapy for migraine is not satisfactory because of the low efficacy/tolerability ratio of many available drugs. Novel and more efficient preventive strategies are therefore warranted. Abnormal excitability of cortical areas appears to play a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex, and is being tested in various medical indications. The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting, possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen. We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex, especially the visual cortex, is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive neurophysiological investigation mainly used to study the integrity of the primary motor cortex excitability and of the cortico-spinal tract. The development of paired-pulse and repetitive TMS (rTMS) paradigms has allowed investigators to explore the pathophysiology of depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases linked to brain excitability dysfunctions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has also therapeutic and rehabilitative capabilities since it is able to induce changes in the excitability of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal networks that may persist in time. However, the therapeutic effects of rTMS on major depression have been demonstrated by analyzing only the improvement of neuropsychological performance. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical excitability changes on 12 chronically-medicated depressed patients (test group) after rTMS treatment and to correlate neurophysiological findings to neuropsychological outcomes. In detail, we assessed different parameters of cortical excitability before and after active rTMS in the test group, then compared to those of 10 age-matched depressed patients (control group) who underwent sham rTMS. In line with previous studies, at baseline both groups exhibited a significant interhemispheric difference of motor cortex excitability. This neurophysiological imbalance was then reduced in the patients treated with active rTMS, resulting also in a clinical benefit as demonstrated by the improvement in neuropsychological test scores. On the contrary, after sham rTMS, the interhemispheric difference was still evident in the control group. The reported clinical benefits in the test group might be related to the plastic remodeling of synaptic connection induced by rTMS treatment.", "pages": "3-5"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "High-frequency TRNS reduces BOLD activity during visuomotor learning.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "21120924", "authors": ["Saiote, C", "Polan\u00eda, R", "Rosenberger, K", "Paulus, W", "Antal, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is marked by disturbances in brain functional connectivity. This connectivity is modulated by rhythmic oscillations of brain electrical activity, which enable coordinated functions across brain regions. Oscillatory activity plays a central role in regulating thinking and memory, mood, cerebral blood flow, and neurotransmitter levels, and restoration of normal oscillatory patterns is associated with effective treatment of MDD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a robust treatment for MDD, but the mechanism of action (MOA) of its benefits for mood disorders remains incompletely understood. Benefits of rTMS have been tied to enhanced neuroplasticity in specific brain pathways. We summarize here the evidence that rTMS entrains and resets thalamocortical oscillators, normalizes regulation and facilitates reemergence of intrinsic cerebral rhythms, and through this mechanism restores normal brain function. This entrainment and resetting may be a critical step in engendering neuroplastic changes and the antidepressant effects of rTMS. It may be possible to modify the method of rTMS administration to enhance this MOA and achieve better antidepressant effectiveness. We propose that rTMS can be administered: (1) synchronized to a patient's individual alpha frequency (IAF), or synchronized rTMS (sTMS); (2) as a low magnetic field strength sinusoidal waveform; and, (3) broadly to multiple brain areas simultaneously. We present here the theory and evidence indicating that these modifications could enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of MDD.", "pages": "3-5"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "A review of computational models of transcranial electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "21940440", "authors": ["Bai, S", "Loo, C", "Dokos, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Critical reviews in biomedical engineering", "abstract": "Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a chronic, severe form of schizophrenia, and is typically treatment resistant.
