In this study, we investigated how two modem antidepressant therapies, chronic treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and administration of an antidepressant belonging to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), paroxetine, affect the proliferative response of thymocytes and splenocytes stimulated in vitro with various mitogens. Paroxetine (10 mg/kg) and TMS (B = 1.2 T, f = 30 Hz, t = 330 s) were applied once daily for 12 consecutive days, while, if given jointly paroxetine was injected 30 min before TMS. The mitogens used were: concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). While either treatment applied alone had no effect on proliferative response, the joint application of paroxetine and TMS significantly depressed it. The literature data suggest that pulsed magnetic field may directly inhibit mitogen-activated lymphocyte proliferation, which is also inhibited by the presence of high level of serotonin. The present results suggest that both effects are additive, and because of that application of both treatments, whose effects alone are insufficient to prompt the reaction, possibly because adaptive changes during chronic treatment, results in a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Increased cortical excitability with longer duration of Parkinson's disease as evaluated by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12865507", "authors": ["Bhatia, M", "Johri, S", "Behari, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurology India", "abstract": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate the cortical excitability and central motor pathways in Parkinson's disease (PD) and correlate with severity and duration of disease. 19 cases of PD and 13 controls were enrolled.

The three forms of neuromodulation described in this paper-deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation-were chosen primarily for their demonstrated or potential clinical usefulness. Deep brain stimulation is a completely implanted technique for improving movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, by very focal electrical stimulation of the brain-a technique that employs well-established hardware (electrode and pulse generator/battery). Vagus nerve stimulation is similar to deep brain stimulation in being well-established (for the treatment of refractory epilepsy), completely implanted, and having hardware that can be considered standard at the present time. Vagus nerve stimulation differs from deep brain stimulation, however, in that afferent stimulation of the vagus nerve results in diffuse effects on many regions throughout the brain. Although use of deep brain stimulation for applications beyond movement disorders will no doubt involve placing the stimulating electrode(s) in regions other than the thalamus, subthalamus, or globus pallidus, the use of vagus nerve stimulation for applications beyond epilepsy-for example, depression and eating disorders-is unlikely to require altering the hardware significantly (although stimulation protocols may differ). Transcranial magnetic stimulation is an example of an external or non-implanted, intermittent (at least given the current state of the hardware) stimulation technique, the clinical value of which for neuromodulation and neuroprotection remains to be determined.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Computation of electric and magnetic stimulation in human head using the 3-D impedance method.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "12848358", "authors": ["Nadeem, M", "Thorlin, T", "Gandhi, OP", "Persson, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool for the electrical stimulation of neural tissue, including cerebral cortex, spinal roots, and cranial and peripheral nerves. TMS can be applied as single pulses of stimulation, pairs of stimuli separated by variable intervals to the same or different brain areas, or as trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies. Single stimuli can depolarise neurons and evoke measurable effects. Trains of stimuli (repetitive TMS) can modify excitability of the cerebral cortex at the stimulated site and also at remote areas along functional anatomical connections. TMS might provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders, be developed into clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic tests, and have therapeutic uses in various diseases.

The magnetic fields from a typical TMS coil of figure-eight type is modeled using the Biot-Savart law. The TMS coil is placed in a position used clinically for treatment of depression. Induced current densities and electric field distributions are calculated in the model using the impedance method. The calculations are made using driving currents and wave forms typical in the clinical setting. The obtained results are compared and contrasted with the corresponding ECT results. In the ECT case, a uniform current density is injected on one side of the head and extracted from the equal area on the opposite side of the head. The area of the injected currents corresponds to the electrode placement used in the clinic. The currents and electric fields, thus, produced within the model are computed using the same three-dimensional impedance method as used for the TMS case. The ECT calculations are made using currents and wave forms typical in the clinic. The electrical tissue properties are obtained from a 4-Cole-Cole model. The numerical results obtained are shown on a two-dimenaional cross section of the model.
