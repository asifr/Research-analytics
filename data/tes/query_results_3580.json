Reaction times to auditory stimuli were shorter than those to visual or somatosensory stimuli, and were inversely correlated with the stimulus intensity. The reaction time was longest to a transcranial (magnetic or electric) stimulus delivered over the contralateral motor cortex that was sufficiently strong to induce a motor evoked potential in the responding biceps. Conversely, reaction time was shortest to either subthreshold transcranial stimulation over the same scalp position or to transcranial stimulation over the ipsilateral motor cortex regardless of intensity. Suprathreshold transcranial stimulation to the motor cortex seems to transiently inhibit the neurons responsible for initiation of motor programs involving muscles in which motor evoked potentials have been induced, thereby prolonging the reaction time. On the other hand, a subthreshold stimulus either disinhibits or directly activates such neurons leading to a shorter reaction time. Transcallosal connections between the motor cortices may account for the short reaction time to ipsilateral transcranial stimulation.", "pages": "109-22"}, {"volume": "492", "title": "Magnetic facial nerve stimulation in normal subjects.

Clinical recovery was evaluated at 258-539, mean 410, days from the beginning of the palsy. With both techniques the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) could always be elicited on the healthy side, the mean latency being 4.7 ms with TMS and 3.7 ms with EES. In the acute phase, TMS elicited MEPs on the paralyzed side in 47% of the patients, and EES in 98%. The patients with TMS elicitable MEPs during the first 4 days of the palsy had significantly better recovery than those without response (p less than 0.05). The difference in recovery between patients with or without elicitable TMS responses on days 5-8 and 9-14 was not significant. In EES, the amplitude difference between the two sides within the first 4 days was not significantly (p greater than 0.05) different.

These effects were reported without gradual tapering of the opiate or the addition of other medications. To test the efficacy of one particular form of neuroelectric therapy (NET), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted comparing active NET and placebo NET in the treatment of withdrawal and stabilization of 18 opiate-dependent and 25 cocaine-dependent subjects. Scores on scales for measuring substance withdrawal and craving for each abused substance, as well as the multiple dimensions of mood, were compared for degree of difference across the 10 days of treatment. There was an overall completion rate of 88%, with both cocaine and opiate groups reporting a comfortable detoxification and substantial improvement over the course of a 12-day hospitalization. There was no significant difference between the active or placebo groups, suggesting that placebo was as effective as active NET in reducing drug withdrawal or craving during cocaine and opiate detoxification. However, all placebo patients received 0.2 mA of current, which may have provided a degree of active current.

In normal subjects magnetic stimulation produced a short latency facilitation of TA motor units but had little or no effect on SOL motor units. In the patients with spinal cord lesions magnetic stimulation also produced facilitation of TA but not SOL motor units; however, the mean latency of the TA facilitation was significantly longer (by about 14 ms) in the patient group. The F wave latencies were normal in all patients tested, suggesting that central rather than peripheral conduction was slowed. The duration of the period of increased firing probability (in TA motor units) was also significantly longer in the patients with spinal cord lesions. These changes may reflect the slowing of conduction and dispersal of conduction velocities in the corticospinal pathways as a consequence of the spinal cord lesion.

The cortical source of the paraesthesias was sought by comparing their incidence with that of muscle responses to focal MC stimulation with either a figure 8 MC or with edge stimulation of a tilted round MC in 4 susceptible subjects. In all 4, paraesthesias were best felt with MC stimulation either at, or anterior to sites yielding movement, implying an initial source in precentral gyrus (and possible premotor cortex), rather than parietal cortex. In the two subjects exhibiting the strongest paraesthesias, the threshold for the paraesthesias was less than that for movement in the relaxed arm. The optimal site of the paraesthesias within the hand was usually in the digits, but differed among subjects. Motor responses and paraesthesias following a given stimulus occurred at different sites in the hand, implying that excitation of differing sets of motor cortical neurons subserved sensory and motor responses. In only one subject were the paraesthesias sufficiently reproducible to warrant interacting electrical digital and transcranial MC pulses. The data suggested that central processing of the response to the MC pulse is slowed by an antecedent digital stimulus, but the delay for perception of each type of stimulus does not greatly differ. The central sense of movement (Amassian et al., 1989a) elicited by MC stimulation of motor cortex is compared with the paraesthesias. Both are attributed to brief, high frequency discharge by motor cortical neurons accessing the perceptual system more readily than after excitation of post-central gyrus, which requires prolonged repetitive stimulation (Libet et al., 1964). Given also the normal pattern of muscle responses in the 4 subjects, their paraesthesias are best explained by a heightened sensitivity of the perceptual system to the motor cortical response to MC stimulation.", "pages": "109-22"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "[Electrophysiologic evaluation of the facial nerve in patients with acoustic neuromas.

The clinical application of extratemporal stimulation distal to the stylomastoid foramen is limited in these cases because of the more proximal site of the lesion. Transcranial magnetic coil stimulation (MCS) is a non-invasive means by which the facial nerve is stimulated at the level of the motor cortex or the brain stem before it enters the internal auditory canal. Topographically such an assessment may have more diagnostic relevance than other forms of electrical stimulation in acoustic neuroma patients. To test this theory the facial nerves of 20 patients with an acoustic neuroma were stimulated using ENOG and MCS before and 1 week after operation. Stimulation parameters were comparable and included threshold, double-threshold and supra-threshold levels of stimulation while compound action potential amplitudes and early and late response latencies were monitored. All the patients had clinically normal facial nerve function preoperatively. Using ENOG 65% of the patients showed amplitude reduction on the tumour side, whereas 70% of these patients had a reduction of amplitude to MCS. Combining both techniques, 88% of the patients had a significant amplitude reduction on the neuroma side. Comparison of the preoperative threshold measurements of both techniques showed that there was a significantly higher incidence of detection of lesions on the diseased side in neuromas larger than 2 cm by the use of MCS.", "pages": "109-22"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Electrical and magnetic spinal and cortical stimulation in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "5360915", "authors": ["Berardelli, A"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Current opinion in neurology and neurosurgery", "abstract": "With the technique of transcranial and spinal electrical and magnetic stimulation it is possible to study the function of motor pathways in normal subjects.
