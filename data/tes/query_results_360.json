However, there has been little translation of these findings into practical TMS research. This study uses the International 10-20 EEG electrode placement system to position a standard figure-of-eight TMS coil over 13 commonly adopted targets. Using a finite element method and an anatomically detailed and realistic head model, this study provides the first pictorial and numerical atlas of TMS-induced electric fields for a range of coil positions. The results highlight the importance of subject-specific gyral folding patterns and of local thickness of subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our modelling shows that high electric fields occur primarily on the peaks of those gyri which have only a thin layer of CSF above them. These findings have important implications for inter-individual generalizability of the TMS-induced electric field. We propose that, in order to determine with accuracy the site of stimulation for an individual subject, it is necessary to solve the electric field distribution using subject-specific anatomy obtained from a high-resolution imaging modality such as MRI.", "pages": "671-81"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic electro-stimulation with alternate action on brain hemispheres in the correction of cerebral disturbances in children with diabetes mellitus type 1].", "keywords": [], "issue": "3 Pt 1", "pmid": "22677753", "authors": ["Filina, NIu", "Bolotova, NV", "Ra\u012dgorodski\u012d, IuM", "Nikolaeva, NV"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

The method includes the combined action of magnetic field pulses and series of electric impulses; magnetic and electric stimulation were performed synchronously - at first, on one brain hemisphere, then on another hemisphere with alternation frequency 9.5-10.5 Hz. A comparison group consisted of 44 patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 who received physiotherapeutic treatment as a combination of transcranial magnetic therapy and electro-stimulation with simultaneous action on both brain hemispheres. Treatment duration was 10 sessions. Treatment efficacy was assessed by the decrease in frequency and intensity of complaints, improvement of patient's health status measured (a scale for assessment of activity, health perception and mood) and improvement of the status of the autonomic nervous system (Vein's questionnaire), mental sphere (the Luscher color test) and cognitive traits (The Concentrated Attention Test of the Toulouse-Pierron Factorial Battery). The status of the autonomic nervous system was evaluated before and after the treatment using cardiointervalography. Brain bioelectrical activity was assessed using encephalography. Significant reduction of autonomic, psychoemotional and cognitive disturbances, normalization of brain bioelectrical activity due to the \u03b1-rhythm organization and arrhythmia removal were identified in the main group after the treatment. No adverse effects of this physiotherapeutic treatment was found.", "pages": "671-81"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "[Treatment of chronic pain: transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex?].", "keywords": [], "issue": "339", "pmid": "22675823", "authors": ["Benninger, D", "Kuntzer, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Revue m\u00e9dicale suisse", "abstract": "Chronic pain refractory to medical therapy poses a therapeutic challenge.

The aim of the study was to examine the changes in corticomotor excitability in response to different forms of ES applied to the wrist extensors. Healthy adults and people with stroke completed three separate test sessions. In each session, 60 wrist extensor contractions were elicited by one of the three interventions: (1) voluntary isometric muscle activation, (2) automated ES, or (3) electromyography-triggered ES. Motor evoked potentials were significantly increased after the voluntary contraction and electromyography-triggered ES interventions, but not after automated ES, in healthy participants. There was no significant change in motor evoked potential amplitude after any of the interventions in the participants with chronic stroke. Using the ES parameters of this study, voluntary drive was required to induce change in corticomotor excitability in the healthy participants. The stimulation intensity and duration parameters used did not induce any immediate changes in corticomotor excitability in the participants with stroke. The authors conclude that combining voluntary activation with ES may enhance the efficacy of stimulation in healthy adults. Repeated applications or longer durations of stimulation may be necessary to alter neuronal excitability in a stroke population.", "pages": "671-81"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Functional plasticity of the motor cortical structures demonstrated by navigated TMS in two patients with epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22659020", "authors": ["M\u00e4kel\u00e4, JP", "Vitikainen, AM", "Lioumis, P", "Paetau, R", "Ahtola, E", "Kuusela, L", "Valanne, L", "Blomstedt, G", "Gaily, E"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "To establish a novel approach for fiber tracking based on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) mapping of the primary motor cortex and to propose a new algorithm for determination of an individualized fractional anisotropy value for reliable and objective fiber tracking.", "pages": "671-81"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of major depressive disorder: a summary of preclinical, clinical and translational findings.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "22651961", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Ferrucci, R", "Fregni, F", "Boggio, PS", "Priori, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry", "abstract": "50 patients (22 females, 28 males, median age 58 years (20-80)) with brain tumors compromising the primary motor cortex and the corticospinal tract underwent preoperative MR imaging and nTMS mapping.
