High-density electroencephalography was used to define the spatial diffusion of tDCS after effects. Ten healthy subjects performed a finger tapping task with the right hand before and after three separate sessions of 20 minutes of Sham, AtDCS or CtDCS over left primary motor cortex (M1). During movement, we found an increment of low alpha band Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in bilateral central, frontal areas and in the left inferior parietal region, as well as an increment of beta ERD in fronto-central and parieto-occipital regions, after AtDCs compared to Sham and CtDCS. In the rest pre-movement period, after Sham as well as AtDCS, we documented an increment of low alpha band power over the course of pre- and post-stimulation recording sessions, localized in the sensorimotor and parieto-occipital regions. On the contrary, after CtDCS no increment of low alpha power was found. Finally beta band coherence among signals from left sensorimotor cortex and activity of bilateral parietal, occipital and right frontal regions was higher after AtDCS compared with Sham condition. Similarly, theta coherence with parietal and frontal regions was enhanced after AtDCS. We hypothesize that the local modulation of membrane polarization, as well as long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1, could result in changes of both local band power and functional architecture of the motor network.

Individuals with this condition may require surgical correction of a secondary scoliosis. Motor evoked potentials were recorded using transcranial electrical stimulation in four such individuals undergoing surgery. All the patients were nonambulatory and in wheelchairs. Motor evoked potentials were recordable in both upper and lower limb muscles, with similar stimulation parameters to control subjects undergoing surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. The amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials were similar to those in control subjects, although the latencies were shorter reflective of the smaller stature of the spinal muscular atrophy patients. The relative preservation of the motor evoked potentials despite the patients' poor voluntary motor control suggests that there is a selective preservation of the motor neurons mediating the motor evoked potential in spinal muscular atrophy and a maintenance of the conduction velocities of the corticospinal tract.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Descending spinal cord evoked potentials in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: Characteristic waveform changes seen at the lesion site.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23890513", "authors": ["Tadokoro, N", "Tani, T", "Ikeuchi, M", "Takemasa, R", "Kida, K", "Ikemoto, T", "Ushida, T", "Taniguchi, S", "Kimura, J"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Baclofen is a GABAB receptor agonist commonly used to relief spasticity related to motor disorders. The effects of baclofen on voluntary motor output are limited and not yet understood. Using noninvasive transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation techniques, we examined electrophysiological measures probably involving GABAB (long-interval intracortical inhibition and the cortical silent period) and GABAA (short-interval intracortical inhibition) receptors, which are inhibitory effects mediated by subcortical and cortical mechanisms. We demonstrate increased active long-interval intracortical inhibition and prolonged cortical silent period during voluntary activity of an intrinsic finger muscle in humans with chronic incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) compared with age-matched controls, whereas resting long-interval intracortical inhibition was unchanged. However, long-term (~6 years) use of baclofen decreased active long-interval intracortical inhibition to similar levels as controls but did not affect the duration of the cortical silent period. We found a correlation between signs of spasticity and long-interval intracortical inhibition in patients with SCI. Short-interval intracortical inhibition was decreased during voluntary contraction compared with rest but there was no effect of SCI or baclofen use. Together, these results demonstrate that baclofen selectively maintains use-dependent modulation of largely subcortical but not cortical GABAB neuronal pathways after human SCI. Thus, cortical GABA(B) circuits may be less sensitive to baclofen than spinal GABAB circuits. This may contribute to the limited effects of baclofen on voluntary motor output in subjects with motor disorders affected by spasticity.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Efficacy of intraoperative monitoring of transcranial electrical stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials and spontaneous electromyography activity to identify acute-versus delayed-onset C-5 nerve root palsy during cervical spine surgery: clinical article.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "23889183", "authors": ["Bhalodia, VM", "Schwartz, DM", "Sestokas, AK", "Bloomgarden, G", "Arkins, T", "Tomak, P", "Gorelick, J", "Wijesekera, S", "Beiner, J", "Goodrich, I"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery. Spine", "abstract": "Plasticity of synaptic connections in the primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to play an essential role in learning and memory. Human and animal studies have shown that motor learning results in long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity processes, namely potentiation of M1 and a temporary occlusion of additional LTP-like plasticity. Moreover, biochemical processes essential for LTP are also crucial for certain types of motor learning and memory. Thus, it has been speculated that the occlusion of LTP-like plasticity after learning, indicative of how much LTP was used to learn, is essential for retention. Here we provide supporting evidence of it in humans. Induction of LTP-like plasticity can be abolished using a depotentiation protocol (DePo) consisting of brief continuous theta burst stimulation. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess whether application of DePo over M1 after motor learning affected (1) occlusion of LTP-like plasticity and (2) retention of motor skill learning. We found that the magnitude of motor memory retention is proportional to the magnitude of occlusion of LTP-like plasticity. Moreover, DePo stimulation over M1, but not over a control site, reversed the occlusion of LTP-like plasticity induced by motor learning and disrupted skill retention relative to control subjects. Altogether, these results provide evidence of a link between occlusion of LTP-like plasticity and retention and that this measure could be used as a biomarker to predict retention. Importantly, attempts to reverse the occlusion of LTP-like plasticity after motor learning comes with the cost of reducing retention of motor learning.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Analgesic effect of TES therapy in the early postoperative period in patients who underwent tonsillectomy].", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "23887374", "authors": ["Sem\u00ebnov, FV", "Kade, AKh", "Banashek-Meshchiarkova, TV", "Vartanian, MS"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Vestnik otorinolaringologii", "abstract": "To characterize waveform changes of descending spinal cord evoked potentials (D-SCEPs) seen in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Effects of transcranial focal electrical stimulation alone and associated with a sub-effective dose of diazepam on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and subsequent neuronal damage in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "23886585", "authors": ["Besio, W", "Cuellar-Herrera, M", "Luna-Munguia, H", "Orozco-Su\u00e1rez, S", "Rocha, L"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "Intraoperative D-SCEP recording from serial intervertebral discs after transcranial electrical stimulation in 19 CSM patients with cord compression at a single level.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "33", "title": "[Fifteen cases of essential tremor treated by electroacupuncture combined with transcranial repeated stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "23885631", "authors": ["Wang, YM", "Sun, ZR", "Wu, H"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion", "abstract": "Compared to the baseline (100%) obtained one level rostrally, the D-SCEP recorded at the compression site showed a significantly (p<0.001) decreased amplitude (48%) and area (48%) of negative peak and increased amplitude (171%) and area (279%) of initial-positive peak.
