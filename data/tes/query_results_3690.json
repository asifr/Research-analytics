Both electrical (with the anode overlying the face area of the motor cortex) and magnetic TCS (with the coil at the vertex) excite the upper motoneurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus, evoking motor potentials (C-MEPs) in the jaw-closing and suprahyoid muscles, but only during voluntary contraction. At least 30% of jaw-closing motoneurons are reached by direct fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are mainly crossed. Suprahyoid motoneurons are also reached by fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are probably bilateral. In the masseter, electrical TCS also evokes an ipsilateral motor response (R-MEP), followed by a later wave (U), and bilateral inhibitory periods. The R-MEP is secondary to excitation of the motor trigeminal root; the U wave probably results from the simultaneous excitation of Ia afferents in the root and ipsilaterally projecting corticofugal fibres; the inhibitory periods are largely due to activation of exteroceptive afferents in the root. Magnetic TCS, avoiding spread of current to the trigeminal root, evokes C-MEPs but not R-MEPs or U waves. The masseter inhibitory period after magnetic TCS may be due to excitation of corticofugal inhibitory fibres and to mechanical activation of Golgi tendon organs.", "pages": "1333-50"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Investigation of facial motor pathways by electrical and magnetic stimulation: sites and mechanisms of excitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "2795040", "authors": ["R\u00f6sler, KM", "Hess, CW", "Schmid, UD"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "A refined technique is described for non invasive examination of the facial motor pathways by stimulation of the extra- and intracranial segment of the facial nerve and the facial motor cortex. Surface recordings from the nasalis muscle rather than from the orbicularis oris muscle were used, since the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from this muscle showed a more clearly defined onset. Electrical extracranial stimulation of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid fossa in 14 healthy subjects yielded a mean distal motor latency of 3.7 ms (SD 0.46), comparable with reported latencies to the orbicularis oris muscle. Using a magnetic stimulator, transcranial stimulation of the facial nerve was performed. The mechanism of transcranial magnetic facial nerve stimulation was studied using recordings on 12 patients who had facial nerve lesions at different locations, and with intraoperative direct measurements in four patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery. The actual site of stimulation could be localised to the proximal part of the facial canal, and a mean \"transosseal conduction time\" of 1.2 ms (SD 0.18) was calculated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) played an important role in mediating the magnetically induced stimulating currents. Finally, with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial motor cortex, clearly discernible CMAPs could be produced when voluntary activation of several facial muscles was used to facilitate the responses. From this, a central motor conduction time of 5.1 ms was calculated (SD 0.60, 6 subjects).", "pages": "1333-50"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Motor evoked potential monitoring during upper cervical spine surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "13990734", "authors": ["Kitagawa, H", "Itoh, T", "Takano, H", "Takakuwa, K", "Yamamoto, N", "Yamada, H", "Tsuji, H"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Motor evoked potential (MEP) produced by transcranial electrical stimulation was recorded from an epidural electrode in 20 consecutive patients during upper cervical spine surgery.

One patient had complete loss of MEP and was left a respiratory quadriplegic. In 2 cases, MEP amplitudes increased after tumor extirpation and remarkable remissions were observed. The MEP correlated with clinical outcomes and was a useful monitoring technique for upper cervical spine surgery, free of complication. In cat experiments designed to analyze conducting pathways, the maximal amplitude of the initial spike of MEP existed in the ventromedial spinal cord, which contains the extrapyramidal tracts.

Transcranial magnetoelectrical stimulation of the motor cortex has proved to be the most useful method. However this is not true for transcutaneous stimulation of lumbar roots. In healthy subjects electrical root stimuli given at T12/L1 produced compound muscle responses in Tibialis anterior muscles in all 18 trials. However, magnetoelectrical stimulation (100% stimulus strength) evoked responses in only 8 (Novametrix) and 12 out of 18 trials (Cadwell). Stimulation with the Digitimer D190 was less effective. Additionally compound responses after electrical root excitation were more consistent and they had a higher amplitude compared with magnetoelectrical stimulation. Regarding to these results electrical lumbar root stimulation is thought to be the advantageous method despite it is slightly more uncomfortable. Therefore normal results of CMCT to Tibialis anterior (shown in Table 1) are measured after magnetoelectrical transcranial (Digitimer D190) and transcutaneous electrical stimulation of spinal nerve roots. If the peripheral motor conduction is delayed normal values have to be adapted since CMCT is thought to involve a proximal anterior root segment. An intraspinal motor conduction time can be calculated from CMCT to upper and lower extremities.", "pages": "1333-50"}, {"volume": "495", "title": "Single fibre motor evoked potentials to brain, spinal roots and nerve stimulation.

The magnetic 'central motor jitter' (range 94-1024 microsecond) was much larger than the electric one (range 55-280 microsecond), which was in the order of jitter calculated on H-reflex studies; moreover, the former was organized in a bi- or trimodal distribution. On the contrary, no significant differences were observed between the two modalities when the jitter to nerve stimulation was taken into account.

The mean conduction velocity of the early wave was 66, SD 2.5 m/s. At high stimulus intensity this wave was followed by later and smaller waves, which travel at the same speed as the initial potential. The recovery cycle of the descending volley was studied by delivering paired cortical stimuli at time intervals ranging from 0.5 to 10 ms. The early wave evoked by the test stimulus recovered to about 50% at a 1 ms interval and to 100% at a 3.5 ms interval. The later waves could not be tested at short time intervals but with time intervals longer than 3.5 ms they recovered to 100%.
