It is possible to use non-invasive methods of brain stimulation in humans (transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation) to study and even manipulate these processes. Initial studies are now underway to test whether modification of synaptic plasticity by neurostimulation can improve the recovery of motor function in patients after stroke.", "pages": "153-7"}, {"volume": "73", "title": "Role of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring in lumbosacral spine fusion and instrumentation: a retrospective study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19371866", "authors": ["Alemo, S", "Sayadipour, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "abstract": "This study was carried out to determine the efficacy of IONM in detecting iatrogenic neural injury during pedicle screw insertion, in comparison to the efficacy of computerized tomography (CT) and direct visual inspection of adjacent nerve roots.", "pages": "153-7"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Impact of pulse duration in single pulse TMS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "16033688", "authors": ["Rothkegel, H", "Sommer, M", "Paulus, W", "Lang, N"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We reviewed the records of 86 patients, who had had 414 titanium pedicle screws inserted for posterior lumbar instrumentation.
