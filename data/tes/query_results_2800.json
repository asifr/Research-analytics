Since there was no effect on spinal H-reflexes, this is consistent with the idea that some of the suppression occurs because of an effect on the motor cortex itself. The lack of any conditioning effect on MEPs evoked in actively contracting muscle is not readily consistent with the idea that rTMS depresses transmission in synaptic connections to pyramidal cells activated by the test TMS pulse. An alternative explanation is that rTMS reduces the excitability of cortical neurones in relaxed subjects, so that responses to a given input are smaller than before conditioning.
