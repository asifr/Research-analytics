This study compared the field distribution of two H-coil versions, termed H1 and H2, and of a standard figure-of-eight coil. Three-dimensional electrical field distributions of the H1 and H2-coils, designed for effective stimulation of prefrontal regions, and of a standard figure-8 coil, were measured in a head model filled with physiologic saline solution. With stimulator output at 120% of the hand motor threshold, suprathreshold field is induced by the H1-coil at lateral and medial frontal regions at depths of up to 4 to 5 cm, and by the H2-coil at medial prefrontal regions up to 2 to 3 cm, and at lateral frontal regions up to 5 to 6 cm. The figure-8 coil induced suprathreshold field focally under the coil's central segment, at depths of up to 1.5 cm. The ability of the H-coils to stimulate effectively deeper neuronal structures is obtained at the cost of a wider electrical field distribution in the brain. However, the H-coils enable simultaneous stimulation of several brain regions, whereas the depth penetration in each region can be controlled either by adjusting the stimulator output, and/or by varying the distance between various coil elements and the skull.", "pages": "31-8"}, {"volume": "180", "title": "Effects of 5 Hz subthreshold magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex on fast finger movements in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17265042", "authors": ["Agostino, R", "Iezzi, E", "Dinapoli, L", "Gilio, F", "Conte, A", "Mari, F", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Both groups performed 60 rapid abductions of the right index finger before and after rTMS. The kinematic variables measured were amplitude, duration, peak velocity and peak acceleration. We also evaluated RMT and motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude before, 5 and 30 min after rTMS.

In our study, 5 Hz rTMS failed to improve either the motor performance or the motor learning of a rapid index-finger abduction despite the increase in cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex. Since motor behaviour engages a distributed cortical and subcortical neuronal network, excitatory conditioning of the primary motor cortex is probably not sufficient to influence the behavioural output.", "pages": "31-8"}, {"volume": "180", "title": "Induction of cortical plastic changes in wrist muscles by paired associative stimulation in healthy subjects and post-stroke patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17265041", "authors": ["Castel-Lacanal, E", "Gerdelat-Mas, A", "Marque, P", "Loubinoux, I", "Simonetta-Moreau, M"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "It has been shown on hand muscles in normal subjects that paired associative stimulation (PAS) combining peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) induces lasting changes in cortical motor excitability (Stefan et al., Brain 123 (Pt3):572-584, 2000). Because the motor recovery of distal upper limb and particularly wrist extension in post-stroke patients is one of the major rehabilitation challenge, we investigate here the effect of one session of paired associative stimulation on the excitability of the corticospinal projection to extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle (motor evoked potential size) before and after PAS in 17 healthy subjects and in two patients 5 months after stroke. The time course, the topographical specificity, changes in rest motor threshold (RMT), short intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation (SICI and ICF), the respective role of cutaneous and muscular afferents and the effect of a prolonged peripheral stimulation alone were also studied in normal subjects. Using a protocol derived from that of Ridding et al. J Physiol 537:623-631 (2001), PAS was able to induce lasting changes in the excitability of corticospinal projection to wrist muscles in healthy subjects and in the two post-stroke patients studied. Electrophysiological features of these plastic changes were similar to those previously observed in hand muscles: rapid evolution, 30-60 min duration, reversibility, relative topographical specificity and associative dependence suggesting an LTP-like mechanism. A contribution of cutaneous afferents in inducing PAS effects was also demonstrated. The decrease in ECR RMT after PAS observed in patients and in healthy subjects was an unexpected result because it has not been previously reported in the hand muscles of healthy subjects. However, it has been observed in dystonic patients (Quartarone et al., Brain 126:2586-2596, 2003). This suggests that other mechanisms like changes in membrane excitability could be involved in ECR facilitation after PAS. Further studies performed on patients using daily repeated PAS protocols and showing a functional improvement in hand motor function will be necessary to confirm that this technique could be relevant in motor rehabilitation, at least for some selected patients.", "pages": "31-8"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Excitation threshold of the motor cortex estimated with transcranial magnetic stimulation electroencephalography.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17259853", "authors": ["Komssi, S", "Savolainen, P", "Heiskala, J", "K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, S"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "The excitation threshold of the human motor cortex was estimated on the basis of electroencephalographic responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation.

The low-frequency (1 Hz or less) rTMS is likely to play a particular role in its mechanism of action with different effects in comparison with high-frequency (>1 Hz) rTMS. There is limited information regarding the effect of low-frequency rTMS on spatial memory. In our study, each male Wistar rat was daily given 300 stimuli (1.0 T, 200 micros) at a rate of 0.5 Hz or sham stimulation. We investigated the effects of chronic and acute rTMS on reference/working memory process in Morris water maze test with the hypothesis that the effect would differ by chronic or acute condition. Chronic low-frequency rTMS impaired the retrieval of spatial short- and long-term spatial reference memory but not acquisition process and working memory, whereas acute low-frequency rTMS predominantly induced no deficits in acquisition or short-term spatial reference memory as well as working memory except for long-term reference memory. In summary, chronic 0.5 Hz rTMS disrupts spatial short- and long-term reference memory function, but acute rTMS differently affects reference memory. Chronic low-frequency rTMS may be used to modulate reference memory. Treatment protocols using low-frequency rTMS in neurological and psychiatric disorders need to take into account the potential effect of chronic low-frequency rTMS on memory and other cognitive functions.", "pages": "31-8"}, {"volume": "415", "title": "High-frequency rTMS of the motor cortex does not influence the nociceptive flexion reflex but increases the unpleasantness of electrically induced pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17258394", "authors": ["Mylius, V", "Reis, J", "Knaack, A", "Haag, A", "Oertel, WH", "Rosenow, F", "Schepelmann, K"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether a 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the motor cortex, using a stimulus paradigm employed for pain control in chronic pain, affects acute electrically induced pain. We investigated whether rTMS modulates the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) in addition to subjective pain perception. Pain threshold, NFR threshold, supra-threshold NFR response, and the concomitant pain intensity and pain unpleasantness visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were compared before and after 20 min of rTMS. Effects of 20 trains of 5 s' duration (55 s intertrain interval) of 10-Hz rTMS at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT) applied over the dominant motor cortex were compared to sham rTMS in 12 healthy volunteers. Supra-threshold NFR stimulation significantly increased pain unpleasantness VAS scores with real rTMS compared to sham rTMS (F(1,10)=6.91; P=0.025). There was no significant effect of 10-Hz rTMS on the subjective pain threshold or on the NFR, neither at threshold nor at supra-threshold noxious stimulation. The rTMS paradigm used to control chronic pain is not suitable for controlling Adelta fiber-mediated acute experimentally induced pain since the effects on pain perception were only marginal, with an increase in the VAS unpleasantness scores but with no effect on the NFR. The increased activity of cortico-thalamic projections might modulate the perception of Adelta fiber-mediated pain within the lateral pain pathway. The type of fiber that is stimulated and neuroplastic changes in chronic pain and are thought to be critical for rTMS to have an effect.", "pages": "31-8"}, {"volume": "83", "title": "Usefulness of transcranial motor evoked potentials during thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17257969", "authors": ["Kawanishi, Y", "Munakata, H", "Matsumori, M", "Tanaka, H", "Yamashita, T", "Nakagiri, K", "Okada, K", "Okita, Y"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of myogenic transcranial motor evoked potentials (tc-MEPs) for spinal cord ischemia in the repair of descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.", "pages": "31-8"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Triple-stimulation technique in multifocal neuropathy with conduction block.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17253636", "authors": ["Deroide, N", "Uzenot, D", "Verschueren, A", "Azulay, JP", "Pouget, J", "Attarian, S"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Intraoperative tc-MEPs was used in 72 patients who underwent the repair of descending thoracic (n = 24) or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (n = 49) classed as Crawford I in 10 patients, II in 12, III in 23, and IV in 3.
