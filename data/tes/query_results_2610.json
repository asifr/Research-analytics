Non-conditioned and subthreshold conditioned (2 ms interstimulus interval) responses were recorded in the flexor and extensor carpi radialis muscles (FCR and ECR) of the more impaired (non-dominant) limb. Stimuli were delivered while the wrist joint was positioned statically at various joint angles as well as during different phases of passive movement of the wrist joint (90 degrees amplitude, 0.2 Hz). The FCR and ECR muscles remained relaxed during all stimulation. In both groups, responses in the static condition were larger when the target muscle was in a shortened position. Responses were also facilitated in the muscle shortening phases of passive movement. In both static and dynamic conditions, the extent of modulations in response amplitude was significantly reduced in the patient group. The level of intracortical inhibition (ICI) was also significantly less in the Parkinson's disease patients in static conditions. During passive movement, control subjects demonstrated a clear reduction in ICI compared with the static trials; however, the level of ICI was unchanged in the Parkinson's disease group in the dynamic condition. The results suggest an abnormal influence of afference on corticomotor excitability in Parkinson's disease. This may be related to abnormal sensory input, a defective integrative unit or an inappropriate motor response.", "pages": "560-2"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Noninvasive in vivo assessment of cholinergic cortical circuits in AD using transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10541749", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Oliviero, A", "Tonali, PA", "Marra, C", "Daniele, A", "Profice, P", "Saturno, E", "Pilato, F", "Masullo, C", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Localized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to disrupt visuospatial perception in the near and far space of six healthy volunteer subjects. In addition to the baseline condition, they were stimulated over the right posterior parietal cortex, the right or left dorsal occipital cortex or the right ventral occipital cortex, during the brief presentation of a transected horizontal line. Subjects had to indicate whether the part of the line to the left or right of the transection appeared longer. The stimulus display was back-projected on a screen at a viewing distance of either 50 or 150 cm (\"near\" and \"far\" space, respectively). Reaction times and choices were measured. In a forced-choice paradigm, subjects showed \"pseudoneglect\", the natural tendency of neurologically intact subjects to perceive the left side of a centrally transected line as slightly longer than the right. These errors occurred more for lines in near space than for lines in far space. Magnetic stimulation of the right posterior parietal cortex or the right ventral occipital lobe selectively induced a significant shift to the right in the perceived midpoint for near- and far-space lines, respectively. The results reproduced in normal subjects the dissociation between neglect in near and far space that has been described in patients with different right-hemisphere lesions. This dissociation supports the contention that there is a dorsal/near space-ventral/far space segregation of processing in the visual system which reflects the behavioural goals of the two putative visual streams.", "pages": "560-2"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Handedness and language cerebral lateralization.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4-5", "pmid": "9051592", "authors": ["Khedr, EM", "Hamed, E", "Said, A", "Basahi, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "European journal of applied physiology", "abstract": "Seventeen patients affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) underwent two transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies separated by an interval of 12 months, in order to monitor possible changes in motor cortex excitability.

Interhemispheric inhibition can be measured by applying a conditioning stimulus to the motor cortex resulting in inhibition of the contralateral motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation can also be used to demonstrate ipsilateral cortico-cortical inhibition in the motor cortex. At least two different ipsilateral cortico-cortical inhibitory processes have been identified: short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition. However, the relationship between interhemispheric inhibition and ipsilateral cortico-cortical inhibition remains unclear. This study examined the relationship between interhemispheric inhibition, short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition. First, the effect of test stimulus intensity on each inhibitory process was studied. Second, the effects of interhemispheric inhibition on short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition on interhemispheric inhibition were examined. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle in 11 right-handed healthy volunteers. For interhemispheric inhibition, conditioning stimuli were applied to the right motor cortex and test stimuli to the left motor cortex. For short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition, both conditioning stimuli and test stimuli were applied to the left motor cortex. With increasing test stimulus intensities, long interval intracortical inhibition and interhemispheric inhibition decreased, while short interval intracortical inhibition increased. Moreover, short interval intracortical inhibition was significantly reduced in the presence of interhemispheric inhibition. Interhemispheric inhibition was significantly reduced in the presence of long interval intracortical inhibition when matched for test motor evoked potential amplitude but the difference was not significant when matched for test pulse intensity. These findings suggest that both interhemispheric inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition are predominately mediated by low threshold cortical neurons and may share common inhibitory mechanisms. In contrast, the mechanisms mediating short interval intracortical inhibition are probably different from those mediating long interval intracortical inhibition and interhemispheric inhibition although these systems appear to interact.", "pages": "560-2"}, {"volume": "508", "title": "A cervical propriospinal system in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10712469", "authors": ["Pierrot-Deseilligny, E", "Marchand-Pauvert, V"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "abstract": "A recently devised test of motor cortex excitability (short latency afferent inhibition) was shown to be sensitive to the blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in healthy subjects.
