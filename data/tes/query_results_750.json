We then characterize the ethical problems that affect the practice of cosmetic neurology, including safety, character, justice, and autonomy, and discuss how these problems may apply to the use of noninvasive brain stimulation for self-enhancement.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Evidence for the specificity of intracortical inhibitory dysfunction in asymptomatic concussed athletes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15452285", "authors": ["Tremblay, S", "de Beaumont, L", "Lassonde, M", "Th\u00e9oret, H"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "abstract": "Sports concussions affect thousands of individuals every year and are a major public health concern. Still, little is known about the long-term and cumulative effects of concussions on brain neurophysiology. The principal objective of this study was to investigate the long-lasting effects of multiple sports concussions on sensorimotor integration and somatosensory processing in a sample of 12 concussed athletes and 14 non-concussed athletes of similar age (mean, 23 years) and education (mean, 16 years). Right median nerve stimulation was paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left primary motor cortex to investigate sensorimotor integration with short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long latency afferent inhibition (LAI) at five interstimulus intervals (18, 20, 22, 100, 200 msec). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded from the left centro-parietal region. We also investigated primary motor cortex inhibitory mechanisms with three TMS protocols: cortical silent period, long interval intracortical inhibition, and short interval intracortical inhibition. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. No differences were observed between groups for SAI, LAI, and SEP. However, cortical silent period duration was prolonged and long interval intracortical inhibition was enhanced in the concussed group. These findings suggest that multiple sports concussions lead to specific, long-term neurophysiological dysfunctions of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms in primary motor cortex while somatosensory processing and sensorimotor integration are spared. This study provides additional evidence for the presence of specific and stable alterations of GABA(B) receptor activity in primary motor cortex that may be of clinical value for prognosis and diagnosis.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Transcranial electric motor evoked potential monitoring during spine surgery: is it safe?", "keywords": [], "issue": "13", "pmid": "19925194", "authors": ["Schwartz, DM", "Sestokas, AK", "Dormans, JP", "Vaccaro, AR", "Hilibrand, AS", "Flynn, JM", "Li, PM", "Shah, SA", "Welch, W", "Drummond, DS", "Albert, TJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Retrospective review.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "491", "title": "A rat model for measuring the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation using fMRI.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "7841814", "authors": ["Takano, Y", "Yokawa, T", "Masuda, A", "Niimi, J", "Tanaka, S", "Hironaka, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "To report on the safety of repetitive transcranial electric stimulation (RTES) for eliciting motor-evoked potentials during spine surgery.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Mood and cognitive effects of transcranial direct current stimulation in post-stroke depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "8614521", "authors": ["Bueno, VF", "Brunoni, AR", "Boggio, PS", "Bensenor, IM", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neurocase", "abstract": "Theoretical concerns over the safety of RTES have hindered broader acceptance of transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials (tceMEP), despite successful implementation of spinal cord monitoring with tceMEPs in many large spine centers, as well as their apparent superiority over mixed-nerve somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) for detection of spinal cord injury.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary motor cortex during fMRI.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8684201", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Polania, R", "Schmidt-Samoa, C", "Dechent, P", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "The records of 18,862 consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria and underwent spine surgery with tceMEP monitoring were reviewed for RTES-related complications.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation of the prefrontal cortex modulates working memory performance: combined behavioural and electrophysiological evidence.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9081553", "authors": ["Zaehle, T", "Sandmann, P", "Thorne, JD", "J\u00e4ncke, L", "Herrmann, CS"], "year": "2011", "journal": "BMC neuroscience", "abstract": "This large retrospective review identified only 26 (0.14%) cases with RTES-related complications; all but one of these were tongue lacerations, most of which were self-limiting.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Concomitant hypertension, bradycardia, and loss of transcranial electric motor evoked potentials during pedicle hook removal: report of a case.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "9474057", "authors": ["Ambardekar, AP", "Sestokas, AK", "Schwartz, DM", "Flynn, JM", "Rehman, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "abstract": "The results demonstrate that RTES is a highly safe modality for monitoring spinal cord motor tract function intraoperatively.", "pages": "187-93"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Hypomania induction in a patient with bipolar II disorder by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15598197", "authors": ["G\u00e1lvez, V", "Alonzo, A", "Martin, D", "Mitchell, PB", "Sachdev, P", "Loo, CK"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the noteworthy noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, but the mechanism of its action remains unclear.
