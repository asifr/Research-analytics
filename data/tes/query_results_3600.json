Stimulation can be directed to the intracranial part of the facial nerve, whereas the conventional electric stimuli are delivered extracranially to a more peripheral part of the nerve. Fourty healthy volunteers were examined to determine the normal responses for transcranial facial nerve stimulation. The center of the inducing coil ring was located so that its center was 3 cm posterior and 6 cm lateral to the vertex. Responses were recorded on the nasolabial fold. Latencies were 4.5 +/- 0.4 ms on both sides, being 1.1 ms longer than those elicited by electric stimulation of the nerve at the stylomastoid foramen. Amplitudes with magnetic stimuli were equal to those obtained with electric stimuli.

We asked subjects to report sensations felt after each stimulus. In all normal subjects, magnetic stimulation evoked sensations described as tingling or a wave descending along the leg, usually accompanied by EMG responses in leg muscles. In three of the seven patients, stimulation evoked sensations of tingling, numbness, touch, or a wave descending along the leg, lasting up to 10 seconds and referred to different parts of the legs and toes. In the patients, sensations were felt more distally the closer the site of stimulation was to the midline. Patients with leg paresthesias had less motor reorganization in abdominal muscles than those without paresthesias. These findings suggest that portions of the cortical representation areas for body parts deafferented by a complete spinal cord injury can remain related to those body parts for up to several years.

Magnetic stimulation at rest activated a larger fraction of the motoneuron pool and evoked MEPs with shorter latencies from a larger number of scalp positions in muscles immediately rostral to the level of a spinal cord injury than in corresponding muscles in controls. The MEPs associated with maximal voluntary activation were not significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest enhanced excitability of motor pathways targeting muscles rostral to the level of a spinal transection, reflecting reorganization of motor pathways either within cortical motor representation areas or at the level of the spinal cord. The data do not allow the determination of the contribution of spinal or cortical mechanisms. However, they support the notion of a limited flexible relationship between primary motor cortex and its target muscles following alterations of normal input-output patterns.", "pages": "259-63"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "[Motor evoked potentials for the determination of experimental spinal cord injuries].", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "1813238", "authors": ["Sun, TS"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]", "abstract": "In testing the clinical use of motor evoked potentials (MEP), optimal responses were obtained while using a stimulus with an intensity of 1100 V.

A significant enhancement was observed mainly with a conditioning subthreshold transcranial stimulus and when MEPs were obtained in coincidence with weak voluntary contraction of the target muscle. Subthreshold stimulation of Ia fibers of the median nerve seemed to have a smaller facilitatory effect. It is generally accepted that PCS excites the spinal motoneuron (SMN) axons at the spinal nerve. However, our results show that other SMNs, usually not recruited, may be triggered by PCS when they receive excitatory postsynaptic potentials from the pyramidal tract (PT) or Ia fibers. This behavior suggests that low intensity PCS also exerts subthreshold excitation of the PT fibers and, perhaps, of the incoming spindle afferents, which adds its effects to the conditioning stimuli.", "pages": "259-63"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "2067635", "authors": ["Dhuna, A", "Gates, J", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "We studied the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied in trains of 8- to 25-Hz stimuli on electroencephalographic epileptiform activity on eight patients being evaluated for epilepsy surgery.

This differential facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons was observed at all stimulus sites on the scalp and all stimulus intensities at which responses could be elicited. In subjects with CP, magnetic stimulation produced almost equal facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons. This could not be explained by differences in the excitability of the respective motoneuron pools. It is postulated that the projections from the motor cortex to spinal motoneurons are altered in CP.

A method of monitoring that allows direct and continuous assessment of motor function within the central nervous system during surgery would be useful. This paper describes one such method utilizing noninvasive electric cortical stimulation to evoke muscle activity (the motor evoked potential, or MEP) during surgery. The effect of isoflurane (superimposed on a baseline of N2O/narcotic anesthesia) on MEP's in response to cortical stimulation is specifically examined. Eight patients undergoing elective neurosurgical operations were included in the study. All patients received a background of general anesthesia and partial nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The motor cortex was stimulated electrically via self-adhesive scalp electrodes. Electromyographic responses from multiple muscles were measured with subdermal electroencephalograph-type needle electrodes. Motor responses to stimulation were continually recorded on magnetic tape for off-line analysis. Once closing of the surgical incision was begun, a series of four to five stimuli of constant magnitude were applied to obtain \"baseline\" MEP responses. Patients were then ventilated with isoflurane for up to 8 minutes, during which time stimuli were continued every 15 to 20 seconds. Comparison was made of MEP responses for trials before, 1 minute after, and 5 minutes after the addition of isoflurane. All patients demonstrated reproducible motor responses to cortical stimulation during surgery. Addition of isoflurane [isoflurane)exp, less than or equal to 0.5%) to pre-existing anesthesia caused marked attenuation of MEP amplitudes in all patients within 5 minutes of its application, without affecting neuromuscular transmission as judged by direct peripheral nerve stimulation. It is concluded that: 1) monitoring motor system integrity and function with electric transcranial cortical stimulation during surgery is feasible when utilizing an N2O/narcotic anesthetic protocol; and 2) the quality of data obtained will likely suffer with the addition of isoflurane.", "pages": "259-63"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Motor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "2033449", "authors": ["Fries, W", "Danek, A", "Witt, TN"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Motor responses were evoked in the thenar muscles by transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in 5 stroke patients with an isolated lacuna in the internal capsule, in whom wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract was demonstrated in vivo.

Focused magnetic brain stimulation was performed in 1 patient and gave identical results. Because muscular excitability to cortical stimulation is preserved in spite of pyramidal tract disruption, other pathways must bypass the lesion.

It consists of central motor pathways and peripheral nerve fibers. Transcranial magnetoelectric stimulation of the brain and magnetoelectric stimulation of the lumbosacral motor roots were performed in 10 healthy volunteers. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the external anal sphincter. This procedure allowed differentiation between a predominantly central and a solely peripheral component of the motor innervation of the external and sphincter. To compare these recordings with well-established data, motor evoked potentials were also recorded from the anterior tibial muscle. The central motor conduction time was 20.9 +/- 2.4 ms to the external anal sphincter and 14.8 +/- 2.3 ms to the anterior tibial muscles. Central motor conduction velocities were 40.7 +/- 5.2 and 55.5 +/- 7.6 m/s, respectively. This showed that conduction in the central fibers to the external anal sphincter was significantly slower than in those to the anterior tibial muscle. We conclude 1) that magnetoelectric stimulation allows differentiation between central and peripheral portions of the motor innervation of the pelvic floor, and 2) that central motor pathways innervating the pelvic floor differ significantly in their physiological properties from those innervating limb muscles.", "pages": "259-63"}]
