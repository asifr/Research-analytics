Supplement", "abstract": "Since the initial publication of Tsubokawa in 1991, epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is increasingly reported as an effective surgical option for the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain although its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. The authors review the extensive literature published over the last 15 years on central and neuropathic pain. Optimal patient selection remains difficult and the value of pharmacological tests or transcranial magnetic stimulation in predicting the efficacy of MCS has not been established. Pre-operative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 3-dimensional volume MRI, neuronavigation and intra-operative neurophysiological monitoring have contributed to improvements in the technique for identifying the precise location of the targeted motor cortical area and the correct placement of the electrode array. MCS should be considered as the treatment of choice in post-stroke pain, thalamic pain or facial anesthesia dolorosa. In brachial plexus avulsion pain, it is preferable to propose initially dorsal root entry zone (DREZ)-tomy; MCS may be offered after DREZotomy has failed to control the pain. In our experience, the results of MCS on phantom limb pain are promising. In general, the efficacy of MCS depends on: a) the accurate placement of the stimulation electrode over the appropriate area of the motor cortex, and b) on sophisticated programming of the stimulation parameters. A better understanding of the MCS mechanism of action will probably make it possible to adjust better the stimulation parameters. The conclusions of multicentered randomised studies, now in progress, will be very useful and are likely to promote further research and clinical applications in this field.", "pages": "37-44"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Extradural cortical stimulation for central pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17691286", "authors": ["Canavero, S", "Bonicalzi, V"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement", "abstract": "Central pain results from a central nervous system injury and represents a challenge for the pain therapist. Human studies have shown that motor cortex stimulation (MCS), i.e. the placement of a stimulating plate on the dura overlying the motor cortex can relieve brain central pain. Studies suggest that MCS directly affects activity in the first and second order somatosensory areas, thalamic nuclei and also inhibits spinal primary afferents and spinothalamic tract neurons. The following factors have been found to predict analgesia by MCS: intact or almost intact corticospinal motor function, mild or negligible sensory loss, absence of thermal sensory threshold alteration within the painful area, positive response to the barbiturate and/or ketamine test, positive response to the propofol test, positive response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The targeting of the cortical area is made by anatomical localization by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuronavigation, intraoperative neurophysiological recordings, functional MRI (fMRI), and intraoperative clinical assessment. We perform the procedure under local anaesthesia. We describe in detail our surgical technique and stimulation protocol. Furthermore, we review the most important studies with respect to their results, the observed side effects and complications. The future prospects and likely developments of MCS for central pain are also discussed.", "pages": "37-44"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Time course of the involvement of the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams in a visuospatial task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "17689572", "authors": ["Ellison, A", "Cowey, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "A previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study [Ellison, A., & Cowey, A. (2006). TMS can reveal contrasting functions of the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams. Experimental Brain Research, 175, 618-625] showed that both the dorsal and ventral cortical visual processing streams are involved in the processing of a task in which judgement of relative spatial position is required. In order to determine whether both streams are active in a parallel or serial manner, a double pulse TMS (20 Hz) experiment was carried out to expose peaks of disruption, indicative of when each of the areas under investigation is most potently involved. Results show that TMS over lateral occipital cortex produces greater disruption of performance than that provoked by TMS over posterior parietal cortex, significantly so when applied at 50 and 100 ms post-visual array onset. Both areas showed peaks of disruption up to 350 ms after visual stimulus onset. The results are discussed with respect to why each of these areas is involved in this task and what the pattern of their involvement reveals.", "pages": "37-44"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "The time course of idiom processing.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "17675192", "authors": ["Fogliata, A", "Rizzo, S", "Reati, F", "Miniussi, C", "Oliveri, M", "Papagno, C"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Recent neuropsychological and neurophysiological studies have suggested that the neural correlates of idiom processing are predominantly located in the left Brodmann's area (BA) 22 and, to some extent, in the prefrontal cortex. The present study explores the temporal dynamics of left prefrontal and temporal cortex in idiom processing by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in normal subjects. Forty-five opaque highly familiar idioms and 45 literal sentences were used. Forty-three subjects completed 5 blocks of 18 trials (9 idioms, 9 literal sentences) corresponding to 4 stimulation conditions (left prefrontal, left temporal, vertex, no-stimulation baseline). Each subject was assigned to one of three groups, which differed in the timing of stimulation delivery. A selective impairment in accuracy for idioms was found when rTMS was applied to the prefrontal and temporal cortex 80ms after picture presentation, confirming the role of these regions in this task. Moreover, rTMS to the prefrontal cortex, but not to the temporal cortex, continued to affect the performance with idiomatic sentences at the later time of 120ms. The results seem to suggest that the prefrontal region is involved in both the retrieval of the figurative meaning from semantic memory and the monitoring of the response by inhibiting alternative interpretations when a picture-matching task is used.", "pages": "37-44"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Making the blindsighted see.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "17669445", "authors": ["Silvanto, J", "Cowey, A", "Lavie, N", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "A lesion of striate cortex, area V1, produces blindness in the retinotopically corresponding part of the visual field, although in some cases visual abilities in the blind field remain that are paradoxically devoid of conscious visual percepts (\"blindsight\"). Here we demonstrate that the blindsight subject GY can experience visual sensations of phosphenes in his blind field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Such blind field percepts could only be induced when stimulation was applied bilaterally, i.e. over GY's area V5/MT in both hemispheres. Consistent with an earlier report [Cowey, A., & Walsh, V. (2000). Magnetically induced phosphenes in sighted, blind and blindsighted observers. Neuroreport, 11, 3269-3273], GY never experienced phosphenes when stimulation was restricted to his ipsilesional V5/MT. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time GY has experienced visual qualia in his blind hemifield. The present report characterizes the necessary conditions for such conscious experience in his hemianopic visual field and interprets them as demonstrating that only via a contribution from GY's intact hemisphere can activation in the damaged hemisphere reach visual awareness.", "pages": "37-44"}, {"volume": "263", "title": "Role of the cerebellum in time perception: a TMS study in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "17655867", "authors": ["Fierro, B", "Palermo, A", "Puma, A", "Francolini, M", "Panetta, ML", "Daniele, O", "Brighina, F"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the cerebellum in a temporal-discrimination task without movement production in healthy subjects.

Two pairs of electrical stimuli: the first considered the reference pair (rp) with a standard interval of 400 ms and the second, the test pair (tp), with variable intervals ranging from 300 to 500 ms, were applied by surface electrodes on the right forearm. Subjects were instructed to compare time intervals of rp and tp and to estimate whether the tp interval was shorter than, equal to, or longer than that of rp. The task was performed in baseline and after 1 Hz rTMS over the right and left cerebellar hemisphere. The right cerebellar rTMS worsened temporal discrimination of cutaneous somatosensory electrical stimuli on the ipsilateral hand. rTMS of the left cerebellar hemisphere did not determine significant changes in the subjects' performance with respect to the baseline.
