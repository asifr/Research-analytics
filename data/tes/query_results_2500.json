We found reduction of MEP amplitudes on the stimulated side and, most importantly, disinhibition of intracortical excitability of the homologous M1. This crossed effect of rTMS supports the concept of a physiological balance of reciprocal inhibitory projections and emphasizes that rTMS can induce remote effects that are relevant for the physiological interpretation of such interventions.", "pages": "609-12"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Patterned sensory stimulation induces plasticity in reciprocal ia inhibition in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "12657659", "authors": ["Perez, MA", "Field-Fote, EC", "Floeter, MK"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Training of spinal cord circuits using sensorimotor stimulation has been proposed as a strategy to improve movement after spinal injury. How sensory stimulation may lead to long-lasting changes is not well understood. We studied whether sensory stimulation might induce changes in the strength of a specific spinal interneuronal circuit: spinally mediated reciprocal Ia inhibition. In healthy humans, the strength of reciprocal inhibition between ankle flexor and extensor muscles was assessed before and after 30 min of peroneal nerve stimulation at motor threshold intensity. Three stimulation protocols were assessed: patterned nerve stimulation (10 pulses at 100 Hz every 1.5 sec), uniform nerve stimulation (one pulse every 150 msec), and combined stimulation of the peroneal nerve and the motor cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Short-latency reciprocal inhibition from ankle flexor to extensor muscles was measured by conditioning the soleus H-reflex with stimulation of the common peroneal nerve. The strength of the reciprocal inhibition was measured at baseline and for 20 min after each stimulation session. Patterned stimulation, with or without motor cortex stimulation, enhanced reciprocal inhibition for at least 5 min afterward. The uniform pattern of stimulation was ineffective. These results demonstrate the presence of short-term plasticity within spinal inhibitory circuits. We conclude that the pattern of sensory input is a crucial factor for inducing changes in the spinal circuit for reciprocal inhibition in humans. These findings may have implications for the use of repetitive patterned sensory stimulation in rehabilitative efforts to improve walking ability in patients with spinal injury.", "pages": "609-12"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Enhancing cognitive performance with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at human individual alpha frequency.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12653991", "authors": ["Klimesch, W", "Sauseng, P", "Gerloff, C"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "We applied rapid-rate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at individual alpha frequency (IAF) to improve cognitive performance by influencing the dynamics of alpha desynchronization. Previous research indicates that a large upper alpha power in a reference interval preceding a task is related to both large suppression of upper alpha power during the task and good performance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that rTMS at individual upper alpha frequency (IAF + 1 Hz) can enhance alpha power in the reference interval, and can thus improve task performance. Repetitive TMS was delivered to the mesial frontal (Fz) and right parietal (P6) cortex, and as sham condition with 90 degrees-tilted coil (P6 position). The behavioural effect was assessed in a mental rotation task. Further control conditions were rTMS at a lower IAF (IAF - 3 Hz) and at 20 Hz. The results indicate that rTMS at IAF + 1 Hz can enhance task performance and, concomitantly, the extent of task-related alpha desynchronization. This provides further evidence for the functional relevance of oscillatory neuronal activity in the alpha band for the implementation of cognitive performance.", "pages": "609-12"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "The essential role of Broca's area in imitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12653990", "authors": ["Heiser, M", "Iacoboni, M", "Maeda, F", "Marcus, J", "Mazziotta, JC"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The posterior sector of Broca's area (Brodmann area 44), a brain region critical for language, may have evolved from neurons active during observation and execution of manual movements. Imaging studies showing increased Broca's activity during execution, imagination, imitation and observation of hand movements support this hypothesis. Increased Broca's activity in motor task, however, may simply be due to inner speech. To test whether Broca's area is essential to imitation, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is known to transiently disrupt functions in stimulated areas. Subjects imitated finger key presses (imitation) or executed finger key presses in response to spatial cues (control task). While performing the tasks, subjects received rTMS over the left and right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (where Brodmann area 44 is probabilistically located) and over the occipital cortex. There was significant impairment in imitation, but not in the control task, during rTMS over left and right pars opercularis compared to rTMS over the occipital cortex. This suggests that Broca's area is a premotor region essential to finger movement imitation.", "pages": "609-12"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Neurogenic motor evoked potentials: role in brachial plexus surgery.

Traditional intraoperative neurophysiological assessment methods like nerve action potential (NAP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring have been used to evaluate proximal nerve stump integrity, but these methods do not allow evaluation of the integrity of motor fibers back to the anterior horn cell. Consequently, the authors used transcranial electrical stimulation and recorded neurogenic motor evoked potentials (MEPs) directly from the brachial plexus in a patient undergoing surgical repair of a complete upper brachial plexus injury (Erb palsy) to assess the functional continuity of motor fibers. In addition, selected elements of the brachial plexus were directly stimulated, and NAPs were recorded. Finally, SSEPs were recorded from the scalp after stimulation of selected elements of the brachial plexus. Neurogenic MEPs were present from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, but not the middle or upper trunk; NAPs were present from the lateral and posterior cords after middle trunk stimulation, but absent after upper trunk stimulation; and SSEPs were present after medial cord stimulation but absent after stimulation of the upper and middle trunks. For the first time, neurogenic MEPs were coupled with NAPs and SSEPs to evaluate successfully the functional status of motor fibers back to the anterior horn cell for accurate localization of the lesion sites.", "pages": "609-12"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Anxiety induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is suppressed by chronic treatment of paroxetine in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12649768", "authors": ["Isogawa, K", "Fujiki, M", "Akiyoshi, J", "Tsutsumi, T", "Horinouchi, Y", "Kodama, K", "Nagayama, H"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Pharmacopsychiatry", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on affective disorder and anxiety disorders.

In normal rats, rTMS for 10 days induced anxiety, as shown by elevated plus maze, black and white box, and conditioned fear tests. This anxiety was suppressed by chronic, but not acute, paroxetine.

In 7 out of the 10 subjects, we were able to localize a region in the prefrontal cortex that when stimulated produced delays in the execution of contralateral saccadic eye movements. The location of this functionally defined FEF region across these subjects was approximately 1.5 cm anterior to the motor hand area, although there was considerable variability in this measure.

Subjects were recruited and randomized more than 1 year after a single subcortical infarction. Clinical assessments performed before and after the intervention and at 6 months postintervention included the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Motor Activity Log (MAL), and the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS).

MAL increased by 1.08 after CI therapy and decreased by 0.01 after control therapy. The difference between groups was significant (P < 0.001). Changes in WMFT and AMPS were not significantly different between groups. Cerebral activation during a motor task decreased significantly, and motor map size increased in the affected hemisphere motor cortex in CI patients but not in control patients.

Lateral electrical stimulation of the motor cortex preferentially activates the axons of corticospinal neurones in the subcortical white matter, and evokes a D-wave in pyramidal tract. The way of activation of corticospinal neurones using magnetic stimulation depends on the direction of the electrical current induced in the brain and on the shape of the coil. Monophasic magnetic stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil inducing posterior-anterior current in the brain activates corticospinal neurones trans-synaptically recruiting an 11-wave, with later I-waves appearing in sequence at higher intensities and a D-wave at very high intensities. If the induced current is rotated to the anterior-posterior direction late I-waves are preferentially recruited and when a D-wave is recruited, it has a later onset than the electrical D-wave, suggesting an activation nearer the cell body of the pyramidal neurones. A latero-medial induced current activates both corticospinal axons at the same point as electrical stimulation evoking a D wave and cortico-cortical axons evoking I-waves. A nonfocal large circular coil centered at the vertex is capable of activating pyramidal neurones both at the initial segment and trans-synaptically evoking a D wave with a longer latency than the electrical D-wave and I-waves. Using a biphasic magnetic stimulation, both phases of the biphasic pulse are capable of activating descending motor output and the pattern of recruitment of descending activity depends on the intensity of the stimulus and the relative threshold of each volley to each direction of current flow.", "pages": "609-12"}]
