To accomplish this, anterior cerebral artery (ACA) mean blood velocity (V(mean)) responses were assessed during sustained and rhythmic passive calf muscle stretch (mechanoreflex), volitional calf exercise (mechanoreflex, metaboreflex, and central command), and electrically stimulated calf exercise (mechanoreflex and metaboreflex but no central command) at 35% of maximum voluntary contraction (n = 16). In addition, a period of postexercise muscle ischemia (PEMI) was used to isolate the metaboreflex. Blood pressure, cardiac output, and the end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pet(CO2)) were also measured. ACA V(mean) was unchanged from rest during either sustained or rhythmic calf muscle stretch (P > 0.05). However, ACA V(mean) was increased from rest during both isometric (+15 +/- 1%) and rhythmic (+15 +/- 2%, voluntary exercise P < 0.05) but remained unchanged during stimulated exercise (P > 0.05). Isometric and rhythmic exercise-induced increases in blood pressure and cardiac output were similar during voluntary and stimulated exercise (P > 0.05 between conditions). Blood pressure remained elevated during PEMI after all exercise conditions (P < 0.05 vs. rest), whereas cardiac output and ACA V(mean) were not different from rest (P > 0.05). Pet(CO2) was unchanged from rest throughout. These data suggest that selective activation of skeletal muscle afferents (i.e., stretch, PEMI, or stimulated exercise) does not increase ACA V(mean) and that increases in ACA V(mean) during volitional contractions of an exercising calf muscle are dependent on the presence of central command.", "pages": "1113-20"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Effects of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on treatment resistant auditory-verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "19679450", "authors": ["Vercammen, A", "Knegtering, H", "Bruggeman, R", "Westenbroek, HM", "Jenner, JA", "Slooff, CJ", "Wunderink, L", "Aleman, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Schizophrenia research", "abstract": "Neuroimaging findings implicate bilateral superior temporal regions in the genesis of auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH).

This double-blind, randomized study tested tDCS at the same stimulation parameters as a previous positive study (1 mA current strength, five treatment sessions, active or sham, given on alternate days) in 40 depressed participants. Anodal stimulation was centred over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with the cathode placed on the lateral aspect of the contralateral orbit. tDCS was continued up to a total of ten active sessions per participant. Mood outcomes were measured by psychiatrist raters blind to treatment condition using the Montgomery-Asberg and other depression rating scales. Psychomotor speed was assessed immediately before and after a single tDCS session and attention, frontal executive function, working memory and verbal learning were assessed after each group of five sessions. Overall depression scores improved significantly over ten tDCS treatments, but there was no between-group difference in the five-session, sham-controlled phase. tDCS was found to be safe, with no adverse effects on neuropsychological function, and only minor side-effects.

TRNS is a novel method of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation whereby a random electrical oscillation spectrum is applied over the cortex. A previous study recently reported that application of weak 10-min tRNS over primary motor cortex (M1) enhances corticospinal excitability both during and after stimulation in the healthy human brain. Here, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI was used to monitor modulations in human sensorimotor activity after the application of 4-min tRNS. Activation maps for a right hand index-thumb finger opposition task were obtained for nine subjects after sham and 1-mA tRNS in separate sessions. TRNS of the left-hemispheric sensorimotor cortex resulted in a decrease in the mean number of activated pixels by 17%, in the hand area. Our results indicate that tRNS applied with different durations and/or in combination with a task might result in different outcomes. Application of tRNS to the human cortex allows an unnoticeable and thus painless, selective, non-invasive and reversible activity change within the cortex, its main advantage being the direction insensitivity of the stimulation. TRNS also provides a qualitatively new way of producing and interfering with brain plasticity, although, further research is required to optimise stimulation parameters and efficacy.", "pages": "1113-20"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "A study of the effectiveness of high-frequency left prefrontal cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation in major depression in patients who have not responded to right-sided stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19643184", "authors": ["Fitzgerald, PB", "McQueen, S", "Herring, S", "Hoy, K", "Segrave, R", "Kulkarni, J", "Daskalakis, ZJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and tractography allows investigating functional anatomy of the human brain with high precision.

Facilitation was obtained only with a TMS pulse applied to a location of the MFG with anatomical connectivity to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). TMS improved tactile WM also when distractive tactile stimuli interfered with memory maintenance. Moreover, TMS to the same MFG site attenuated somatosensory evoked responses (SEPs). The results suggest that the TMS-induced memory improvement is explained by increased top-down suppression of interfering sensory processing in S1 via the MFG-S1 link.

We prospectively evaluated whether the combined use of somatosensory- and motor-evoked potential (SEP/MEP) for intramedullary spinal cord tumor (IMSCT) surgery may be beneficial. Combined SEP/MEP monitoring was attempted in 20 consecutive procedures for IMSCT operations. Trains of transcranial electric stimulation over the motor cortex were used to elicit MEPs from limb target muscles. The tibial and median nerves were stimulated to record SEP. The operation was paused or the surgical strategy was modified in every case of significant SEP/MEP changes. Combined SEP/MEP recording was successfully achieved in 17 of 20 (85%) operations. In 3 of 17 operations, SEP and MEP were stable, and all patients remained neurologically intact after surgery. Significant MEP changes were recorded in 12 operations (70%). In 7 of these 12 operations, MEP recovered to some extent after surgical intervention, and these patients showed no neurological changes. In the remaining 5 operations, MEP did not recover and the patients had a transient (n = 2) or a permanent (n = 1) motor deficit. Significant SEP changes with stable MEP were related to a transient hypesthesia. Combined SEP/MEP monitoring provided higher sensitivity, and higher positive and negative predictive value than single-modality techniques.
