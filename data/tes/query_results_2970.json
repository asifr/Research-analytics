In the present study we investigated the role of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in this process in normal, healthy subjects. This was accomplished by delivering single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the PPC to transiently disrupt the putative contribution of this area to the processing of information related to eye-hand coordination. Subjects made open-loop pointing movements accompanied by saccades of the same required amplitude or by saccades that were substantially larger. Without TMS the hand movement amplitude was influenced by the amplitude of the corresponding saccade; hand movements accompanied by larger saccades were larger than those accompanied by smaller saccades. When TMS was applied over the left PPC just prior to the onset of the saccade, a marked reduction in the saccadic influence on manual motor output was observed. TMS delivered at earlier or later periods during the response had no effect. Taken together, these data suggest that the PPC integrates signals related to saccade amplitude with limb movement information just prior to the onset of the saccade.", "pages": "1677-80"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Age-related changes in muscle fatigue resistance in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10975534", "authors": ["Chan, KM", "Raja, AJ", "Strohschein, FJ", "Lechelt, K"], "year": "2000", "journal": "The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

The elderly group's greater fatigue resistance was accounted for by increased fatigue resistance at the muscle level as well as in the central nervous system.

The corpus callosum is crucial for the coordination of bimanual motor activity, but neurophysiological correlates of morphological differences in the corpus callosum of musicians are not known. In the present study we have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess interhemispheric inhibition in six adult professional musicians who began musical training at an early age. Conditioning TMS was applied to the hand area of the motor cortex of one hemisphere, followed 4-16 ms later by a test stimulus applied to the other hemisphere. Tests were performed at rest, and with the first dorsal interosseous muscle contralateral to the conditioning hemisphere voluntarily active. Conditioning TMS in musicians was 29% less effective at reducing the size of the test MEP at rest, and 63% less effective in the active condition, compared with control subjects. We conclude that transcallosal interhemispheric inhibitory circuits activated by TMS are less effective in musicians than in controls.", "pages": "1677-80"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Suppression of vision by transcranial magnetic stimulation: a third mechanism.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "10943683", "authors": ["Corthout, E", "Uttl, B", "Juan, CH", "Hallett, M", "Cowey, A"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded in 7 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) to asses the involvement of pyramidal motor pathways in these cases.
