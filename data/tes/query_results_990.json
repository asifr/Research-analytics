Conference", "abstract": "When the odd stimulation is presented, the positive component of electroencephalograph is induced at around 300 ms after the odd stimulation. This positive component is called P300. Many studies suggest that P300 may result from the summation of activity from multiple generators located in widespread cortical and subcortical areas. However, there is still no conclusive indication of the sources of P300. In this paper, we focus on the left supramaginal gyrus as one of the sources of P300. We investigated the temporal aspect of this area using TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). We investigated the relationship between the latency of the P300 and an effect of TMS when the left supramarginal gyrus was stimulated by TMS. In our previous study, we reported a method of removing stimulus artifact during TMS with Sample-and-Hold circuit and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity evoked by TMS could be measured successfully. In addition to this method, independent component analysis (ICA) was also applied to recorded EEG data in order to remove the stimulus artifact by off-line analysis. By using these methods, short latency (< 15 ms) EEG responses to TMS could be obtained. We stimulated the left supramarginal gyrus using a figure-eight coil during auditory oddball task. The TMS at 150 ms and 200 ms after the oddball sounds were presented. When the TMS was applied at 200 ms after the oddball stimulation, the peak response of P300 was delayed around 50 ms. Difference of the peak latency between the control measurement and the case of TMS applying at 150 ms was not significant. However, the differences of the peak latency of the control measurement and the peak latency of the measurement in the cases of TMS applying at 200 ms and 250 ms was significant (p<0.05). We considered that this delay was due to inhibiting to recognize the target stimulation.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "Effect of anatomical variability on neural stimulation strength and focality in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST).", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19964484", "authors": ["Deng, ZD", "Lisanby, SH", "Peterchev, AV"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ... Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Conference", "abstract": "We present a quantitative comparison of two metrics-neural stimulation strength and focality-in electrocon-vulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST) using finite-element method (FEM) simulation in a spherical head model. Five stimulation modalities were modeled, including bilateral ECT, unilateral ECT, focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST), and MST with circular and double-cone coils, with stimulation parameters identical to those applied in clinical practice. We further examine the effect on the stimulation metrics of individual-, sex- and age-related variability in tissue layer thickness and conductivity. Neural stimulation by MST is shown to be more focal and superficial than ECT. This result suggests that it may be advantageous to reduce the current used in ECT. The stimulation strength in MST is also less sensitive to variations in head geometry and tissue conductivity than in ECT. Individualization of pulse amplitude in both ECT and MST could compensate for anatomical variability, which could lead to more consistent clinical outcomes.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of small animals: a modeling study of the influence of coil geometry, size and orientation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19964482", "authors": ["Salvador, R", "Miranda, PC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Several recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using small animals. However, there is still limited knowledge about the distribution of the induced electric field, and its dependence on coil size, geometry and orientation. In this work we calculate the electric field induced in a realistically shaped homogeneous mouse model by commercially available coils in several different orientations. The results show that the secondary field, resulting from charge accumulation at the skin - air interface, drastically changes the magnitude, decay and focality of the primary field induced by the coil. Accurate knowledge about the distribution of the field is invaluable in designing experimental protocols and new coils for small animal stimulation.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "One-dimensional representation of a neuron in a uniform electric field.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19964438", "authors": ["Radman, T", "Datta, A", "Ramos, RL", "Brumberg, JC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Specific neuronal elements targeted by cortical stimulation are considered to underlie therapeutic effects, but the exact cell-type(s) affected by these methods remains poorly understood. We determined if neuronal morphology predicted responses to subthreshold uniform electric fields. We characterized the effects of subthreshold electrical stimulation on identified cortical neurons in vitro. Uniform electric fields were applied to rat motor cortex brain slices, while recording from interneurons and pyramidal cells across cortical layers, using whole cell patch clamp. Neuron morphology was reconstructed following intracellular dialysis of biocytin. Based solely on volume-weighted morphology, we developed a simplified model of neuronal polarization by sub-threshold electric field: an electrotonically linear cylinder that further predicts polarization at distal dendritic tree terminations. We found that neuronal morphology correlated with somatic sub-threshold polarization. Layer V/VI pyramidal neuron somata (individually) and dendrites (averaging across neurons) were most sensitive to sub-threshold fields. This analysis was extended to predict a terminal polarization of a human cortical neuron as 1.44 mV during tDCS.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "Bio-heat transfer model of transcranial DC stimulation: comparison of conventional pad versus ring electrode.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14978199", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Elwassif, M", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The proliferation of this therapy has been accompanied by isolated reports regarding concern about their safety namely skin irritation. The potential cause of skin irritation has sometimes been attributed to increased scalp temperature during stimulation. We have developed novel technology for tDCS that improves spatial focality at the cost of increased stimulation electrode current density; high density tDCS (HD-tDCS). The goal of this paper was to provide information on the thermal effects of tDCS using a MRI-derived finite element human head model. The tissue temperature increases of tDCS using conventional rectangular-pad (7 x 5 cm(2)) and HD-tDCS using the ring (4 x 1) electrode configurations were compared using a bio-heat model. Our results indicate that clinical tDCS do not increase tissue temperature and 4 x 1 ring configurations leads to a negligible increase in scalp temperature.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "587", "title": "The fatigued spinal cord.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 23", "pmid": "17337213", "authors": ["Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "A preliminary report of a new operative method termed selective laminoplasty after the preoperative diagnosis of the responsible level using spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEPs) in elderly patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Selective laminoplasty after the preoperative diagnosis of the responsible level using spinal cord evoked potentials in elderly patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a preliminary report.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "3655019", "authors": ["Kato, Y", "Kojima, T", "Kataoka, H", "Imajo, Y", "Yara, T", "Yoshida, Y", "Imagama, T", "Taguchi, T"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of spinal disorders & techniques", "abstract": "To introduce the method and clinical results for selective laminoplasty.", "pages": "1359-62"}, {"volume": "152", "title": "Robot-assisted image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation for somatotopic mapping of the motor cortex: a clinical pilot study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "3236254", "authors": ["Kantelhardt, SR", "Fadini, T", "Finke, M", "Kallenberg, K", "Siemerkus, J", "Bockermann, V", "Matthaeus, L", "Paulus, W", "Schweikard, A", "Rohde, V", "Giese, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "Clinical results for conventional laminoplasty and anterior decompression and fusion guided by SCEPs have been reported.
