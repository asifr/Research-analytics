The motor central conduction time after transcranial and spinal stimulation can be determined at cervical 6/7. It is at 5.0 ms in normal subjects. This was demonstrated in four normal subjects. After spinal stimulation at cervical 6/7 a motor evoked potential can also be recorded from the scalp. It has a latency that is comparable to motor conduction time. In animal experiments in examining ten rabbits a motor evoked potential to stimulation at several levels of the spinal cord could also be determined.", "pages": "197-200"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Nonpyramidal motor activation produced by stimulation of the cerebellum, direct or transcranial: a cerebellar evoked potential.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "3748346", "authors": ["Levy, WJ", "McCaffrey, M", "Goldman, D", "York, DH"], "year": "1986", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "There is a need to monitor the functional status of the motor pathways well enough to predict the state of that function during operations and in injured or diseased patients. We previously reported that a motor evoked potential (MEP) can be produced by direct or transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex in both cats and humans. This signal descends through both the dorsolateral and ventral spinal cord and is primarily localized in the pyramidal tracts, producing a peripheral nerve signal and an electromyogram (EMG) response. It is more sensitive to injury than the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). We report here that one can stimulate the cerebellar cortex, either directly or transcranially, and produce a descending signal in the spinal cord that has different characteristics from the MEP. The cerebellar evoked potential (CEP), located in the dorsolateral and the ventral cord, has an earlier latency and a faster conduction velocity than the MEP. It is predominantly ipsilateral with some contralateral components and also produces EMG responses. In the peripheral nerves, the CEP often produces a pattern of several waves that is different from the one or two predominant contralateral waves of the MEP. The CEP is not diminished by pyramidotomy. It arises from two sites on the cerebellar cortex, medial and lateral. The pathways activated may be the vestibulospinal, rubrospinal, reticulospinal, and fastigiospinal systems. This test seems to offer a monitor of selected motor pathways in the spinal cord largely separate from and complementary to the MEP. The ventral pathways activated probably include those demonstrated to be most essential to basic ambulation after spinal cord injury in primates. Also of importance, one type of evoked potential can facilitate another, which provides additional diagnostic tests. The CEP should be of investigative and clinical value.", "pages": "197-200"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[Use of transcranial electroanalgesia in cephalalgias of various origins].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "3487167", "authors": ["Zabolotnykh, VA", "Lebedev, VP", "Mishina, NM", "Petrova, EP", "Afoshin, SA"], "year": "", "journal": "Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebno\u012d fizichesko\u012d kultury", "abstract": "Electrical monitoring of the motor system offers the potential for the detection of injury, the diagnosis of disease, the evaluation of treatment, and the prediction of recovery from damage. Existing evoked potentials monitor one or another sensory modality, but no generally usable motor monitor exists. We have reported a motor evoked potential using direct stimulation of the spinal cord over the motor tracts in cats and in humans. To achieve a less invasive monitor, we used transcranial stimulation over the motor cortex in the cat, thus stimulating the motor cortex. We report here the initial application of this method to humans. A plate electrode over the motor cortex on the scalp and a second electrode on the palate direct a mild current through the motor cortex which will activate the motor pathways. This signal can be recorded over the spinal cord. It can elicit contralateral peripheral nerve and electromyographic signals in the limbs or movements when the appropriate stimulation parameters are used. In clinical use to date, this has been more reliable than the somatosensory evoked potential in predicting motor function in patients where the two tests differed. It offers a number of possibilities for the development of valuable brain and spinal cord monitoring techniques, but requires further animal studies and clinical experience. Studies to date have not demonstrated adverse effects, but evaluation is continuing.", "pages": "197-200"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "[Changes in the beta-endorphin levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid during transcranial electroanalgesia].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "3156056", "authors": ["A\u012drapetov, LN", "Za\u012dchik, AM", "Trukhmanov, MS", "Lebedev, VP", "Sorokoumov, VA"], "year": "1985", "journal": "Fiziologicheski\u012d zhurnal SSSR imeni I.

We previously reported using a motor evoked potential created by direct excitation of the spinal cord, placing a stimulating electrode over the corticospinal tract area. To produce a less invasive test, we now use direct transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex through the scalp or direct stimulation of the motor cortex itself during operation. A descending signal can be recorded over the spinal cord and in the peripheral nerves where no retrograde sensory signals should be able to descend. This motor cortex stimulation produces contralateral limb movements and selective activation of the peripheral nerves of a limb. The characteristics of this signal are similar to those described in the neurophysiological literature for a descending motor signal. With a depth electrode, it was found that the signal was strongest in the spinal cord near the corticospinal tracts and in the anterior horn cell area. A set of lesioning studies showed that most of the signal travels in the area of the corticospinal tract, with some traveling in the ventral portion of the spinal cord, perhaps in the anterior corticospinal tract. Section of the pyramid essentially abolishes the signal, but lesioning of the red nucleus does not. This test offers an electrical assessment of the motor system that can be useful in experimental work on spinal cord and brain function.
