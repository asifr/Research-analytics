However, rTMS protocols need to be optimized. Basic researches in TMS led to the concept of \"state dependency TMS\". This concept suggests that the neural circuits' activation states, before and during the stimulation, influence the pulse effect. Indeed, TMS effect must be seen, not simply as a stimulus, but also as the result of an interaction between a stimulus and a level of brain activity. Those data suggest that rTMS efficiency could be increased in psychiatric disorders by triggering patients' neurocognitive activities during stimulation.

They aim at regulating emotional states of depressed patients during the stimulation. The patients perform emotional tasks in order to activate cortical networks involving the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) into a state that may be more sensitive to the rTMS pulse effect. Simultaneous cognitive behavioral therapy (\"CBT rTMS\") and cognitive-emotional reactivation (\"affective rTMS\") have thus been tested during left DLPFC rTMS in MDE. Interactive rTMS protocols that manipulate brain electrical activities have been developed for MDE and schizophrenia treatments. Two categories of protocols should be identified. In the first set, personalized brain activity has been analyzed to determine the parameters of stimulation (i.e. frequency of stimulation) matching the patient (\"personalized rTMS\"). Personalized rTMS protocols can be made \"online\" or \"offline\" depending on whether the EEG activity is measured during or prior to rTMS. Online protocol is called \"contingent rTMS\": it consists in stimulating the brain only when a specific EEG pattern involving the intensity of alpha rhythm is recorded and recognized. Offline protocol is called \"alpha rTMS\", and relies on ascertaining frequency of stimulation in accordance with personalized alpha peak frequency prior to rTMS. In the second set, electrical brain activity is modulated before or during rTMS in order to stimulate the DLPFC in optimal conditions. Brain activity modulation may be obtained by transcranial direct current stimulation (\"tDCS rTMS\") or EEG-biofeedack (\"EEG-biofeedback rTMS\").", "pages": "046009"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Relieving pain in rheumatology patients: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a developing approach.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19906559", "authors": ["P\u00e9rocheau, D", "Laroche, F", "Perrot, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme", "abstract": "Interactive rTMS studies have various limitations, notably their exploratory character on a small sample of patients.

This period of EMG silence is referred to as the silent period (SP). The duration of SP shows intersubject variability and reflects the integrity of cortical and corticospinal pathways. A non-invasive technique for assessing the duration of SP is the combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with EMG. Utilizing TMS-EMG, several studies have reported on the shortening or lengthening of SP in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. However, cortical, corticospinal and peripheral components are difficult to disentangle from EMG alone. Here, we use the multimodal neuroimaging technique of TMS-EMG combined with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recording to further examine the cortical origin of SP and the cortical oscillatory activity that underlies SP genesis. We demonstrate that the duration of SP is related to the temporal characteristics of the cortical reactivity and the power of delta to alpha oscillations in both local and remote areas ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulation site, and beta oscillations locally. We illustrate that, compared to EMG, the EEG indices of the SP provide additional information about the brain dynamics and propose that the EEG measures of SP may be used in future clinical and research investigations to more precisely delineate the mechanisms underlying inhibitory impairments.", "pages": "046009"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "The Painfulness of Active, but not Sham, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Decreases Rapidly Over Time: Results From the Double-Blind Phase of the OPT-TMS Trial.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "21440574", "authors": ["Borckardt, JJ", "Nahas, ZH", "Teal, J", "Lisanby, SH", "McDonald, WM", "Avery, D", "Durkalski, V", "Pavlicova, M", "Long, JM", "Sackeim, HA", "George, MS"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "In this study, we investigated age and hemispheric differences in transcallosal inhibition (TCI) in the context of active contraction using the ipsilateral silent period (iSP).
