Six patients (3F, mean age 62 years) with mild-moderate PD (mean disease duration 6 years, UPDRS-off 13, UPDRS-on 3, H&Y stage 2, daily levodopa dosage 450 mg) were studied off and on levodopa on separate days. Paired TMS pulses at resting motor threshold with an inter-stimulus interval of 1.5 ms were given over the hand area of the motor cortex for 20 min at 0.2 Hz. Single-pulse motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and visually cued simple reaction time (SRT) were measured before and after iTMS. When on levodopa, MEP amplitude increased to 278+/-36% of baseline (p<0.01), and when off levodopa to 157+/-13% of baseline (p=0.02). All patients showed a significantly greater increase in MEP amplitude when on levodopa than off levodopa (p=0.01). SRT was reduced to 95% baseline after iTMS off levodopa (p=0.02), but did not change on levodopa. These findings indicate that motor cortex plasticity to iTMS is preserved in mild-moderate PD. The effects of this spike-timing-related TMS protocol on cortical excitability were consistent and were enhanced by levodopa. The results support the important role of dopamine in regulating synaptic plasticity and justify a larger crossover study to assess the therapeutic effects of iTMS in PD.", "pages": "29-32"}, {"volume": "448", "title": "Improvement of visual scanning after DC brain polarization of parietal cortex in stroke patients with spatial neglect.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18952147", "authors": ["Ko, MH", "Han, SH", "Park, SH", "Seo, JH", "Kim, YH"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that transcranial direct current (DC) brain polarization can modulate cortical excitability in the human brain.

Focal hand dystonia (FHD) is a movement disorder characterized by a loss of surround inhibition. In order to explain the deficit in surround inhibition induced by volitional movement in FHD patients, we examined the inhibitory circuit activated by afferent stimulation at \"long latency\". We studied 14 patients (age 48.9+/-13.2 years, 3 females, 11 males) with idiopathic task-related FHD. To measure long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the affected hemisphere for FHD patients and to the dominant hemisphere for 17 healthy volunteers. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded over abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) during rest and during voluntary phasic flexion of the second digit. Subjects were given electrical stimulation to either their fifth digit (homotopic to ADM, heterotopic to FDI) or their second digit (heterotopic to FDI, homotopic to ADM) at twice sensory perceptual threshold 180 ms prior to TMS application. Additionally, F-waves were recorded from ADM. At rest, we found a significant decrease in ADM MEP amplitudes with both homotopic and heterotopic stimulation compared to the corresponding non-stimulated trials. There was a trend toward less LAI in FHD patients. During movement, LAI was significantly decreased in both patients and controls. There was no significant group effect. The results for LAI in FDI were similar to those from ADM. F-wave area in ADM was greater during movement for both homo- and heterotopic stimulation. We found no difference in F-wave area between patients and healthy volunteers. Our results indicate that LAI is unlikely to be an underlying mechanism that contributes to the generation of normal surround inhibition in healthy volunteers or in the disruption of surround inhibition in FHD.", "pages": "29-32"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Stroke rehabilitation: strategies to enhance motor recovery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15193779", "authors": ["O'Dell, MW", "Lin, CC", "Harrison, V"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Annual review of medicine", "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that the brain can remodel after stroke, primarily through synaptogenesis. Task-specific and repetitive exercise appear to be key factors in promoting synaptogenesis and are central elements in rehabilitation of motor weakness following stroke. Expert medical management ensures a patient is well enough to participate in rehabilitation with minimal distractions due to pain or depression. Contraint-induced motor therapy and body-weight-supported ambulation are forms of exercise that \"force use\" of an impaired upper extremity. Technologies now in common use include robotics, functional electrical stimulation, and, to a lesser degree, transcranial magnetic stimulation and virtual reality. The data on pharmacological interventions are mixed but encouraging; it is hoped such treatments will directly stimulate brain tissue to recovery. Mitigation of factors preventing movement, such as spasticity, might also play a role. Research evaluating these motor recovery strategies finds them generally good at the movement level but somewhat less robust when looking at functional performance. It remains unclear whether inconsistent evidence for functional improvement is a matter of poor treatment efficacy or insensitive outcome measures.", "pages": "29-32"}, {"volume": "447", "title": "Differential modulatory effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on a facial expression go-no-go task in males and females.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "10835434", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Rocha, RR", "da Silva, MT", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The ability to recognize facial expressions has been shown to be different between males and females.

Fourteen healthy subjects were exposed to a facial expression go-no-go task while they received two different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the left temporal cortex (with cathodal stimulation of the right temporal cortex) and sham tDCS. The order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. During each stimulation session (after 5 min of stimulation), subjects underwent a go-no-go task. The results showed that women had significantly more correct answers when compared to men (p=0.03) that was independent of condition of stimulation and valence of figures.

This phenomenon, known as the Troxler effect, has been largely attributed to adaptation of neurons responding to peripheral targets. Here, we hypothesized that perceptual disappearance might result from degeneration of feedback from attention-related cortical areas to early visual areas and that visual transients disrupt the feedback loop sustaining low-level signals and thereby trigger perceptual fading. We examined this hypothesis by briefly disrupting the functions of attention-related regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The hypothesis predicted that temporary disruption of IPS would trigger perceptual disappearances. We measured perceptual disappearance using a task in which participants were asked to discriminate the presence or absence (fading) of a peripheral green target immediately after a TMS pulse. On one half of the trials, the target remained on the screen until the end of a trial, and on the other half of the trials, it gradually faded. The results of this experiment show that brief disruption of the IPS with a single pulse TMS is sufficient to trigger perceptual disappearance. TMS over the IPS resulted in a fewer reports of continuous percepts (i.e., more fading) without changes in the perception of physically fading stimuli. Our control experiment shows the loss of sensitivity is not caused by suppression of microsaccades in response to the sound produced by TMS. This study supports the idea that conscious visual perception requires a coupling between the early visual areas representing sensory data and the parietal areas subserving spatial localization functions.", "pages": "29-32"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the prefrontal cortex enhances complex verbal associative thought.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "15862218", "authors": ["Cerruti, C", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "The remote associates test (RAT) is a complex verbal task with associations to both creative thought and general intelligence. RAT problems require not only lateral associations and the internal production of many words but a convergent focus on a single answer. Complex problem-solving of this sort may thus require both substantial verbal processing and strong executive function capacities. Previous studies have provided evidence that verbal task performance can be enhanced by noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS modulates excitability of neural tissue depending on the polarity of the current. The after-effects of this modulation may have effects on task performance if the task examined draws on the modulated region. Studies of verbal cognition have focused largely on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3 of the 10-20 EEG system) as a region of interest. We planned to assess whether modulating excitability at F3 could affect complex verbal abilities. In Experiment 1 (anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation over F3 with the reference electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region), we found a significant overall effect of stimulation condition on RAT performance. Post hoc tests showed an increase in performance after anodal stimulation (1 mA) compared to sham (p = .025) and to cathodal stimulation (p = .038). In Experiment 2 (either anodal stimulation at F3 or separately at its homologue F4), we replicated the anodal effect of the first study, but also showed that anodal stimulation of F4 had no effect on RAT performance. These data provide evidence that anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can improve performance on a complex verbal problem-solving task believed to require significant executive function capacity.", "pages": "29-32"}, {"volume": "586", "title": "A common polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) modulates human cortical plasticity and the response to rTMS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 23", "pmid": "15537994", "authors": ["Cheeran, B", "Talelli, P", "Mori, F", "Koch, G", "Suppa, A", "Edwards, M", "Houlden, H", "Bhatia, K", "Greenwood, R", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "The brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) is one of many genes thought to influence synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and shows a common single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) in the normal population that is associated with differences in hippocampal volume and episodic memory. It is also thought to influence possible synaptic changes in motor cortex following a simple motor learning task. Here we extend these studies by using new non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) techniques that directly test the excitability and plasticity of neuronal circuits in human motor cortex in subjects at rest. We investigated whether the susceptibility to TMS probes of plasticity is significantly influenced by the BDNF polymorphism. Val66Met carriers were matched with Val66Val individuals and tested on the following protocols: continuous and intermittent theta burst TMS; median nerve paired associative stimulation; and homeostatic plasticity in the TDCS/1 Hz rTMS model. The response of Met allele carriers differed significantly in all protocols compared with the response of Val66Val individuals. We suggest that this is due to the effect of BNDF on the susceptibility of synapses to undergo LTP/LTD. The circuits tested here are implicated in the pathophysiology of movement disorders such as dystonia and are being assessed as potential new targets in the treatment of stroke. Thus the polymorphism may be one factor that influences the natural response of the brain to injury and disease.", "pages": "29-32"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "Abnormal short latency afferent inhibition in early Alzheimer's disease: a transcranial magnetic demonstration.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "7519144", "authors": ["Nardone, R", "Bergmann, J", "Kronbichler, M", "Kunz, A", "Klein, S", "Caleri, F", "Tezzon, F", "Ladurner, G", "Golaszewski, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to involve several different mechanisms, the most consistent of which is an impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission; however, there is controversy about its relevance at the early stage of disease.
