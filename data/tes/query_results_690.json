MSTIM was delivered to 12 healthy subjects for 20 min using a therapeutic stimulation device (Swisswing BMR 2000). Frequencies of 10 and 25 Hz were tested in separate sessions, and for control additionally the foot sole was stimulated at 25 Hz. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after single (recruitment curves) and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded from FDI and APB muscles of the right hand. TMS assessments were carried out at baseline (T0), immediately after (T1), 30 min (T2), 1 h (T3) and 2 h (T4) after end of MSTIM. After MSTIM with 25 Hz, MEP recruitment curves were increased at all post-stimulation assessments in both muscles. The most significant effect was achieved at T3 (1 h). Intracortical inhibition was decreased within the first hour, while intracortical facilitation was increased at all post-stimulation assessments. No significant effects were found following MSTIM with 10 Hz and following foot vibration. We conclude that 20 min MSTIM with a frequency of 25 Hz induces outlasting plastic changes in the primary motor cortex. Paired-pulse stimulation further confirms that intrinsic intracortical mechanisms are involved in these changes. Spinal adaptation could be excluded (F-wave assessments). These results could be of relevance for hemiplegic patients with motor deficits, to improve the rehabilitation outcome with vibration exercise in combination with motor training.", "pages": "3051-9"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Mechanisms of magnetic stimulation of central nervous system neurons.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "21455288", "authors": ["Pashut, T", "Wolfus, S", "Friedman, A", "Lavidor, M", "Bar-Gad, I", "Yeshurun, Y", "Korngreen, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a stimulation method in which a magnetic coil generates a magnetic field in an area of interest in the brain. This magnetic field induces an electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The spatial distribution of the induced electric field is determined by the geometry and location of the coil relative to the brain. Although TMS has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is still unknown. To address this problem we developed a numerical scheme enabling us to combine realistic magnetic stimulation (MS) with compartmental modeling of neurons with arbitrary morphology. The induced electric field for each location in space was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the electromagnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. In both peripheral and central neurons, MS amplitude required for action potential generation was inversely proportional to the square of the diameter of the stimulated compartment. Due to the importance of the fiber's diameter, magnetic stimulation of CNS neurons depolarized the soma followed by initiation of an action potential in the initial segment of the axon. Passive dendrites affect this process primarily as current sinks, not sources. The simulations predict that neurons with low current threshold are more susceptible to magnetic stimulation. Moreover, they suggest that MS does not directly trigger dendritic regenerative mechanisms. These insights into the mechanism of MS may be relevant for the design of multi-intensity TMS protocols, may facilitate the construction of magnetic stimulators, and may aid the interpretation of results of TMS of the CNS.", "pages": "3051-9"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Excitability changes at brainstem and cortical levels in blind subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "10588751", "authors": ["Orhan, EK", "Yayla, V", "Cebeci, Z", "Baslo, MB", "Oval\u0131, T", "\u00d6ge, AE"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study was designed to search potential changes in trigemino-facial system in blind subjects by the use of relatively well-established electrophysiological methods.

This involvement of ipsilateral M1 is asymmetric, such that the left M1 is more involved in motor control with the left hand than the right M1 in movements with the right hand. This suggests that the left hemisphere is specialized for movement control of either hand, although previous experiments tested mostly right-handed participants. In contrast, research on hemispheric asymmetries of ipsilateral M1 involvement in left-handed participants is relatively scarce. In the present study, left- and right-handed participants performed complex unimanual movements, whereas TMS was used to disrupt the activity of ipsilateral M1 in accordance with a \"virtual lesion\" approach. For right-handed participants, more disruptions were induced when TMS was applied over the dominant (left) M1. For left-handed participants, two subgroups could be distinguished, such that one group showed more disruptions when TMS was applied over the nondominant (left) M1, whereas the other subgroup showed more disruptions when the dominant (right) M1 was stimulated. This indicates that functional asymmetries of M1 involvement during ipsilateral movements are influenced by both hand dominance as well as left hemisphere specialization. We propose that the functional asymmetries in ipsilateral M1 involvement during unimanual movements are primarily attributable to asymmetries in the higher-order areas, although the contribution of transcallosal pathways and ipsilateral projections cannot be completely ruled out.", "pages": "3051-9"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): potential progress for language improvement in aphasia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2860322", "authors": ["Galletta, EE", "Rao, PR", "Barrett, AM"], "year": "", "journal": "Topics in stroke rehabilitation", "abstract": "A common feature of human existence is the ability to reverse decisions after they are made but before they are implemented. This cognitive control process, termed response inhibition, refers to the ability to inhibit an action once initiated and has been localized to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) based on functional imaging and brain lesion studies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that can facilitate as well as impair cortical function. To explore whether response inhibition can be improved through rIFG electrical stimulation, we administered focal tDCS before subjects performed the stop signal task (SST), which measures response inhibition. Notably, activation of the rIFG by unilateral anodal stimulation significantly improved response inhibition, relative to a sham condition, whereas the same tDCS protocol did not affect response time in the go trials of the SST and in a control task. Furthermore, the SST was not affected by tDCS at a control site, the right angular gyrus. Our results are the first demonstration of response inhibition improvement with brain stimulation over rIFG and further confirm the rIFG involvement in this task.
