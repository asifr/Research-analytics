Brain research protocols", "abstract": "The purpose of this method is to establish a single motor unit recording technique to study the differential activation of corticospinal volleys by various types of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is performed with various coil orientations over the hand or leg motor areas and surface EMG, and single motor unit recordings are made either from the studied hand or leg muscle. Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) is also performed over the motor cortex as well as at the foramen magnum level to determine the latency of D waves. The intensity of stimulation is set just above the motor threshold for each type of stimulation. This method makes it possible to activate some I volleys (especially I1 and I3 waves) preferentially, if not selectively, from the hand and leg motor areas. The obtained results accord well with recent epidural recording studies, which lends support to the validity of this method.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Sham TMS: intracerebral measurement of the induced electrical field and the induction of motor-evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11274658", "authors": ["Lisanby, SH", "Gutman, D", "Luber, B", "Schroeder, C", "Sackeim, HA"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Testing the therapeutic potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in controlled trials requires a valid sham condition. Sham TMS is typically administered by tilting the coil 45--90 degrees off the scalp, with one or two wings of the coil touching the scalp. Lack of cortical effects has not been verified. We compared sham manipulations in their thresholds for eliciting motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in human volunteers and in intracerebral measurements of voltage induced in the prefrontal cortex of a rhesus monkey. Three types of sham (one-wing 45 degrees and 90 degrees and two-wing 90 degrees tilt) induced much lower voltage in the brain than active TMS (67--73% reductions). However, the two-wing 45 degrees sham induced values just 24% below active TMS. This sham was about half as potent in inducing MEPs over the motor cortex as active TMS. Some sham TMS conditions produce substantial cortical stimulation, making it critical to carefully select the sham manipulation for clinical trials.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "The transcranial magnetic stimulation motor threshold depends on the distance from coil to underlying cortex: a replication in healthy adults comparing two methods of assessing the distance to cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11274657", "authors": ["McConnell, KA", "Nahas, Z", "Shastri, A", "Lorberbaum, JP", "Kozel, FA", "Bohning, DE", "George, MS"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a handheld electrified copper coil against the scalp produces a powerful and rapidly oscillating magnetic field, which in turn induces electrical currents in the brain. The amount of electrical energy needed for TMS to induce motor movement (called the motor threshold [MT]), varies widely across individuals. The intensity of TMS is dosed relative to the MT. Kozel et al observed in a depressed cohort that MT increases as a function of distance from coil to cortex. This article examines this relationship in a healthy cohort and compares the two methods of assessing distance to cortex. Seventeen healthy adults had their TMS MT determined and marked with a fiducial. Magnetic resonance images showed the fiducials marking motor cortex, allowing researchers to measure distance from scalp to motor and prefontal cortex using two methods: 1) measuring a line from scalp to the nearest cortex and 2) sampling the distance from scalp to cortex of two 18-mm-square areas. Confirming Kozel's previous finding, we observe that motor threshold increases as distance to motor cortex increased for both methods of measuring distance and that no significant correlation exists between MT and prefontal cortex distance. Distance from TMS coil to motor cortex is an important determinant of MT in healthy and depressed adults. Distance to prefontal cortex is not correlated with MT, raising questions about the common practice of dosing prefontal stimulation using MT determined over motor cortex.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation during isometric and dynamic masseter muscle contraction in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11269872", "authors": ["McMillan, AS", "Graven-Nielsen, T", "Romaniello, A", "Svensson, P"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Archives of oral biology", "abstract": "The facilitation of muscle motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated convincingly during both isometric and dynamic activity in the limbs but not in the jaw muscles. An experimental design involving TMS, surface electromyography and controlled muscle-activity was employed to investigate the motor response of the human masseter during voluntary isometric and dynamic voluntary conditions. During the isometric condition, an increase in muscle facilitation resulted in a progressive increase in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude that was consistently greater on the side contralateral to that subjected to TMS (P < 0.05). No difference in MEP amplitude or laterality of response was revealed for the two dynamic conditions. The sample size may have been too small to reveal any differences. The modulation of MEPs during isometric activity was probably due to cortical and brainstem mechanisms. Putative variation in masseter MEPs during dynamic conditions cannot be discounted.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Current trends in electroencephalography.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11262735", "authors": ["Blume, WT"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Current opinion in neurology", "abstract": "Several recent articles re-emphasize the value of clinical electrophysiology: in localizing epileptogenesis, predicting effectiveness of epilepsy surgery, and disclosing a mechanism of benign Rolandic epilepsy of childhood.A review of the role of EEG in the diagnosis of epilepsy indicated that epileptiform activity will appear in 50% of initial awake recordings of adults with epilepsy and in 85% of subjects undergoing two recordings. This contrasts with the appearance of spikes in only 4 of 1000 normal persons. Several studies focused on the value of electroencephalography in extratemporal epilepsy: 62% of patients with neocortical epilepsy had at least one localizing ictal EEG; occipital and temporal neocortical seizures were localized in a greater proportion than frontal or parietal attacks. Interictal spikes, if unifocal, always arose from the epileptogenic region in a study of their seizure localizing value. Such congruence augured for better seizure control by focal resection in two studies reviewed herein. Studies indicating the value of interictal temporal lobe spikes and scalp-recorded seizures in lateralising a temporal seizure focus are reviewed. One study found EEG to be slightly more reliable for lateralization of temporal epileptogenesis than MRI. In patients with benign Rolandic seizures, enhanced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained from transcranial magnetic stimulation when this was applied 50-80 msec after electrical stimulation of the thumb whereas this interval inhibited the MEP in normal subjects. This suggests that afferent cutaneous input abnormally and synchronously activates a large population of sensory neurons; such activation is subsequently transmitted to the motor cortex to produce the focal spikes in this condition.Finally, advances in non-invasive technology have redefined and limited the need for invasive monitoring in children with intractable seizure disorders.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "Deconvolution of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) maps.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11261745", "authors": ["Bohning, DE", "He, L", "George, MS", "Epstein, CM"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method for local stimulation of cerebral cortex using a small coil's pulsed magnetic field. TMS response maps consist of measured responses to stimulations at points on a scalp-referenced grid and are used to study the topography of the brain's inhibitory and excitatory response. Because the magnetic field distributions of stimulation coils are 1-2 centimeters wide and 2-3 centimeters long, and the induced electric fields are even broader, the resolution of TMS maps is limited and the actual region of cortical stimulation is poorly defined. To better characterize the activation pattern, a practical mathematical procedure was developed for deconvolving a spherical model approximation of the coil's induced electric field distribution (here measured in a phantom) from the TMS response maps. This procedure offers an integrated, internally consistent method for processing TMS response maps to estimate the spatial distribution of motor cortex activations and inhibitions.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive neuroscience.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11252771", "authors": ["Walsh, V", "Cowey, A"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Nature reviews.
