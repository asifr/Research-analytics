This requires engagement of the brain substrates of selective attention and the concurrent disengagement of brain substrates of orienting toward changes in the environment. In the present study, we attempted to modulate activation of cortical substrates of attention during learning by physiological intervention, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To effect adversarial modulation, we applied anodal stimulation directed toward left intraparietal sulcus/superior parietal cortex (IPS/SPL; a substrate of selective attention) and cathodal stimulation directed toward right inferior parietal cortex (IPL; a substrate of orienting). Such stimulation during study of verbal materials led to superior subsequent recognition memory relative to the opposite polarity of stimulation. To our knowledge, this is the first application of direct current stimulation to parietal regions implicated in different forms of attention in an oppositional manner in order to modulate learning in a verbal recognition memory task. Additionally, these results may have practical implications for the development of interventions to benefit persons with various types of attentional deficits.", "pages": "66-72"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Dissociating the role of prefrontal and premotor cortices in controlling inhibitory mechanisms during motor preparation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22262879", "authors": ["Duque, J", "Labruna, L", "Verset, S", "Olivier, E", "Ivry, RB"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Top-down control processes are critical to select goal-directed actions in flexible environments. In humans, these processes include two inhibitory mechanisms that operate during response selection: one is involved in solving a competition between different response options, the other ensures that a selected response is initiated in a timely manner. Here, we evaluated the role of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPF) of healthy subjects in these two forms of inhibition by using an innovative transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol combining repetitive TMS (rTMS) over PMd or LPF and a single pulse TMS (sTMS) over primary motor cortex (M1). sTMS over M1 allowed us to assess inhibitory changes in corticospinal excitability, while rTMS was used to produce transient disruption of PMd or LPF. We found that rTMS over LPF reduces inhibition associated with competition resolution, whereas rTMS over PMd decreases inhibition associated with response impulse control. These results emphasize the dissociable contributions of these two frontal regions to inhibitory control during motor preparation. The association of LPF with competition resolution is consistent with the role of this area in relatively abstract aspects of control related to goal maintenance, ensuring that the appropriate response is selected in a variable context. In contrast, the association of PMd with impulse control is consistent with the role of this area in more specific processes related to motor preparation and initiation.", "pages": "66-72"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "The promises and perils of non-invasive brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12713653", "authors": ["Heinrichs, JH"], "year": "", "journal": "International journal of law and psychiatry", "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation promises innovative experimental possibilities for psychology and neuroscience as well as new therapeutic and palliative measures in medicine.

While most issues in medical and research ethics such as informed consent, safety, and potential for misuse can be handled with manageable effort, the real promise of brain stimulation does raise one prominent moral worry: it may lay the foundation of reliable, precise and stable manipulations of the mind.

Here, we investigated the effects of tDCS on resting brain dynamics recorded by whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) pre- and up to 35 minutes post-tDCS or sham over the left primary motor cortex (M1) in healthy adults. Owing to superior temporal and spatial resolution of MEG, we sought to apply a robust, blind and data-driven analytic approach such as independent component analysis (ICA) and statistical clustering to these data to investigate potential neuroplastic effects of tDCS during resting state conditions. We found decreased alpha and increased gamma band power that outlasted the real tDCS stimulation period in a fronto-parietal motor network relative to sham. However, this method could not find differences between anodal and cathodal polarities of tDCS. These results suggest that tDCS over M1 modulates resting brain dynamics in a fronto-parietal motor network (that includes the stimulated location), indicative of within-network enhanced localized cortical processing.", "pages": "66-72"}]
