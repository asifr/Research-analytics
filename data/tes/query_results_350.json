However the attentional mechanisms subtending visual selection of different levels of information are poorly understood. The classical left hemisphere/local-right hemisphere/global dichotomy has been recently challenged by studies linking the asymmetry of activation in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) with the relative salience of the stimulus rather than with the local/global level. The present study aimed to assess hemispheric asymmetry in local-global and salience-based selection in hierarchical stimuli by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To this end, tDCS has been applied to the PPC of both the hemispheres. Our data revealed that tDCS did affect the selection of the target on the basis of its relative salience in a manner that depended on the tDCS polarity applied to the two hemispheres. This result is in line with previous findings that the left PPC is critically involved in attention for low-salience stimuli in the presence of high-salience distractor information, while right PPC is involved in attending to more salient stimuli. Hemispheric asymmetries were also found in local/global selection. Overall the results suggest that neural activation in the PPC is related to both the salience and the level of stimulus representations mediating responses to hierarchical stimuli. The comparison of the results from Experiments 1 and 2 in local/global-based selection suggests that the effect of stimulation could be completely opposite depending on subtle differences in demands of attentional control (sustained attention vs task switching).", "pages": "850-60"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Simultaneous application of slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation and theta burst stimulation prolongs continuous theta burst stimulation-induced suppression of corticomotor excitability in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "22697254", "authors": ["Doeltgen, SH", "McAllister, SM", "Ridding, MC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess whether the simultaneous application of slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the neuroplastic response to transcranial magnetic theta burst stimulation.

In addition, the electroencephalographic power spectra of slow and fast delta, and theta frequency bands recorded over the motor cortex were analyzed prior to and up to 5 min following each intervention. There was longer-lasting motor evoked potential suppression following the simultaneous application of continuous theta burst stimulation and slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation compared with when continuous theta burst stimulation was applied alone. Slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation applied alone did not modulate the motor evoked potential amplitude. No significant changes in spectral power were observed following slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation.

We evaluated the effects of 1- and 3-h hypoxia on motor corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition, and cortical voluntary activation (VA) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS to the quadriceps cortex area and femoral nerve electrical stimulations were performed in 14 healthy subjects. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs at 50-100% maximal voluntary contraction; MVC), recruitment curves (MEPs at 30-100% maximal stimulator power output at 50% MVC), cortical silent periods (CSP), and VA were measured in normoxia and after 1 (n = 12) or 3 (n = 10) h of hypoxia (Fi(O(2)) = 0.12). One-hour hypoxia did not modify any parameters of corticospinal excitability but reduced slightly VA, probably due to the repetition of contractions 1 h apart (96 \u00b1 4% vs. 94 \u00b1 4%; P = 0.03). Conversely, 3-h hypoxia significantly increased 1) MEPs of the quadriceps muscles at all force levels (+26 \u00b1 14%, +24 \u00b1 12%, and +27 \u00b1 17% at 50, 75, and 100% MVC, respectively; P = 0.01) and stimulator power outputs (e.g., +21 \u00b1 14% at 70% maximal power), and 2) CSP at all force levels (+20 \u00b1 18%, +18 \u00b1 19%, and +14 \u00b1 22% at 50, 75, and 100% MVC, respectively; P = 0.02) and stimulator power outputs (e.g., +9 \u00b1 8% at 70% maximal power), but did not modify VA (98 \u00b1 1% vs. 97 \u00b1 3%; P = 0.42). These data demonstrate a time-dependent hypoxia-induced increase in motor corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition, without changes in VA.

We have been developing a noninvasive transcranial focal electrical stimulation with our novel tripolar concentric ring electrodes as an alternative/complementary therapy for seizure control. In this study we demonstrate the effect of focal stimulation on behavioral seizure activity induced by two successive pentylenetetrazole administrations in rats. Seizure onset latency, time of the first behavioral change, duration of seizure, and maximal seizure severity score were studied and compared for focal stimulation treated (n = 9) and control groups (n = 10). First, we demonstrate that no significant difference was found in behavioral activity for focal stimulation treated and control groups after the first pentylenetetrazole administration. Next, comparing first and second pentylenetetrazole administrations, we demonstrate there was a significant change in behavioral activity (time of the first behavioral change) in both groups that was not related to focal stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate focal stimulation provoking a significant change in seizure onset latency, duration of seizure, and maximal seizure severity score. We believe that these results, combined with our previous reports, suggest that transcranial focal stimulation may have an anticonvulsant effect.", "pages": "850-60"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Prefrontal control during a semantic decision task that involves idiom comprehension: a transcranial direct current stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "22687558", "authors": ["Sela, T", "Ivry, RB", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Language processing and comprehension can be understood in terms of both linguistic and non-linguistic processes. To make a decision regarding the meaning of complex linguistic inputs such as idiomatic expressions, one has to perform multiple complex cognitive operations such as prediction, selection and inhibition. In the current study, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to test the hypotheses that (I) a prefrontal cognitive control network is involved in directing decisions required for the comprehension of idioms, and (II) that this prefrontal control may be biased by motivational mechanisms. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two stimulation groups (LH anodal/RH cathodal or RH anodal/LH Cathodal). Over a one-week interval, participants were tested twice, completing a semantic decision task after either receiving active or sham stimulation. The semantic decision task required participants to judge the relatedness of an idiom and a target word, with the idiom being predictable or not. The target word was either figuratively related, literally related, or unrelated to the idiom. Each participant also completed a trait motivation questionnaire and a control task. After DC stimulation, a general deceleration in reaction times to targets was found. In addition, the results indicate that the neural enhancement of a left lateralized prefrontal network improved performance when participants had to make decisions to figurative targets of highly predictable idioms, whereas the neural enhancement of the opposite network improved participants' performance to literal targets of unpredictable idioms. These effects were more pronounced in individuals rated as being most sensitive to reward likelihood.

Changes in brain activations are one presumed contributor to WM decline in the healthy aging population. In particular, neuroimaging studies show that when older adults perform WM tasks there tends to be greater bilateral frontal activity than in younger adults. We hypothesized that stimulating the prefrontal cortex in healthy older adults would improve WM performance. To test this hypothesis we employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a neurostimulation technique in which small amounts of electrical current are applied to the scalp with the intent of modulating the activity in underlying neurons. Across three testing sessions we applied sham stimulation or anodal tDCS to the left (F3) or right (F4) prefrontal cortex to healthy older adults as they performed trials of verbal and visual 2-back WM tasks. Surprisingly, tDCS was uniformly beneficial across site and WM task, but only in older adults with more education. In the less educated group, tDCS provided no benefit to verbal or visual WM performance. We interpret these findings as evidence for differential frontal recruitment as a function of strategy when older adults perform WM tasks.", "pages": "850-60"}, {"volume": "295", "title": "Auditory cortex stimulation to suppress tinnitus: mechanisms and strategies.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22683861", "authors": ["Zhang, J"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Hearing research", "abstract": "Brain stimulation is an important method used to modulate neural activity and suppress tinnitus. Several auditory and non-auditory brain regions have been targeted for stimulation. This paper reviews recent progress on auditory cortex (AC) stimulation to suppress tinnitus and its underlying neural mechanisms and stimulation strategies. At the same time, the author provides his opinions and hypotheses on both animal and human models. The author also proposes a medial geniculate body (MGB)-thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)-Gating mechanism to reflect tinnitus-related neural information coming from upstream and downstream projection structures. The upstream structures include the lower auditory brainstem and midbrain structures. The downstream structures include the AC and certain limbic centers. Both upstream and downstream information is involved in a dynamic gating mechanism in the MGB together with the TRN. When abnormal gating occurs at the thalamic level, the spilled-out information interacts with the AC to generate tinnitus. The tinnitus signals at the MGB-TRN-Gating may be modulated by different forms of stimulations including brain stimulation. Each stimulation acts as a gain modulator to control the level of tinnitus signals at the MGB-TRN-Gate. This hypothesis may explain why different types of stimulation can induce tinnitus suppression. Depending on the tinnitus etiology, MGB-TRN-Gating may be different in levels and dynamics, which cause variability in tinnitus suppression induced by different gain controllers. This may explain why the induced suppression of tinnitus by one type of stimulation varies across individual patients.", "pages": "850-60"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "The importance of timing in segregated theta phase-coupling for cognitive performance.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "22683259", "authors": ["Polan\u00eda, R", "Nitsche, MA", "Korman, C", "Batsikadze, G", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Functional cortical circuits for central executive functions have been shown to emerge by theta (~6 Hz) phase-coupling of distant cortical areas.

Vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscle responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex (motor evoked potentials, MEPs) and electrical stimulation of the descending tracts (cervicomedullary evoked potentials, CMEPs) were recorded every 3 min from nine subjects during 30 min of cycling at 75% of maximum workload (W(max)), and every minute during subsequent exercise at 105% of W(max) until subjective task failure. Responses were also measured during nonfatiguing control bouts at 80% and 110% of W(max) prior to sustained exercise. There were no significant changes in MEPs or CMEPs (P > 0.05) during the sustained cycling exercise. These results suggest that, in contrast to sustained single-joint contractions, sustained cycling exercise does not increase the excitability of motor cortical neurons. The contrasting corticospinal responses to the two modes of exercise may be due to differences in their associated systemic physiological consequences.", "pages": "850-60"}]
