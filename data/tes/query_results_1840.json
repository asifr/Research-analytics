Furthermore, most studies concur on a facilitation of the non-stimulated contralateral M1. Little is known, however, about the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects. In 11 healthy volunteers, we stimulated the left M1 for 15 min with 1 Hz-rTMS of 115% RMT. Before, immediately after, and 30 min after the rTMS train, we examined short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI; interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 and 4 ms), intracortical facilitation (ICF; ISI 10 ms), and short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF; ISI 1.5 ms) with established paired-pulse protocols. Mean unconditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and RMT were also measured. Two sessions were run at least 1 week apart, in one excitability of the stimulated M1 was tested, in the other one excitability of the non-stimulated M1. rTMS led to the expected reduction of MEP amplitude of the stimulated M1, which was significant only immediately after the rTMS train. rTMS increased MEP amplitude of the non-stimulated M1, which lasted for at least 30 min. RMT, SICI, ICF and SICF did not show any significant change in either M1, except for a long lasting increase of SICF in the non-stimulated M1. In conclusion, the MEP increase in the non-stimulated M1 lasted longer than the MEP decrease in the stimulated M1. Only the long-lasting MEP increase was associated with a specific change in intracortical excitability (increase in SICF). Modulation of motor cortical inhibition did not play a role in explaining the rTMS induced changes in MEP amplitude.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "Age reduces cortical reciprocal inhibition in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16307241", "authors": ["Hortob\u00e1gyi, T", "del Olmo, MF", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

A widely observed age-related adaptation is the heightened activation of the antagonist muscles during voluntary movements. We examined the possibility that age also modifies cortical reciprocal inhibition. In young (age 27, n = 6) and old (age 73, n = 6) adults a mild conditioning electrical stimulus was delivered to the median nerve at the elbow. The test stimulus, delivered by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 1-ms increments between 11 and 24 ms after the electrical conditioning stimulus, evoked motor potentials (MEP) in the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR). The absolute TMS intensity, expressed as the percent of stimulator output, used to produce 1-mV control MEPs in the ECR was similar in young (mean 58.5, standard deviation +/-12.8%) and old adults (60.3+/-20.3%, P = 0.855). The size of the control MEP in the ECR was also similar in young (0.98+/-0.10 mV) and old subjects (0.90+/-0.14 mV, P = 0.686). The age by conditioning interval interaction (P = 0.001) showed that the MEPs in the ECR were significantly depressed at 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 ms (range 55.5--65.9% of control, all P < 0.05) compared with control value of 100% and with old adults who showed no depression. The MEPs remained at control level in the FCR and were also unaffected in the first dorsal interosseus. These data confirm the existence of cortical reciprocal inhibition reported previously in young humans and show that age reduces this inhibition similarly to the previously reported reduction of spinal reciprocal inhibition reported in old adults. Activation of agonist and antagonist muscle pairs are most likely organized around a dual system of cortically and spinally mediated reciprocal inhibition that is altered by age. The data also indicate the need to use age-matched control subjects when comparing individuals with abnormalities resulting from disorders that occur at an old age.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Short-latency afferent inhibition during selective finger movement.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16284755", "authors": ["Voller, B", "St Clair Gibson, A", "Dambrosia, J", "Pirio Richardson, S", "Lomarev, M", "Dang, N", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

At rest, excitability in the motor cortex (M1) is inhibited at about 20 ms after electric stimulation of a peripheral nerve [short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI)]. We sought to determine whether SAI changes during selective index finger movement. Effects were measured by the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation in two functionally distinct target muscles of the hand [abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM), first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI)]. An increase in SAI in the ADM during index finger movement compared to at rest could help explain the genesis of SI. Electrical stimulation was applied to either the little finger (homotopic for ADM, heterotopic for FDI) or the index finger (heterotopic for ADM, homotopic for FDI). During index finger movement, homotopic SAI was present only in the ADM, and the effect of peripheral stimulation was greater when there was less co-activation. Heterotopic SAI found at rest disappeared with movement. We conclude that during movement, homotopic SAI on the muscle in the surround of the intended movement may contribute to SI.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Excitability of the pathways mediating the startle reaction before execution of a voluntary movement.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16273394", "authors": ["Kumru, H", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Studies with transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation have shown a progressive increase of motor cortex excitability beginning at about 80 ms before the onset of electromyographic (EMG) activity in a voluntary movement. We studied whether a similar increase in excitability occurs in subcortical motor tracts before execution of a ballistic movement. In ten healthy volunteers, we examined the effects of a startling auditory stimulus (SAS) applied at various intervals following the imperative signal (IS) in a reaction time task experiment. We hypothesized that, if the excitability of the reticulospinal tract increases before onset of muscle activity, there would be a corresponding change in the size of the startle response elicited either in muscles responding to the SAS, the orbicularis oculi (OOc) and sternocleidomastoid (SCM), or in the agonist muscle for the reaction. A SAS was applied at intervals of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ms after IS in a reaction time task paradigm in which subjects had to perform a ballistic movement of wrist flexion. We measured the size of the EMG bursts recorded in the OOc and the SCM, as well as the size of the first EMG burst in the wrist flexors (WF). Comparisons were done with data obtained in baseline trials, in which unexpected SAS of the same intensity were delivered without preparation, and control trials, in which subjects performed the same motor task with no SAS. The size of the averaged OOc, SCM, and WF were larger in trials with SAS than in baseline or control trials, with significant differences in the SCM and in the WF (p<0.05). However, there were no effects of time interval on the size of OOc, SCM, or WF (p>0.05). These results indicate that, in the execution of a ballistic movement, the excitability of the subcortical motor tracts activated by a SAS is similarly enhanced at the time of the IS and 100 ms afterwards, just before the onset of EMG activity. We conclude that, in contrast with the reported progressive increase of excitability in the corticospinal tract, the excitability of the tracts activated by a SAS do not change between the IS and the onset of EMG activity.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Transmission properties of bone conducted sound: measurements in cadaver heads.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16266160", "authors": ["Stenfelt, S", "Goode, RL"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "abstract": "In the past, only a few investigations have measured vibration at the cochlea with bone conduction stimulation: dry skulls were used in those investigations.

The stimulation was provided at 27 positions on the skull surface and two close to the cochlea; mechanical point impedance was measured at all positions. Cochlear promontory vibration levels in the three perpendicular directions were normally within 5 dB. With the stimulation applied on the ipsilateral side, the response decreased, and the accumulated phase increased, with distance between the cochlea and the excitation position. No significant changes were obtained when the excitations were on the contralateral side. In terms of vibration level, the best stimulation position is on the mastoid close to the cochlea; the worst is at the midline of the skull. The transcranial transmission was close to 0 dB for frequencies up to 700 Hz; above it decreased at 12 dB/decade. Wave transmission at the skull-base was found to be nondispersive at frequencies above 2 kHz whereas it altered with frequency at the cranial vault.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Parietal rTMS distorts the mental number line: simulating 'spatial' neglect in healthy subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "16260006", "authors": ["G\u00f6bel, SM", "Calabria, M", "Farn\u00e8, A", "Rossetti, Y"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Patients with left-sided visuospatial neglect, typically after damage to the right parietal lobe, show a systematic bias towards larger numbers when asked to bisect a numerical interval. This has been taken as further evidence for a spatial representation of numbers, perhaps akin to a mental number line with smaller numbers represented to the left and larger numbers to the right. Previously, contralateral neglect-like symptoms in physical line bisection have been induced in healthy subjects with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right posterior parietal lobe. Here we used rTMS over parietal and occipital sites in healthy subjects to investigate spatial representations in a number bisection task. Subjects were asked to name the midpoint of numerical intervals without calculating. On control trials subjects' behaviour was similar to performance reported in physical line bisection experiments. Subjects underestimated the midpoint of the numerical interval. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation produced representational neglect-like symptoms in number bisection when applied over right posterior parietal cortex (right PPC). Repetitive TMS over right PPC shifted the perceived midpoint of the numerical interval significantly to the right while occipital TMS had no effect on bisection performance. Our study therefore provides further evidence that subjects use spatial representations, perhaps akin to a mental number line, in basic numerical processing tasks. Furthermore, we showed that the right posterior parietal cortex is crucially involved in spatial representation of numbers.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation compared: does TES activate intracortical neuronal circuits?", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "16256428", "authors": ["Brocke, J", "Irlbacher, K", "Hauptmann, B", "Voss, M", "Brandt, SA"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To determine whether, and under which conditions, transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can activate similar neuronal structures of the human motor cortex, as indicated by electromyographic recordings.", "pages": "26-34"}, {"volume": "95", "title": "Corticospinal excitability is lower during rhythmic arm movement than during tonic contraction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16251263", "authors": ["Carroll, TJ", "Baldwin, ER", "Collins, DF", "Zehr, EP"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Focal TMS was performed on three subjects inducing a postero-anterior directed current (p-a), TES with postero-anteriorly (p-a) and latero-medially (l-m) oriented electrodes.
