We studied the relation between force and surface electromyography (sEMG) variables over a wide range of voluntary contraction strengths of biceps brachii (BIC) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM). The relation between force and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex was also assessed. The root mean square of sEMG and median frequency (Mf) of the sEMG power spectrum as well as the MEP area of ADM and BIC were calculated up to the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The root mean square of ADM and BIC increased with increasing force levels up to the MVC. The Mf of BIC increased with force levels up to 70% MVC after which it rapidly declined. The Mf of ADM peaked at 40% MVC to slowly decline thereafter. The MEP changes with force were similar to Mf changes. Thus, corticospinal output, as tested by the Mf and MEPs, does not parallel force increments across the contraction range. This decline, which is contingent on the relative contribution of motor unit recruitment and rate coding to force production in each muscle, may depend on reduced motoneurone responsiveness at high firing rates. We suggest that, under controlled conditions, the frequency content of the sEMG signal may be taken to indicate motor unit recruitment range. This information may improve the utility of the Mf to enable evaluation of voluntary activation under different conditions.", "pages": "3469-75"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Homeostatic plasticity in human motor cortex demonstrated by two consecutive sessions of paired associative stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "17553015", "authors": ["M\u00fcller, JF", "Orekhov, Y", "Liu, Y", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) underlie most models of learning and memory, but neural activity would grow or shrink in an uncontrolled manner, if not guarded by stabilizing mechanisms. The Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) rule proposes a sliding threshold for LTP/LTD induction: LTP induction becomes more difficult if neural activity was high previously. Here we tested if this form of homeostatic plasticity applies to the human motor cortex (M1) in vivo by examining the interactions between two consecutive sessions of paired associative stimulation (PAS). PAS consisted of repeated pairs of electrical stimulation of the right median nerve followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left M1. The first PAS session employed an interstimulus interval equalling the individual N20-latency of the median nerve somatosensory-evoked cortical potential plus 2 ms, N20-latency minus 5 ms, or a random alternation between these intervals, to induce an LTP-like increase in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle (PAS(LTP)), an LTD-like decrease (PAS(LTD)), or no change (PAS(Control)), respectively. The second PAS session 30 min later was always PAS(LTP). It induced an moderate LTP-like effect if conditioned by PAS(Control), which increased if conditioned by PAS(LTD), but decreased if conditioned by PAS(LTP). Effects on MEP amplitude induced by the second PAS session exhibited a negative linear correlation with those in the first PAS session. Because the two PAS sessions activate identical neuronal circuits, we conclude that 'homosynaptic-like' homeostatic mechanisms in accord with the BCM rule contribute to regulating plasticity in human M1.", "pages": "3469-75"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Success rate of motor evoked potentials for intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring: effects of age, lesion location, and preoperative neurologic deficits.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17545833", "authors": ["Chen, X", "Sterio, D", "Ming, X", "Para, DD", "Butusova, M", "Tong, T", "Beric, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation with myogenic motor evoked potential (MEP) recording was used for intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring in 341 consecutive \"high-risk\" neurosurgical or orthopedic procedures.

We tested whether an intervention of PAS consisting of 90 low-frequency (0.1-Hz) stimuli to the common peroneal nerve combined with suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces specific changes to the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in lower leg muscles if the afferent volley from peripheral stimulation is timed to arrive at the motor cortex after TMS-induced firing of corticospinal neurons. Unlike PAS in the hand, MEP facilitation in the leg was produced when sensory inputs were estimated to arrive at the motor cortex over a range of 15 to 90 ms after cortical stimulation. We examined whether this broad range of facilitation occurred as a result of prolonged subthreshold excitability of the motor cortex after a single pulse of suprathreshold TMS so that coincident excitation from sensory inputs arriving many milliseconds after TMS can occur. We found that significant facilitation of MEP responses (>200%) occurred when the motor cortex was conditioned with suprathreshold TMS tens of milliseconds earlier. Likewise, it was possible to induce strong MEP facilitation (85% at 60 min) when afferent inputs were directly paired with subthreshold TMS. We argue that in the leg motor cortex, facilitation of MEP responses from PAS occurred over a large range of interstimulus intervals as a result of the paired activation of sensory inputs with sustained, subthreshold activity of cortical neurons that follow a pulse of suprathreshold TMS.", "pages": "3469-75"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Asymmetric corticomotor excitability correlations in early Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "17523196", "authors": ["Wu, AD", "Petzinger, GM", "Lin, CH", "Kung, M", "Fisher, B"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "One hertz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex has been reported to increase activity in the motor cortex contralateral to stimulation, as evidenced by the elevated motor evoked potential on the corresponding hand muscle.

An aim of this study was to measure the change of oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin levels in the left motor cortex after 20 min of 1 Hz TMS over the right motor cortex. Subjects carried out a finger to thumb tapping task sequentially with six blocks of ten cycles (30 s on and 60 s off). One block was performed before TMS and five after TMS. The results show that the level of oxyhaemoglobin in the unstimulated cortex increased after TMS over the contralateral hemisphere and that the increase lasted 40 min after 1 Hz stimulation.

It has considerably more effect on the spatial distribution of the induced electric field, yielding differences of the order of 10% of the maximum induced field. Moreover the area affected by magnetic stimulation is slightly larger when we include fiber anisotropy in the calculations than in an isotropic model.

Active motor evoked potentials (MEP) and cortical silent period durations (CSP) were recorded, fitted with sigmoid curves, summarized as maximal MEP/CSP, maximal MEP/CSP slope, and intensity where MEP/CSP is half-maximal (MEP/CSP-Int50), and correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores (UPDRS).

For the less affected side, altered CE, as indexed by higher MEP or CSP-Int50 intensities, may contribute to early clinical symptoms. On the more affected side, increases in CE, indexed by shorter CSP, may account for a greater proportion of PD symptoms. These findings are consistent with an evolution of neurophysiologic correlates in early PD patients from a less to more symptomatic state.", "pages": "3469-75"}]
