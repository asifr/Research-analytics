Therefore, we were interested in learning whether it is possible to purposely modulate deafferentation-induced reorganization. Transient forearm deafferentation was induced by ischemic nerve block (INB) in healthy volunteers. The following five interventions were tested: INB alone; INB plus low-frequency (0.1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex ipsilateral to INB (INB+rTMSi); rTMSi alone; INB plus rTMS of the motor cortex contralateral to INB (INB+rTMSc); and rTMSc alone. Plastic changes in the motor cortex contralateral to deafferentation were probed with TMS, measuring motor threshold (MT), motor evoked-potential (MEP) size, and intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) to the biceps brachii muscle proximal to the level of deafferentation. INB alone induced a moderate increase in MEP size, which was significantly enhanced by INB+rTMSc but blocked by INB+rTMSi. INB alone had no effect on ICI or ICF, whereas INB+rTMSc reduced ICI and increased ICF, and conversely, INB+rTMSi deepened ICI and suppressed ICF. rTMSi and rTMSc alone were ineffective in changing any of these parameters. These findings indicate that the deafferented motor cortex becomes modifiable by inputs that are normally subthreshold for inducing changes in excitability. The deafferentation-induced plastic changes can be up-regulated by direct stimulation of the \"plastic\" cortex and likely via inhibitory projections down-regulated by stimulation of the opposite cortex. This modulation of cortical plasticity by noninvasive means might be used to facilitate plasticity when it is primarily beneficial or to suppress it when it is predominately maladaptive.", "pages": "1115-23"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation as an alternative to electroshock therapy in treatment resistant depressions.

For several years it has played an important part in measurements of the central motor conduction time (magnetically evoked potentials/MEP). Further technical and methodological developments, such as high-frequency (rapid rate TMS/rTMS) or triggered stimulation have led to broad scientific application of this method. Electric convulsive therapy (ECT) has proved its value in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, especially in pharmaco-resistant depression. The therapeutic mechanism is actually unclear. However, the generalised convulsive fit appears to be the precondition for the therapeutic effect. A disadvantage lies in the risk inherent in the necessary general anaesthesia and the possible side effects, such as transitory states of confusion and transient mnestic deficits. Bearing in mind the possibility that TMS could have the same effects as ECT due to stimulations below the convulsion threshold or to the direct or indirect stimulations of so-called disorder-specific key regions, several pilot studies and some controlled studies have been published during the past three years on its efficacy in depressive disorders. The results were reported on and critically evaluated. The results of this survey of the literature on the subject is that (r)TMS does not represent an alternative to ECT in the therapy of pharmaco-resistant depressions. Due to its slight and only transient antidepressive effect, (r)TMS is also, in our opinion, not suitable as so-called add-on therapy as a complement to antidepressant medication.", "pages": "1115-23"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Central fatigue in sports and daily exercises.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate changes in MEP size and central motor conduction time (CMCT) after various kinds of exercise of daily life and sports. Changes of both central and peripheral motor conduction were recorded immediately after predominantly aerobic (climbing stairs and jogging) and anaerobic (press-ups, dumb-bell holding, and 400 m-run) exercise. Strength exercise resulted in a significant decrease of MEP amplitudes. Exhausting press-ups reduced the mean MEP amplitude by 33% as compared to pre-exercise value, exhausting dumb-bell holding reduced the mean MEP amplitude by 66%. Aerobic exercises (climbing 600 steps and jogging 50 minutes) did not significantly change MEP amplitudes. The compound motor action potentials (registered after supramaximal peripheral electrical stimulation) remained unchanged after each paradigm. CMCT was not significantly altered by any of the exercises under investigation. Peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT) was slightly lengthened by 4% after isometric dumb-bell holding. PMCT and total motor conduction time were decreased after aerobic exercises, probably due to an increase of temperature of the lower extremities. In conclusion, TMS is a suitable technique for objective evaluation of central fatigue. The present study is the first to show its possible use in sports medicine, indicating that only exhaustive or strength exercises result in reduced MEPs.", "pages": "1115-23"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Linguistic processing during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9443476", "authors": ["Flitman, SS", "Grafman, J", "Wassermann, EM", "Cooper, V", "O'Grady, J", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To determine if linguistic processing could be selectively disrupted with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), rTMS was performed during a picture-word verification task. Seven right-handed subjects were trained in two conditions: picture-word verification, which required the subject to verify whether the picture of an object matched the subtitle name on the same page, and frame verification, which required subjects to verify whether there was a rectangular frame around the combined object picture and subtitle. Half of the trials were performed during rTMS. The effects of rTMS on performance were evaluated at the following four scalp positions: left anterior (the area where rTMS produced speech arrest), a mirror site on the right, and two positions in the left and right parietal region. Stimulation over the left deltoid muscle served as a control. Subjects had less difficulty in making picture-word matching decisions during unstimulated compared with stimulated trials at the left anterior and posterior positions. No significant difference in accuracy was detected in the frame verification condition, but response times in the frame verification condition were longer with stimulation at the left anterior position. Because rTMS of the dominant hemisphere affected linguistic processing independent of speech motor output, we confirm that rTMS may be used to investigate language and other cognitive functions.", "pages": "1115-23"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Effect of contraction strength on responses in biceps brachii and adductor pollicis to transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9438716", "authors": ["Taylor, JL", "Allen, GM", "Butler, JE", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In adductor pollicis, MEPs increased in size with stimulus intensity and with weak voluntary contractions (5% MVC), but did not grow larger with stronger contractions. In the elbow flexors, MEPs grew little with stimulus intensity, but increased in size with contractions of up to 50% of maximal.

In the first paradigm (n=8), paired magnetic stimuli were delivered through a double cone coil and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from quadriceps (Q) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles during relaxation. The conditioning stimulus strength was 5% of the maximum stimulator output below the threshold MEP evoked during weak voluntary contraction of TA (33+/-5%). The test stimulus (67+/-2%) was 10% of the stimulator output above the MEP threshold in the relaxed TA. Interstimulus intervals (ISIs) from 1-15 ms were examined. Conditioned TA MEPs were significantly suppressed (P<0.01) at ISIs of less than 5 ms (relative amplitude from 20-50% of the control). TA MEPs tended to be only slightly facilitated at 9-ms and 10-ms ISIs. The degree of MEP suppression was not different between right and left TA muscles despite the significant difference in size of the control responses (P<0.001). Also, conditioned MEPs were not significantly different between Q and TA. The time course of TA MEP suppression, using electrical test stimuli, was similar to that found using TMS. In the second paradigm (n=2), the suppression of TA MEPs at 2, 3, and 4 ms ISIs was examined at three conditioning intensities with the test stimulation kept constant. For the pooled 2- to 4-ms ISI data, relative amplitudes were 34+/-6%, 61+/-5%, and 98+/-9% for conditioning intensities of 0.95, 0.90, and 0.85x active threshold, respectively (P<0.01).
