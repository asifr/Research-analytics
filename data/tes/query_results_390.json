Recent anatomical MRI studies indicate that the effective stimulation sites are rather widespread. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) seems to be effective in up to 76% of drCCH patients and its benefit long-lasting. A minority of patients are able to abandon preventive drugs. Its mechanism of action appears nonspecific. In chronic migraine, randomized controlled trials of ONS showed recently encouraging results, but long-term studies are missing. An ongoing sham-controlled trial suggests sphenopalatine ganglion neurostimulation (SPGS) efficacy in drCCH acute treatment, but possibly also in preventive therapy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate cortical excitability and connectivity. TMS could prevent headache when applied over the occipital cortex during the migraine aura.

Such modulation of behaviors provides novel insights into the fundamentals and neurobiology of cognitive functions in the healthy brain, but also suggests promising prospects for translational applications into clinical populations. One type of behavior that can be modulated with noninvasive brain stimulation is decision-making. For instance, brain stimulation can induce more cautious or riskier behaviors. The capacity of influencing processes involved in decision-making is of particular interest because such processes are at the core of human social and emotional functioning (or dysfunctioning). We review cognitive neuroscience studies that have successfully modulated processes involved in decision-making with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), including risk taking, reward seeking, impulsivity, and fairness consideration. We also discuss potential clinical relevance of these findings for patients who have still unmet therapeutic need and whose alterations in decision-making represent hallmarks of their clinical symptomatology, such as individuals with addictive disorders.", "pages": "269-76"}, {"volume": "517", "title": "Anodal tDCS of dorsolateral prefontal cortex during an Implicit Association Test.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "22531748", "authors": ["Gladwin, TE", "den Uyl, TE", "Wiers, RW"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Cognitive training is an effective tool to improve a variety of cognitive functions, and a small number of studies have now shown that brain stimulation accompanying these training protocols can enhance their effects. In the domain of behavioral inhibition, little is known about how training can affect this skill. As for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), it was previously found that stimulation over the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) facilitates behavioral inhibition performance and modulates its electrophysiological correlates. This study aimed to investigate this behavioral facilitation in the context of a learning paradigm by giving tDCS over rIFG repetitively over four consecutive days of training on a behavioral inhibition task (stop signal task (SST)). Twenty-two participants took part; ten participants were assigned to receive anodal tDCS (1.5 mA, 15 min), 12 were assigned to receive training but not active stimulation. There was a significant effect of training on learning and performance in the SST, and the integration of the training and rIFG-tDCS produced a more linear learning slope. Better performance was also found in the active stimulation group. Our findings show that tDCS-combined cognitive training is an effective tool for improving the ability to inhibit responses. The current study could constitute a step toward the use of tDCS and cognitive training as a therapeutic tool for cognitive control impairments in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia.", "pages": "269-76"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Negative emotion can enhance human motor cortical plasticity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "22530869", "authors": ["Koganemaru, S", "Domen, K", "Fukuyama, H", "Mima, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "A method to improve the focalization of the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation figure-eight coil in a magnetic stimulation is presented in this paper. For the purpose of reducing the half width of the distribution curve, while improving the ratio of positive to negative electric field, a shield plate with a window and a magnetic conductor were adopted. The shield plate, which was made of highly conductive copper, focused the magnetic field into a smaller area. The magnetic inductor, which was made of highly permeable soft magnetic ferrite, strengthened the magnetic field. A group of experiments was conducted to validate the focalizing effect. Experimental results showed that the negative peak and the half width of the distribution curve reduced by using the shield plate and the magnetic conductor. Especially for to the Magstim 70 mm double coil, when the shield window was 30 \u00d7 60 mm, the ratio of positive to negative electric field could be increased 109%, while the half width of the distribution curve could be reduced about 55%.", "pages": "269-76"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Introduction: Brain Stimulation in cognitive neuroscience.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "22525369", "authors": ["Fecteau, S", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Anodal stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance performance on working memory tasks. However, it is not yet known precisely which aspects of working memory - a broad theoretical concept including short-term memory and various executive functions - are involved in such effects. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether tDCS would reduce bias effects on an Implicit Association Test, in which subjects must respond either congruently or incongruently to pre-existing evaluative associations. Such biases reflect a conflict between automatic associations and executive function, and tDCS was hypothesized to cause a shift in this balance in favor of executive function. The results clearly contradicted this hypothesis: tDCS did improve reaction times, but in the congruent rather than incongruent mapping condition. We conclude that DLPFC tDCS does not directly improve the ability to overcome bias; previous findings concerning working memory enhancement appear to reflect effects on a different component of executive function.", "pages": "269-76"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "The usefulness of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in cervical spine surgery: a retrospective analysis of 200 consecutive patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22525331", "authors": ["Li, F", "Gorji, R", "Allott, G", "Modes, K", "Lunn, R", "Yang, ZJ"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology", "abstract": "Although emotion often primes us for action, its effects on the human motor system are not well understood. The relationship between emotion and motor plasticity also remains unclear, despite the close link between emotion and memory formation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that emotion modulates the plasticity of the human primary motor cortex, using the International Affective Picture System and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation was applied to the primary motor cortex to produce long-term potentiation-like changes in normal volunteers experimentally. Primary motor cortex plasticity was enhanced and sustained in both excitatory and inhibitory systems only when intermittent theta-burst stimulation was combined with the presentation of pictures that induced negative, but not positive or neutral, emotion. Moreover, negative emotion was found to enhance the inhibitory networks within the primary motor cortex, and to improve motor behavior during the choice reaction-time task. Our findings indicate that negative emotion can increase primary motor cortex plasticity by modulating the intracortical GABAergic system, as well as N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor-dependent changes. These findings could help to explain the physiological basis of abnormal motor symptoms in psychogenic movement disorders following emotional events.", "pages": "269-76"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "The incidence of bite injuries associated with transcranial motor-evoked potential monitoring.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22523421", "authors": ["Tamkus, A", "Rice, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "The usefulness of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), including somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) and transcranial electrical motor-evoked potentials (TcMEPs) in cervical spine surgery still needs to be evaluated. We retrospectively reviewed 200 cervical spine surgery patients from 2008 to 2009 to determine the role of IONM in cervical spine surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia was used for all patients. IONM alerts were defined as a 50% decrease in amplitude, a 10% increase in latency, or a unilateral change for SSEP and an increase in stimulation threshold of more than 100 V for TcMEP. Three patients had SSEP alerts that were related to arm malposition (2 patients) and hypotension (1 patient). Five patients had TcMEP alerts: 4 alerts were caused by hypotension and 1 by bone graft compression of the spinal cord. All alerts were resolved when causative reasons were corrected. There was no postoperative iatrogenic neurological injury. The sensitivities of SSEP and TcMEP alerts for detecting impending neurological injury were 37.5% and 62.5%, respectively. The sensitivity of both SSEP and TcMEP used in combination was 100%. No false-positive and false-negative alerts were identified in either SSEP or TcMEP (100% specificity). The total intravenous anesthesia technique optimizes the detection of SSEP and TcMEP and therefore improves the sensitivity and specificity of IONM. SSEP is sensitive in detecting alerts in possible malposition-induced ischemia or brachial plexus nerve injury. TcMEP specifically detects hypotension-induced spinal functional compromises. Combination use of TcMEP and SSEP enhances the early detection of impeding neurological damage during cervical spine surgery.", "pages": "269-76"}, {"volume": "517", "title": "The tDCS effect on alpha brain oscillation for correct vs. incorrect object use.
