The aim of this study was to determine if repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) facilitates fear extinction in rats, especially when paired with exposure to a conditioned stimulus (CS). Thirty-five rats were conditioned to a tone CS by pairing the tone with an electric foot shock as an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). We assessed the effects of 10 Hz rTMS before fear extinction (experiment 1) and rTMS paired with CS during extinction (experiment 2) on the following day. Fear responses of the rats were estimated using the level of freezing upon tone stimulus and were compared between the rTMS and corresponding sham groups. The rats treated with rTMS before fear extinction showed no difference in freezing time when compared with the sham group. However, the rats treated with rTMS paired with CS during extinction showed significantly less freezing behavior than the sham group, and this enhancement of fear extinction remained after 24 h without further stimulation. This finding suggests that high-frequency rTMS paired with trauma-reminding stimuli enhances fear extinction and that rTMS in conjunction with exposure therapy is potentially useful for facilitating extinction memory in the treatment of PTSD.", "pages": "159-65"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Direct cortical stimulation but not transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials detect brain ischemia during brain tumor resection.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "21988037", "authors": ["Li, F", "Deshaies, EM", "Allott, G", "Canute, G", "Gorji, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "American journal of electroneurodiagnostic technology", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by both direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and transcranial electrical stimulation are used during brain tumor resection. Parallel use of direct cortical stimulation motor evoked potentials (DCS-MEPs) and transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials (TCeMEPs) has been practiced during brain tumor resection. We report that DCS-MEPs elicited by direct subdural grid stimulation, but not TCeMEPs, detected brain ischemia during brain tumor resection. Following resection of a brainstem high-grade glioma in a 21-year-old, the threshold of cortical motor-evoked-potentials (cMEPs) increased from 13 mA to 20 mA while amplitudes decreased. No changes were noted in transcranial motor evoked potentials (TCMEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), anesthetics, or hemodynamic parameters. Our case showed the loss of cMEPs and SSEPs, but not TCeMEPs. Permanent loss of DCS-MEPs and SSEPs was correlated with permanent left hemiplegia in our patient even when appropriate action was taken. Parallel use of DCS- and TCeMEPs with SSEPs improves sensitivity of intraoperative detection of motor impairment. DCS may be superior to TCeMEPs during brain tumor resection.", "pages": "159-65"}, {"volume": "589", "title": "Spinal inhibition of descending command to soleus motoneurons is removed prior to dorsiflexion.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 23", "pmid": "21986208", "authors": ["Geertsen, SS", "van de Ruit, M", "Grey, MJ", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "It has recently been demonstrated that soleus motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are facilitated prior to the onset of dorsiflexion. The purpose of this study was to examine if this could be explained by removal of spinal inhibition of the descending command to soleus motoneurons. To test this, we investigated how afferent inputs from the tibialis anterior muscle modulate the corticospinal activation of soleus spinal motoneurons at rest, during static contraction and prior to movement. MEPs activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes), activated by electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve (PTN), were conditioned by prior stimulation of the common peroneal nerve (CPN) at a variety of conditioning-test (CT) intervals. MEPs in the precontracted soleus muscle were inhibited when the TMS pulse was preceded by CPN stimulation with a CT interval of 35 ms, and they were facilitated for CT intervals of 50-55 ms. A similar inhibition of the soleus H-reflex was not observed. To investigate which descending pathways might be responsible for the afferent-evoked inhibition and facilitation, we examined the effect of CPN stimulation on short-latency facilitation (SLF) and long-latency facilitation (LLF) of the soleus H-reflex induced by a subthreshold TMS pulse at different CT intervals. SLF is known to reflect the excitability of the fastest conducting, corticomotoneuronal cells whereas LLF is believed to be caused by more indirect descending pathways. At CT intervals of 40-45 ms, the LLF was significantly more inhibited compared to the SLF when taking the effect on the H-reflex into account. Finally, we investigated how the CPN-induced inhibition and facilitation of the soleus MEP were modulated prior to dorsiflexion. Whereas the late facilitation (CT interval: 55 ms) was similar prior to dorsiflexion and at rest, no inhibition could be evoked at the earlier latency (CT interval: 35 ms) prior to onset of dorsiflexion. The observation that the CPN-induced inhibition of soleus MEPs disappears prior to onset of dorsiflexion may explain why soleus MEPs are facilitated prior to onset of dorsiflexion contraction. A possible mechanism involves the removal of inhibition of the descending command to the motoneurons at a spinal interneuronal level because the inhibition was seen in LLF and not in SLF, and the MEP inhibition was not observed in the H-reflex. The data illustrate that spinal interneuronal pathways modify descending commands to human spinal motoneurons and influence the size of MEPs elicited by TMS.", "pages": "159-65"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "Continuous theta-burst stimulation of the primary motor cortex in essential tremor.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "10226166", "authors": ["Hellriegel, H", "Schulz, EM", "Siebner, HR", "Deuschl, G", "Raethjen, JH"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We investigated whether essential tremor (ET) can be altered by suppressing the corticospinal excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "159-65"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "Does anodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhance excitability of the motor cortex and motor function in healthy individuals and subjects with stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16307241", "authors": ["Bastani, A", "Jaberzadeh, S"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "10 Patients with ET and 10 healthy controls underwent transcranial continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left primary motor hand area at 80% (real cTBS) and 30% (control cTBS) of active motor threshold in two separate sessions at least one week apart.

The secondary aim is to find a-tDCS optimal parameters for its maximal effects. Electronic databases were searched for studies into the effect of a-tDCS when compared to no stimulation. Studies which met the inclusion criteria were assessed and methodological quality was examined using PEDro and Downs and Black (D&B) assessment tools. Data from seven studies revealed increase in corticomotor excitability with a small but significant effect size (0.31 [0.14, 0.48], p=0.0003) in healthy subjects and data from two studies in subjects with stroke indicated significant results with moderate effect size (0.59 [0.24, 0.93], p=0.001) in favor of a-tDCS. Likewise, studies examining motor function demonstrated a small and non-significant effect (0.39 [-0.17, 0.94], p=0.17) in subjects with stroke and a large but non-significant effect (0.92 [-1.02, 2.87], p=0.35) in healthy subjects in favor of improvement in motor function. The results also indicate that efficacy of a-tDCS is dependent on current density and duration of application. A-tDCS increases corticomotor excitability in both healthy individuals and subjects with stroke. The results also show a trend in favor of motor function improvement following a-tDCS. A-tDCS is a non-invasive, cheap and easy-to-apply modality which could be used as a stand-alone technique or as an adds-on technique to enhance corticomotor excitability and the efficacy of motor training approaches.

This study tested the effects of manipulating S1 excitability with paired associative transcranial stimulation (S1-PAS) on M1 excitability. Given the important role of S1 in sensorimotor integration, we hypothesized that changes in S1 excitability would be directly paralleled by changes in M1 excitability. We applied two established protocols (S1-PAS(LTP) and S1-PAS(LTD) ) to the left S1 to induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like or long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity. S1 excitability was assessed by the early cortical components (N20-P25) of the median nerve somatosensory-evoked potential. M1 excitability was assessed by motor-evoked potential amplitude and short-interval intracortical inhibition. Effects of S1-PAS(LTP) were compared with those of a PAS(LTP) protocol targeting the left M1 (M1-PAS(LTP) ). S1-PAS(LTP) and S1-PAS(LTD) did not result in significant modifications of S1 or M1 excitability at the group level due to substantial interindividual variability. The individual S1-PAS-induced changes in S1 and M1 excitability showed no correlation. Furthermore, the individual changes in S1 and M1 excitability induced by S1-PAS(LTP) did not correlate with changes in M1 excitability induced by M1-PAS(LTP) . This demonstrates that the effects of S1-PAS in S1 are variable across individuals and, within a given individual, unrelated to those induced by S1-PAS or M1-PAS in M1. Potentially, this extends the opportunities of therapeutic PAS applications because M1-PAS 'non-responders' may well respond to S1-PAS.", "pages": "159-65"}]
