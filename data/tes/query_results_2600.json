There are convulsive SE, non-convulsive SE including complex partial status and absence status, non-convulsive electric SE and pseudostatus epilepticus, although convulsive SE is the most common. Diagnosis of status epilepticus of complex partial seizures (CPS) and absence seizures was significantly delayed because delays in seeking medical attention were common. The seizures were generalized convulsive SE in 84% and CPS status in 16%, and the overall mortality rate was 15% in 41 SE patients of our study. EEG monitoring is important to make or exclude the diagnosis of SE. Diazepam is the first choice medication and effective in the management of SE, and lately, lorazepam, midazolam, propofol and pentobarbital etc as emergency therapy. Phenytoin is also considered first-line agent in the emergency management of SE. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) led to a prolonged latency for seizure induction after an intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and effectively prevented the development of status epilepticus of PTZ-induced convulsions in the rats. Our data suggest that rTMS has suppressive effects on the neuronal excitability in rats. These effects are anticonvulsive and suggest the possibility of therapeutic use of rTMS in the patients with refractory seizures.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in movement disorders].", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "12235803", "authors": ["Ugawa, Y", "Hanajima, R"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Rinsh\u014d shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to study several aspects of movement disorders: central motor conduction time (CMCT), electromyographic (EMG) silence evoked by TMS, reset of tremor rhythm by TMS, GABAergic inhibitory interneuronal function of the motor cortex studied with paired-pulse TMS.

The inhibition was disturbed in focal dystonia, whereas normal inhibition was elicited in Segawa's disease. Reduced inhibition was seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas normal inhibition in essential tremor. Normal inhibition was evoked in all patients with chorea. Abnormal inhibition in basal ganglia disorders must reflect damaged movement selection in the motor cortex secondary to the primary lesion in the basal ganglia. This abnormality occurs in some movement disorders and does not occur in the others, which indicates different pathomechanisms for involuntary movements. It is conspicuous that normal inhibition was evoked in Segawa's disease even though the patients had dystonia.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation on motor cortex excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12654987", "authors": ["D\u00e4uper, J", "Peschel, T", "Schrader, C", "Kohlmetz, C", "Joppich, G", "Nager, W", "Dengler, R", "Rollnik, JD"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation of the brain causes considerable discomfort to the patient. The purpose of the study was to find out whether this could be affected by the choice of stimulation parameters. A spherical volume conductor model of the head and active compartmental models of a pyramidal motor nerve and scalp nociceptor were used in combination to simulate the scalp nociception to transcranial electrical stimulation. Scalp nociceptors were excited at distances of several centimetres from the electrodes. The size of the excited scalp area correlated with the length of the stimulation pulse. The area was 12.3, 20.4 and 26.0 cm2, for a 10 micros, 100 micros and 1 ms constant current pulse, respectively. With a 100 micros constant current pulse, the threshold for motor excitation was 205mA and, for nociception, it was 51 mA. There was no significant difference between constant current and capacitor discharge pulses or between electrodes of different sizes. The results imply that the use of very short stimulation pulses can reduce the pain. If a topical anaesthesia is used to reduce the pain, it has to be applied on a large area around the electrodes.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Semantic factors influence multisensory pairing: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "12221160", "authors": ["Pourtois, G", "de Gelder, B"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies suggest that whereas the left temporal neocortex plays a crucial role in all tasks involving lexical-semantic processing, some regions of the left prefrontal convexity are selectively recruited during verb processing.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increases the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic and mesostriatal system.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12629258", "authors": ["Keck, ME", "Welt, T", "M\u00fcller, MB", "Erhardt, A", "Ohl, F", "Toschi, N", "Holsboer, F", "Sillaber, I"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuropharmacology", "abstract": "To determine if there are different neural correlates for noun and verb processing in the human brain.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Chronic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) does not affect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) expression in rats in vivo.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12218707", "authors": ["Hausmann, A", "Schermer, C", "Hinterhuber, H", "Humpel, C"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Synapse (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), 20 Hz at 90% of the motor threshold, was applied to left or right prefrontal brain during object- and action-naming tasks in nine healthy subjects.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Current density threshold for the stimulation of neurons in the motor cortex area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "12213264", "authors": ["Kowalski, T", "Silny, J", "Buchner, H"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Bioelectromagnetics", "abstract": "A shortening of naming latency for actions was observed only after stimulation of left prefrontal cortex.", "pages": "1097-9"}, {"volume": "543", "title": "Mechanisms of enhancement of human motor cortex excitability induced by interventional paired associative stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "12211098", "authors": ["Stefan, K", "Kunesch, E", "Benecke, R", "Cohen, LG", "Classen, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "The involvement of the left dorsolateral frontal cortex in action naming was demonstrated using rTMS.", "pages": "1097-9"}]
