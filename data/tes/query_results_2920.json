In order to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in psychotic patients, 12 participants (four women, eight men) with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria, aged 25 to 63 years (mean (+/-s.d) 40.4+/-11.0), were enrolled in the study. Following a double-blind crossover design, patients were treated at random with 2 weeks of daily left prefrontal rTMS (20 2s 20 Hz stimulations at 80% motor threshold over 20 min, dorsolateral preforntal cortex) and 2 weeks of sham stimulation. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale decreased under active rTMS (p <0.05), whereas depressive symptoms (BDI) and anxiety (STAI) did not change significantly. Prefrontal rTMS might be effective in the non-pharmacological treatment of psychotic patients.", "pages": "4013-5"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a psychopathological animal model are suggestive of antidepressant-like effects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11182529", "authors": ["Keck, ME", "Welt, T", "Post, A", "M\u00fcller, MB", "Toschi, N", "Wigger, A", "Landgraf, R", "Holsboer, F", "Engelmann, M"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "The neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) were investigated in two rat lines selectively bred for high and low anxiety-related behavior. The stimulation parameters were adjusted according to the results of accurate computer-assisted and magnetic resonance imaging-based reconstructions of the current density distributions induced by rTMS in the rat and human brain, ensuring comparable stimulation patterns in both cases. Adult male rats were treated in two 3-day series under halothane anesthesia. In the forced swim test, rTMS-treatment induced a more active coping strategy in the high anxiety-related behavior rats only (time spent struggling; 332% vs. controls), allowing these animals to reach the performance of low anxiety-related behavior rats. In contrast, rTMS-treated low anxiety-related behavior rats did not change their swimming behavior. The development of active coping strategies in high anxiety-related behavior rats was accompanied by a significantly attenuated stress-induced elevation of plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations. In summary, the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS of frontal brain regions in high anxiety-related behavior rats are comparable to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment. Interestingly, in the psychopathological animal model repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in stress coping abilities in the high-anxiety line only.", "pages": "4013-5"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Aging affects transcranial magnetic modulation of hippocampal evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11182475", "authors": ["Levkovitz, Y", "Segal, M"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurobiology of aging", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being proposed as a method of choice for the treatment of clinical depression, yet its action in the brain is still not well understood. In previous studies we found that TMS has a long-term effect on reactivity of the hippocampus to perforant path stimulation. Since the efficacy of antidepressants is highly age-dependent, we studied possible age-related effects of TMS on hippocampal evoked responses. Young adult (3 months), aging (10 months) and aged (24-26 months) awake rats were subjected to daily TMS for one week, followed by measurements of several parameters of reactivity to perforant path stimulation in the anesthetized rat. TMS did not affect responses of the hippocampus to single perforant path stimulation, but reduced drastically paired-pulse and frequency dependent depression in the young and aging but not the old rats. Likewise, TMS increased LTP expression in the young but not the old rats, and reduced the efficacy of serotonin modulation of reactivity of the hippocampus, in the young but not the old rats. Thus, long term effects of chronic TMS on local GABAergic inhibition are highly age dependent.", "pages": "4013-5"}, {"volume": "299", "title": "Modulation of a motor evoked response to transcranial magnetic stimulation by the activity level of the first dorsal interosseous muscle in humans when grasping a stationary object with different grip widths.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "11166923", "authors": ["Hasegaw, Y", "Kasai, T", "Kinoshita, H", "Yahagi, S"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "A relation between corticospinal excitability and background voluntary muscular activity was investigated at low and high transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intensities while grasping a stationary object with different widths (2 and 8 cm) using a precision grip. The muscle activity was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Regression analysis revealed that there was a linear relation between the motor evoked potential (MEP) and background muscular activity for both grip widths at each of the TMS intensities. At the low TMS intensity, the slope of the regression lines was similar for the 2 and 8 cm grip widths. It was, however, different when the TMS intensity was high. The results suggested that sensitivity modulation of bias level (input) facilitation occurred with wider grip width.

Transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation (TMCS) was employed to map the topography of the primary corticomotor projection to the hand and to obtain measures of cortical motor threshold, long-latency intracortical inhibition and corticospinal conduction. Changes in motor threshold and in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and latency in keeping with persisting impairment of conduction in the corticospinal pathway were still present in the majority of subjects, whereas the duration of the post-MEP silent period, reflecting the strength of long-latency intracortical inhibition, was usually normal. Topographic shifts in the corticomotor representation relative to the unaffected side were found in the majority of subjects. In some the shifts were in the mediolateral axis suggesting reorganisation within the primary motor cortex, while in the others anteroposterior shifts were present in keeping with recruitment of premotor or postcentral cortex. The present findings indicate that changes in the physiological properties of the corticomotor projection to the hand are frequently present in subjects who have recovered motor function after a subcortical stroke and may persist indefinitely. We postulate that these changes are the result of reorganisation at cortical level and that cortical reorganisation is one of the processes which contribute to motor recovery after a subcortical lesion and which may compensate for persisting impairment of conduction in the corticospinal pathway.", "pages": "4013-5"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "Motor and phosphene thresholds: a transcranial magnetic stimulation correlation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11164880", "authors": ["Stewart, LM", "Walsh, V", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "To investigate the stability of visual phosphene thresholds and to assess whether they correlate with motor thresholds.", "pages": "4013-5"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Analysis of stimuli triggering attacks of paroxysmal dystonia induced by exertion.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11160479", "authors": ["Meyer, BU", "Irlbacher, K", "Meierkord, H"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Currently, motor threshold is used as an index of cortical sensitivity so that in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments, intensity can be set at a given percentage of this value.
