Single- and paired-pulse TMS studies have been done mainly for pathophysiologic purposes. Repetitive TMS has been used largely for therapy. Many TMS abnormalities are seen in the different diseases. They concur to show that motor cortical areas and their projections are the main target of the basal ganglia dysfunction typical of movement disorders. Interpretation has not always been clear, and sometimes there were discrepancies and contradictions. Largely, this may be the result of the extreme heterogeneity of the methods used and of the patients studied. It is premature to give repetitive TMS a role in treatment. Overall, however, TMS gives rise to a new, outstanding enthusiasm in the neurophysiology of movement disorders. There is reason to predict that TMS, with its continuous technical refinement, will prove even more helpful in the near future. Then, research achievements are reasonably expected to spill over into clinical practice.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Pharmacologic influences on TMS effects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "12436084", "authors": ["Boroojerdi, B"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used increasingly to probe the physiology of the human cortex. Besides measuring directly the cortical excitability in motor and visual systems, this noninvasive method can be used to study short- and long-term cortical plasticity.

While it is clear that paired-pulse excitability depends on the exact interstimulus interval (ISI) between the first (S1) and second stimulus (S2), relatively little is known about the effects of the intensities of S1 and S2, and the effects of manipulating neurotransmission through the GABA(A) receptor. When recording the motor evoked potential (MEP) from the resting abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle, using a fixed ISI of 1.5 ms, and expressing the interaction between S1 and S2 as MEP(S1+S2)/(MEP(S1) + MEP(S2)), then a systematic variation of the intensities of S1 and S2 revealed short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) if S1 and S2 were approximately equal to MEP threshold (RMT), or if S1 > RMT and S2 < RMT. In contrast, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) occurred if S1 < RMT and S2 > RMT. Contraction of the ADM left SICI unchanged but reduced SICF. The GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam increased SICI and reduced SICF in the resting ADM while diazepam had no effect during ADM contraction. Surface EMG and single motor unit recordings revealed that during ADM contraction SICI onset was at the I3-wave latency of S2, whereas SICF typically \"jumped up\" by one I-wave and started with the I2-wave latency of S2. Findings suggest that SICI is mediated through a low-threshold GABA(A) receptor-dependent inhibitory pathway and summation of IPSP from S1 and EPSP from S2 at the corticospinal neurone. In contrast, SICF originates through non-synaptic facilitation at the initial axon segment of interneurones along a high-threshold excitatory pathway.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Mapping of the human visual cortex using image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8930851", "authors": ["Fernandez, E", "Alfaro, A", "Tormos, JM", "Climent, R", "Mart\u00ednez, M", "Vilanova, H", "Walsh, V", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Brain research.

TMS is applied with a figure of eight coil to 28 positions arranged in a 2x2-cm grid over the occipital area. A digitizing tablet connected to a PC computer running customized software, and audio and video recording are used for detailed and accurate data collection and analysis of evoked phosphenes. A frameless image-guided neuronavigational device is used to describe the position of the actual sites of the stimulation coils relative to the cortical surface. Our results show that TMS is able to elicit phosphenes in almost all sighted subjects and in a proportion of blind subjects. Evoked phosphenes are topographically organized. Despite minor inter-individual variations, the mapping results are reproducible and show good congruence among different subjects. This procedure has potential to improve our understanding of physiologic organization and plastic changes in the human visual system and to establish the degree of remaining functional visual cortex in blind subjects. Such a non-invasive method is critical for selection of suitable subjects for a cortical visual prosthesis.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "125", "title": "Abnormal somatotopic arrangement of sensorimotor interactions in dystonic patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 12", "pmid": "7932215", "authors": ["Tamburin, S", "Manganotti, P", "Marzi, CA", "Fiaschi, A", "Zanette, G"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "The aim of the study was to detect abnormalities of sensorimotor interactions and their topographic distribution in the hand muscles of dystonic patients. We investigated the effect of electrical stimulation of the second (D2) and fifth (D5) fingers on the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in the relaxed first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles on both sides of eight patients with unilateral hand dystonia (HD) and in four patients with cervical dystonia (CD). Six Parkinson's disease patients were used as the disease control group and 10 healthy subjects served as normal controls. For each muscle, the digital stimulation was applied to a contiguous finger (CF) and to a non-contiguous finger (NCF). The digital stimulation was set at three times the sensory threshold and preceded TMS or TES at intervals ranging from 10 to 100 ms. In normal subjects, a somatotopic inhibitory effect was detected, since the CF stimulation was significantly more powerful in determining the reduction of MEPs in response to TMS at intervals ranging from 20 to 50 ms. In dystonic patients, on the contrary, the somatopic effect was not present, because both CF and NCF stimulation evoked a consistent MEP inhibition and no significant difference was detected between the conditioning effect of CF and NCF stimulation. These abnormalities were present in the muscles of both the affected and unaffected hands of HD patients, as well as in CD patients. TES conditioning provoked MEP inhibition only at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) <40 ms. Significant MEP potentiation was found at ISIs of 20-40 ms to CF stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, while there was no effect after NCF stimulation. These data suggest that MEP suppression in response to digital stimulation is preserved in dystonia, but the somatotopically distributed input-output organization of the sensorimotor interactions is lost in dystonic patients' hands. The comparison between TMS and TES experiments indicates that abnormalities may be present at both the spinal and the cortical level, at least in some patients. These findings suggest that a mechanism that normally operates in order to focus the effect of somatosensory afferences on the motor system may be impaired in dystonia. This abnormality seems specific to dystonia.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "177", "title": "Both dorsal and ventral spinal cord pathways contribute to overground locomotion in the adult rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9028772", "authors": ["Loy, DN", "Talbott, JF", "Onifer, SM", "Mills, MD", "Burke, DA", "Dennison, JB", "Fajardo, LC", "Magnuson, DS", "Whittemore, SR"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Identification of long tracts responsible for spontaneous locomotion is critical for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair strategies. We recently demonstrated that extensive demyelination of adult rat thoracic ventral columns, ventromedial, and ventrolateral white matter produces persistent, significant open-field hindlimb locomotor deficits. Locomotor movements resulting from stimulation of the pontomedullary locomotor region are inhibited by dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) lesions suggesting that important pathways for locomotion may also exist in the dorsal white matter. However, dorsal hemisections that interrupt dorsal columns/dorsal corticospinal tract (DC/CST) and DLF pathways do not produce persistent, severe locomotor deficits in the adult rat. We studied the contributions of myelinated tracts in the DLF and DC/CST to overground locomotion following complete conduction blockade of axons in the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF), a region important for locomotor movements and for transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (tcMMEP). Animals received ethidium bromide plus photon irradiation to produce discrete demyelinating lesions sufficient to stop axonal conduction in the VLF, combined VLF + DLF, or combined VLF + DC/CST. Open-field BBB scores and tcMMEPs were studied at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks postlesion. VLF lesions resulted in mean BBB scores of 17 at 4 weeks. VLF + DC/CST and VLF + DLF lesions resulted in mean BBB scores of 15.9 and 11.1, respectively. TcMMEPs were absent in all lesion types confirming VLF conduction blockade throughout the study. Our data indicate that significant contributions to locomotion from myelinated pathways within the rat DLF can be revealed when combined with simultaneous compromise of the VLF.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "221", "title": "Correlation between severity of clinical signs and motor evoked potentials after transcranial magnetic stimulation in large-breed dogs with cervical spinal cord disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9051592", "authors": ["Poma, R", "Parent, JM", "Holmberg, DL", "Partlow, GD", "Monteith, G", "Sylvestre, AM"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association", "abstract": "To evaluate use of transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials for assessment of the functional integrity of the cervical spinal cord in large-breed dogs with cervical spinal cord disease.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human frontal eye field: effects on visual perception and attention.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "9295398", "authors": ["Grosbras, MH", "Paus, T"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Randomized, controlled, masked study.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Direct demonstration of long latency cortico-cortical inhibition in normal subjects and in a patient with vascular parkinsonism.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "9504843", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Oliviero, A", "Mazzone, P", "Pilato, F", "Saturno, E", "Insola, A", "Visocchi, M", "Colosimo, C", "Tonali, PA", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "10 healthy large-breed control dogs and 25 large-breed dogs with cervical spinal cord diseases.", "pages": "272-93"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Linking physics with physiology in TMS: a sphere field model to determine the cortical stimulation site in TMS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9508823", "authors": ["Thielscher, A", "Kammer, T"], "year": "2002", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Affected dogs were allocated to 3 groups on the basis of neurologic status: signs of neck pain alone, ambulatory with ataxia in all limbs, or nonambulatory.
