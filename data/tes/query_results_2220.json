[{"volume": "8", "title": "Bimanual coordination: an unbalanced field of research.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15118197", "authors": ["Obhi, SS"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Motor control", "abstract": "Using more than one limb to perform functional, goal-directed actions is arguably one of the most important abilities that human beings possess. In many everyday tasks, the hands, in particular, must be used to accomplish all manner of goals. From buttoning a shirt to opening a jam jar and driving to work, good bimanual coordination is of great utility. In addition to the tasks mentioned above, there are also other tasks involving the functional use of more than one limb, including walking or cycling and typing a report. With a little thought, it becomes apparent that there is at least one important difference between these categories of coordination tasks. On one hand, in some tasks the effectors must perform markedly different motor outputs that are bound together in some functionally defined and usually object-oriented manner (e.g., buttoning a shirt) yet, in others, the effectors produce very similar motor outputs but in a specific temporal order, which may or may not repeat itself periodically (e.g., walking and cycling compared to typing or drumming). In this short article, I will argue that the second category of coordination task and, in particular, cyclical coordination, has been studied extensively and, at least at the level of behavior, is relatively well understood. In contrast the former category of bimanual task is seldom studied and, even at the descriptive level, is rather poorly understood. One of the reasons for this may be the complexity of such tasks and the technical difficulties involved in attempting to study them. By highlighting some key studies, I hope to illustrate that such tasks can be fruitfully studied in the laboratory. Last, since the neural control processes underlying both classes of coordination task are not yet well known, I aim to draw attention to the potential value of the interventional technique of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a tool for investigating the functions of brain regions contributing to bimanual coordination.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Different short-term modulation of cortical motor output to distal and proximal upper-limb muscles during painful sensory nerve stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "15116369", "authors": ["Urban, PP", "Solinski, M", "Best, C", "Rolke, R", "Hopf, HC", "Dieterich, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "The pattern of upper-limb muscle activation following painful stimulation has not been clarified in detail. We investigated the short-term inhibitory and excitatory effects of painful electrical digital stimulation on the motoneuron pools of distal and proximal upper-limb muscles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used as test stimulus, and painful digital nerve stimulation as conditioning stimulus for motor evoked potential (MEP) recordings over the abductor digiti minimi (ADM), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), biceps brachii (BB), and deltoid muscles. Inhibition of the conditioned MEP response was most prominent in the distal muscles, whereas BB and deltoid muscles were only weakly inhibited. The mean MEP response over APB decreased with painful cutaneous stimuli, showing maximum inhibition (by 82%) at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 50 ms. Inhibition in the ADM was maximal (49%) but less pronounced at an ISI of 40 ms. The BB and deltoid muscles showed inhibition by 25% and 29%, respectively. Significant facilitation was present in BB and deltoid muscles by 43% and 41% at an ISI of 100 ms, but not in the smaller hand muscles. The observed pattern of upper-limb muscle activation corresponds to the protective withdrawal reflex and the neuronal basis of the observed short-term modulation of motor activity is compatible with a spinal or brainstem pathway.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Cutaneous inputs can activate the ipsilateral primary motor cortex during bimanual sensory-driven movements in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "15115786", "authors": ["Shibuya, S", "Ohki, Y"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we examined whether sensory input from a finger affects activity of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) when human subjects hold a virtual object bimanually and whether this ipsilateral activation varies under different contexts. Subjects used both index fingers to hold two plates, which were subjected to unpredictable pulling loads from torque motors. Loads were delivered in a random sequence to either plate or concurrently to both, although the latter occurred most frequently. Finger forces vertical to the plates and surface electromyographs from the first dorsal interosseous muscles were recorded bilaterally during the task. TMS was sometimes applied over the finger area of the left M1 at variable times relative to load onset to examine cortical excitability. Strength of TMS was set around the active motor threshold of the right finger muscle while subjects waited for loading to the handheld plates. When one plate was singly loaded, the M1 contralateral to the loaded finger was activated, causing automatic force increases in the finger. In addition, the ipsilateral M1 was activated during such loading, associated with transient force increases in the contralateral nonloaded finger. Activations in the ipsilateral M1 were also observed during concurrent loading, when activations were stronger than those following single loading of the contralateral plate. Ipsilateral activations weakened when concurrent loading was less frequent. These results suggest interactions between bilateral sensorimotor cortices during bimanual coordinated movements, with strength varying by context.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Current status of the utilization of antiepileptic treatments in mood, anxiety and aggression: drugs and devices.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15112459", "authors": ["Barry, JJ", "Lembke, A", "Bullock, KD"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "Interventions that have been utilized to control seizures in people with epilepsy have been employed by the psychiatric community to treat a variety of disorders. The purpose of this review will be to give an overview of the most prominent uses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and devices like the Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in the treatment of psychiatric disease states. By far, the most prevalent use of these interventions is in the treatment of mood disorders. AEDs have become a mainstay in the effective treatment of Bipolar Affective Disorder (BAD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of valproic acid for acute mania, and lamotrigine for BAD maintenance therapy. AEDs are also effectively employed in the treatment of anxiety and aggressive disorders. Finally, VNS and TMS are emerging as possibly useful tools in the treatment of more refractory depressive illness.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Magnetic brain stimulation can improve clinical outcome in incomplete spinal cord injured patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "15111994", "authors": ["Belci, M", "Catley, M", "Husain, M", "Frankel, HL", "Davey, NJ"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Spinal cord", "abstract": "Preliminary longitudinal clinical trial.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "Stiff-person syndromes: motor cortex hyperexcitability correlates with anti-GAD autoimmunity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "15111674", "authors": ["Koerner, C", "Wieland, B", "Richter, W", "Meinck, HM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To test the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in modulating corticospinal inhibition and improving recovery in stable incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI).", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "The effects of transcranial electrostimulation on the adaptive state.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15109089", "authors": ["Markina, LD", "Kratinova, EA"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience and behavioral physiology", "abstract": "National Spinal Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Bucks, UK and Division of Neuroscience, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Charing Cross Hospital, London, UK.", "pages": "111-20"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Distal-type cervical spondylotic amyotrophy: assessment of pathophysiology from radiological findings on magnetic resonance imaging and epidurally recorded spinal cord responses.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "15105684", "authors": ["Kaneko, K", "Taguchi, T", "Toyoda, K", "Kato, Y", "Azuma, Y", "Kawai, S"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Four stable iSCI patients were treated with rTMS over the occipital cortex (sham treatment) and then over the motor cortex (real treatment).
