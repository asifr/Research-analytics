The purpose of this work was to find the location of the direct activation. The response to stimulation was modeled with a spherical head model and an active model of a corticospinal nerve. The nerve model had a deep bend at a location corresponding to a corticospinal fiber entering the midbrain. The threshold activation initiated close to brain surface; the exact location depended on whether the cell body located in the surface layers of the brain or in the bank of the central sulcus. The stimulation time constant was 44 micros. When the stimulus amplitude was increased, the site of activation shifted gradually to deeper level, until the activation initiated directly at the bend causing a half millisecond latency jump at spinal level. These results support the theory that the corticospinal axons can be directly activated at deep locations using anodal transcranial electrical stimulation. However, the high amplitude needed for the direct activation suggests that not only the bends on the fibers, but also the shape of surrounding volume conductor (intracranial cavity) favor activation at this location.", "pages": "238-44"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Cortical silent period evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in ischemic stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9741788", "authors": ["Ahonen, JP", "Jehkonen, M", "Dastidar, P", "Moln\u00e1r, G", "H\u00e4kkinen, V"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex produces motor evoked potentials (MEPs).

The effect of stimulus frequency was variable, with each subject having a distinctive \"frequency tuning curve,\" but overall, the threshold current necessary to produce phosphenes decreased as frequency of stimulation increased.

TMS may result in either inhibition or facilitation of language processes and may operate directly at a presumptive site of language cortex or indirectly through intracortical networks. TMS has been used to create reversible \"temporary lesions,\" similar to those produced by Wada tests and direct cortical electrical stimulation, in cerebral cortical areas subserving language function. Rapid-rate TMS over the left inferior frontal region blocks speech output in most subjects. However, the results are not those predicted from classic models of language organization. Speech arrest is obtained most easily over facial motor cortex, and true aphasia is rare, whereas right hemisphere or bilateral lateralization is unexpectedly prominent. A clinical role for these techniques is not yet fully established. Interfering with language comprehension and verbal memory is currently more difficult than blocking speech output, but numerous TMS studies have demonstrated facilitation of language-related tasks, including oral word association, story recall, digit span, and picture naming. Conversely, speech output also facilitates motor responses to TMS in the dominant hemisphere. Such new and often-unexpected findings may provide important insights into the organization of language.", "pages": "238-44"}, {"volume": "80", "title": "Visualization of the information flow through human oculomotor cortical regions by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2231424", "authors": ["Terao, Y", "Fukuda, H", "Ugawa, Y", "Hikosaka, O", "Hanajima, R", "Furubayashi, T", "Sakai, K", "Miyauchi, S", "Sasaki, Y", "Kanazawa, I"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "1. In human subjects, stretch applied to ankle dorsiflexors elicited three bursts of reflex activity in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (labelled M1, M2 and M3) at mean onset latencies of 44, 69 and 95 ms, respectively. The possibility that the later of these reflex bursts is mediated by a transcortical pathway was investigated. 2. The stretch evoked a cerebral potential recorded from the somatosensory cortex at a mean onset latency of 47 ms in nine subjects. In the same subjects a compound motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the TA muscle, evoked by magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, had a mean onset latency of 32 ms. The M1 and the M2 reflexes thus had too short a latency to be caused by a transcortical pathway (minimum latency, 79 ms (47 + 32)), whereas the later part of the M2 and all of the M3 reflex had a sufficiently long latency. 3. When the transcranial magnetic stimulation was timed so that the MEP arrived in the TA muscle at the same time as the M1 or M2 reflexes, no extra increase in the potential was observed. However, when the MEP arrived at the same time as the M3 reflex a significant (P < 0.01) extra-facilitation was observed in all twelve subjects investigated. 4. Peaks evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the post-stimulus time histogram of the discharge probability of single TA motor units (n = 28) were strongly facilitated when they occurred at the same time as the M3 response. This was not the case for the first peaks evoked by electrical transcranial stimulation in any of nine units investigated. 5. We suggest that these findings are explained by an increased cortical excitability following TA stretch and that this supports the hypothesis that the M3 response in the TA muscle is - at least partly - mediated by a transcortical reflex.", "pages": "238-44"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Effects of coil orientation and magnetic field shield on transcranial magnetic stimulation in cats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "957257", "authors": ["Nakatoh, S", "Kitagawa, H", "Kawaguchi, Y", "Nakamura, H", "Takano, H", "Tsuji, H"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "1. To find out whether muscle afferents influence the excitability of corticospinal projections to antagonist muscles, we studied sixteen healthy subjects and one patient with a focal brain lesion. 2. Using transcranial magnetic and electrical brain stimulation we tested the excitability of corticomotoneuronal connections to right forearm muscles at rest after conditioning stimulation of the median nerve at the elbow. Somatosensory potentials evoked by median nerve stimulation were also recorded in each subject. 3. Test stimuli delivered at 13-19 ms after median nerve stimulation significantly inhibited EMG responses elicited in forearm extensor muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation, but did not inhibit responses to electrical stimulation. In contrast, magnetically and electrically elicited responses in forearm flexor muscles were suppressed to the same extent. 4. The higher the intensity of the test shocks, the smaller was the amount of median nerve-elicited inhibition. Inhibition in extensor muscles was also smaller during tonic wrist extension, or if the induced electrical stimulating current in the brain flowed from posterior to anterior over the motor strip rather than vice versa. Test responses evoked by magnetic transcranial stimulation in the first dorsal interosseous and in brachioradialis muscles were not inhibited after median nerve stimulation at the elbow. Stimulation of digital nerves failed to inhibit motor potentials in extensor muscles. 5. Test stimuli delivered at 15 and 17 ms after radial nerve stimulation significantly inhibited EMG responses elicited in forearm flexor muscles by magnetic transcranial stimulation. 6. In the patient with a focal thalamic lesion, who had dystonic postures and an absent N20 component of the somatosensory-evoked potentials but normal strength, median nerve stimulation failed to inhibit magnetically evoked responses in forearm extensor muscles. 7. We propose that activation of median nerve muscle afferents can suppress the excitability of cortical areas controlling the antagonist forearm extensor muscles acting on the hand. The inhibitory effect occurs at short latency and might assist spinal pathways mediating reciprocal inhibition by contrasting the co-activation of antagonistic pools of corticospinal cells.", "pages": "238-44"}]
