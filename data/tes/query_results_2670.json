The purpose of this study was to obtain physiological evidence in behaving human subjects on the mode of operation of the primary motor cortex during coordinated movements of the forelimb. We approached this problem by studying a pointing movement involving the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and index finger as follows. Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure the input-output (I/O) curves-a measure of the corticospinal pathway excitability-of proximal (anterior deltoid, AD, and triceps brachii, TB) and distal muscles (extensor carpi radialis, ECR, and first dorsal interosseus, 1DI) during isolated contraction of one of these muscles or during selective co-activation with other muscles involved in pointing. Compared to an isolated contraction of the ECR, the plateau-level of the ECR sigmoid I/O curve increased markedly during co-activation with the AD while pointing. In contrast, the I/O curve of AD was not influenced by activation of the more distal muscles involved in pointing. Moreover, the 1DI I/O curve was not influenced by activation of the more proximal muscles. Three arguments argue for a cortical site of facilitation of ECR motor potentials. First, ECR motor potentials evoked by a near threshold TMS stimulus were facilitated when the AD and ECR were co-activated during pointing but not those in response to a near threshold anodal electrical stimulus. Second, the ECR H reflex was not found to be task dependent, indicating that the recruitment gain of the ECR alpha-motoneuron pool did not differ between tasks. Finally, in comparison with an isolated ECR contraction, intracortical inhibition tested at the ECR cortical site was decreased during pointing. These results suggest that activation of shoulder, elbow, and wrist muscles involved in pointing appear to involve, at least in part, common motor cortical circuits. In contrast, at least in the pointing task, the motor cortical circuits involved in activation of the 1DI appear to act independently.", "pages": "3006-17"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Here, we show that INB also elicits functional changes in homotopic regions of the cortex contralateral to the deafferented one. We measured motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in small hand and biceps brachii muscles before, during and after INB of the right hand. INB increased excitability of the cortical representation of (i) the intact hand and (ii) body parts proximal to the deafferented hand (upper arm), in the absence of excitability changes in other body part representations such as thorax or leg muscles. This effect persisted throughout the entire period of deafferentation and returned to baseline values afterward. Motor responses to brainstem electrical stimulation remained unchanged during INB, indicating that the effect is probably of cortical origin. Lorazepam, a GABA(A) receptor agonist, blocked this increased excitability. Interhemispheric inhibition between hand muscles decreased during INB. After chronic deafferentation in amputees, MEP amplitudes and motor output curves in small hand muscles were depressed and motor thresholds were elevated compared with aged-matched controls. These results indicate that acute hand deafferentation can elicit a focal increase in excitability in the hand motor representation contralateral to the deafferented cortex that is influenced by transcallosal interactions and GABAergic transmission, and is balanced in the setting of chronic deafferentation.", "pages": "3006-17"}, {"volume": "125", "title": "Cortical excitability changes induced by deafferentation of the contralateral hemisphere.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 6", "pmid": "12023328", "authors": ["Werhahn, KJ", "Mortensen, J", "Kaelin-Lang, A", "Boroojerdi, B", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Interhemispheric inhibition between motor cortices is reduced in musicians. In the present study we have assessed intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) within ipsilateral motor cortex in 15 musicians and 15 non-musician controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) from left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle at rest, and during voluntary index finger abduction (0.5 N). Paired TMS with subthreshold conditioning was used to test early ICI with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) 1-5 ms, and ICF with ISIs 8-15 ms. Suprathreshold conditioning was used to test late ICI with ISIs 100-200 ms. TMS thresholds were similar in musicians and controls both at rest and with weak voluntary activation of FDI, indicating that postsynaptic excitability of corticospinal neurons was similar in both groups. ICI was less effective in musicians with FDI at rest and active, but only with an ISI of 3 ms. ICF was less effective in musicians under both rest and active conditions, and this was independent of ISI. There were no differences in late ICI between musicians and controls. We conclude that ICI and ICF circuits which are activated by weak TMS have less influence on corticospinal neuron excitability in musicians. Because of the dependence on ISI, the most likely explanation for the reduced ICI in musicians is an alteration of the interaction between the ICI circuit and neural elements responsible for the later I-waves evoked in corticospinal neurons by TMS. Excitability of the neural elements producing early and late ICI is not altered in musicians. Reduced ICF in musicians could be due to reduced excitability of neurons responsible for ICF, or an altered balance of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons which favours neurons that are not acted upon by the ICF circuit. The reduced influence of ICI and ICF circuits on corticospinal neuron excitability in musicians is likely to reflect a training-induced adaptation. It is not clear at present whether these differences represent an adaptive change related to their extraordinary control of finger movements, or alternatively a maladaptive change induced by \"overuse\" of the hands from extensive training.", "pages": "3006-17"}, {"volume": "144", "title": "Reduced intracortical inhibition and facilitation of corticospinal neurons in musicians.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "12021815", "authors": ["Nordstrom, MA", "Butler, SL"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Because opiates suppress some, but not all, nociceptive reflexes, we studied the effect of the narcotic-analgesic drug fentanyl on the CSP and the R III reflex. The CSP was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in seven normal subjects during voluntary contraction, before and 10 and 20 min after fentanyl injection. To assess possible fentanyl-induced changes, we also tested the effect of finger stimulation on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited in the FDI muscle by transcranial magnetic stimulation before and after fentanyl injection. Fentanyl-induced changes were also studied on the R III reflex recorded from the biceps femoris muscle. Fentanyl, as expected, suppressed the R III reflex but failed to change the inhibitory effect of finger stimulation on FDI motoneurons. Finger stimulation reduced the size of MEPs in the FDI, and fentanyl injection left this inhibitory effect unchanged. The differential fentanyl-induced modulation of the CSP and R III reflex provides evidence that the CSP circuit is devoid of mu-opiate receptors and is therefore an opiate-insensitive nociceptive reflex, which may be useful in the assessment of central-acting, non-opioid drugs.", "pages": "3006-17"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Is the cutaneous silent period an opiate-sensitive nociceptive reflex?", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11994963", "authors": ["Inghilleri, M", "Conte, A", "Frasca, V", "Berardelli, A", "Manfredi, M", "Cruccu, G"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "", "pages": "3006-17"}]
