Distinct eccentricities were investigated separately, since at the cortical level, more central regions of the visual field are represented closer to the occipital pole, i.e. closer to the polarizing electrodes, than are the more peripheral regions. Using a double-blind and sham-controlled within-subject design, we measured the effect of stimulation and potential learning effect separately across testing days. Anodal stimulation of the visual cortex compared to sham stimulation yielded a significant increase in contrast sensitivity within 8\u00b0 of the visual field. A significant increase in contrast sensitivity between the conditions \"pre\" and \"post\" anodal stimulation was only obtained for the central positions at eccentricities smaller than 2\u00b0. Cathodal stimulation of the visual cortex did not affect contrast sensitivity at either eccentricity. Perceptual learning across testing days was only observed for threshold perimetry before stimulation. Measuring contrast sensitivity changes after tDCS with a standard clinical tool such as threshold perimetry may provide an interesting perspective in assessing therapeutic effects of tDCS in ophthalmological or neurological defects (e.g. with foveal sparing vs. foveal splitting).", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Electrode montages for tDCS and weak transcranial electrical stimulation: role of \"return\" electrode's position and size.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "21035740", "authors": ["Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Rahman, A", "Scaturro, J"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To determine which mechanisms lead to activation of neurons in the motor cortex during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with different current directions and pulse waveforms.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Excitability testing: from nerve to muscle.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "18525028", "authors": ["Kuwabara, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The total electric field induced in a simplified model of a cortical sulcus by a figure-eight coil was calculated using the finite element method (FEM).
