We previously found that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the ATLs improved retrieval of proper names in young adults (Ross et al., 2010). Here we extend that finding to older adults who tend to experience greater proper-naming deficits than young adults. The task was to look at pictures of famous faces or landmarks and verbally recall the associated proper name. Our results show a numerical improvement in face naming after left or right ATL stimulation, but a statistically significant effect only after left-lateralized stimulation. The magnitude of the enhancing effect was similar in older and younger adults but the lateralization of the effect differed depending on age. The implications of these findings for the use of tDCS as tool for rehabilitation of age-related loss of name recall are discussed.", "pages": "182-6"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Brain stimulation and behavioural cognitive rehabilitation: a new tool for neurorehabilitation?", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12849236", "authors": ["Miniussi, C", "Vallar, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation", "abstract": "Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) is a safe and noninvasive tool for measuring cortical inhibition in humans, particularly in patients with disorders of cortical inhibition such as epilepsy. However, ppTMS protocols in rodent disease models, where mechanistic insight into the ppTMS physiology and into disease processes may be obtained, have been limited due to the requirement for anesthesia and needle electromyography. To eliminate the confounding factor of anesthesia and to approximate human ppTMS protocols in awake rats, we adapted the mechanomyogram (MMG) method to investigate the ppTMS inhibitory phenomenon in awake rats and then applied differential pharmacology to test the hypothesis that long-interval cortical inhibition is mediated by the GABA(A) receptor. Bilateral hindlimb-evoked MMGs were elicited in awake rats by long-interval ppTMS protocols with 50-, 100-, and 200-ms interstimulus intervals. Acute changes in ppTMS-MMG were measured before and after intraperitoneal injections of saline, the GABA(A) agonist pentobarbital (PB), and GABA(A) antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). An evoked MMG was obtained in 100% of animals by single-pulse stimulation, and ppTMS resulted in predictable inhibition of the test-evoked MMG. With increasing TMS intensity, MMG amplitudes increased in proportion to machine output to produce reliable input-output curves. Simultaneous recordings of electromyography and MMG showed a predictable latency discrepancy between the motor-evoked potential and the evoked MMG (7.55 \u00b1 0.08 and 9.16 \u00b1 0.14 ms, respectively). With pharmacological testing, time course observations showed that ppTMS-MMG inhibition was acutely reduced following PTZ (P < 0.05), acutely enhanced after PB (P < 0.01) injection, and then recovered to pretreatment baseline after 1 h. Our data support the application of the ppTMS-MMG technique for measuring the cortical excitability in awake rats and provide the evidence that GABA(A) receptor contributes to long-interval paired-pulse cortical inhibition. Thus ppTMS-MMG appears a well-tolerated biomarker for measuring GABA(A)-mediated cortical inhibition in rats.", "pages": "182-6"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "Modulating oscillatory brain activity correlates of behavioral inhibition using transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "14579004", "authors": ["Jacobson, L", "Ezra, A", "Berger, U", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This article is a selective review of functional imaging investigations and brain stimulation studies addressing the neural mechanisms of recovery of stroke-associated aphasia. The imaging results show that aphasia recovery is associated with a complex pattern of brain reorganisation, involving both ipsilateral and contralateral brain regions, which is modulated by lesion size and site, time post-onset, type of training, and language task. The information provided by the imaging investigations needs to be integrated with the results of brain stimulation studies, in order to specify the most effective protocols in term of modality, locus and timing of stimulation. Further studies, using multiple imaging and neuromodulation approaches, are required to reach sound conclusions about the potential usefulness of brain stimulation approaches as an adjunct to aphasia rehabilitation.", "pages": "182-6"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "What has transcranial magnetic stimulation taught us about neural adaptations to strength training?

The first part of this article reviews brain stimulation studies related to language recovery in aphasic patients. The second part reports results from a pilot study with three chronic stroke patients who had non-fluent aphasia, where real or placebo rTMS was immediately followed by 25 minutes of individualised speech therapy. Real rTMS consisted of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9) for 25 minutes. Each patient underwent a total of four weeks of intervention. P1 underwent four weeks of real rTMS (5\u2009days/week) where individualised speech therapy was provided for 25 minutes immediately following each rTMS session. P2 and P3 each underwent two weeks of placebo rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy; then two weeks of real rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy. Assessments took place at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks post-entry/baseline testing. Relative to entry/baseline testing, a significant improvement in object naming was observed at all testing times, from two weeks post-intervention in real rTMS plus speech therapy, or placebo rTMS plus speech therapy. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of targeted behavioural training in combination with brain stimulation in chronic aphasic patients.
