Tonic contraction of the target muscle modifies the aftereffects of TBS, whereas interactions between phasic muscle contraction and the aftereffects of TBS are unknown. In this paper, we investigated whether phasic voluntary movements influence TBS-induced changes in M1 excitability. We examined whether a brief sequence of phasic finger movements performed by healthy humans before both intermittent TBS (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) influences TBS-induced aftereffects. Ten healthy subjects underwent iTBS and cTBS. To evaluate the TBS-induced aftereffects on M1 excitability, single TMS pulses were given over the FDI motor area before (T0) and 5 (T1), 15 (T2), and 30 min (T3) after TBS. To find out whether finger movements influenced the TBS-induced aftereffects, we tested motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) size by single TMS pulses at T0, immediately after movements, and at T1-T3. We also measured the kinematic variables mean amplitude and mean peak velocity of the movements. When no phasic voluntary movements preceded TBS, iTBS elicited facilitatory and cTBS elicited inhibitory aftereffects on MEP size. Conversely, movements performed before TBS elicited significant changes in the direction of the TBS-induced aftereffects. iTBS produced inhibitory instead of facilitatory aftereffects and cTBS produced facilitatory instead of inhibitory aftereffects. Finger movements alone had no effects on MEPs size tested with single-pulse TMS. Peripheral electrical stimulation had no effect on iTBS-induced aftereffects. Repeated phasic finger movements interfere with TBS-induced aftereffects probably by modulating mechanisms of brain metaplasticity.", "pages": "2070-6"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Is this hand for real? Attenuation of the rubber hand illusion by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the inferior parietal lobule.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "18752397", "authors": ["Kammers, MP", "Verhagen, L", "Dijkerman, HC", "Hogendoorn, H", "De Vignemont, F", "Schutter, DJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), participants incorporate a rubber hand into a mental representation of one's body. This deceptive feeling of ownership is accompanied by recalibration of the perceived position of the participant's real hand toward the rubber hand. Neuroimaging data suggest involvement of the posterior parietal lobule during induction of the RHI, when recalibration of the real hand toward the rubber hand takes place. Here, we used off-line low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in a double-blind, sham-controlled within-subjects design to investigate the role of the inferior posterior parietal lobule (IPL) in establishing the RHI directly. Results showed that rTMS over the IPL attenuated the strength of the RHI for immediate perceptual body judgments only. In contrast, delayed perceptual responses were unaffected. Furthermore, ballistic action responses as well as subjective self-reports of feeling of ownership over the rubber hand remained unaffected by rTMS over the IPL. These findings are in line with previous research showing that the RHI can be broken down into dissociable bodily sensations. The illusion does not merely affect the embodiment of the rubber hand but also influences the experience and localization of one's own hand in an independent manner. Finally, the present findings concur with a multicomponent model of somatosensory body representations, wherein the IPL plays a pivotal role in subserving perceptual body judgments, but not actions or higher-order affective bodily judgments.", "pages": "2070-6"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "Known, forgotten and rediscovered--electricity and the brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "18751558", "authors": ["George, MS"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "Viewing images of other humans in pain elicits a variety of responses including distress, anxiety, and a sensation that is similar to pain. We aimed to evaluate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could be effective in modulating the emotional aspects of pain as to further explore mechanisms of tDCS in pain relief. Twenty-three healthy subjects rated images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain (baseline), and then received stimulation with tDCS under four different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), occipital cortex (V1); and sham tDCS. The order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. During each stimulation session (after 3 min of stimulation), subjects were shown a new set of aversive images and were again asked to rate the images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain. The results showed that ratings of unpleasantness and discomfort/pain were significantly decreased during DLPFC tDCS only, as compared to baseline and sham tDCS. The other conditions of stimulation (M1 and V1 tDCS) did not result in any significant changes. These results support the notion that DLPFC is a critical area for the emotional processing of pain and also suggests that DLPFC may be a potential target of stimulation for alleviation of pain with a significant emotional-affective component. Our results also suggest that the mechanism of tDCS in modulating emotional pain involve pathways that are independent of those modulating the somatosensory perception of pain.", "pages": "2070-6"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Modulation of emotions associated with images of human pain using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18725237", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Zaghi, S", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is a widely used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measure to assess inhibition in human motor cortex.
