Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the human primary motor cortex (MI) evokes motor responses in the contralateral limb muscles. The latencies and amplitudes of those responses depend on the direction of induced current in the brain by the stimuli (Mills et al. 1992, Werhahn et al. 1994). This observation suggests that different neural elements might be activated by the differently directed induced currents. Using a figure-of-eight-shaped coil, which induces current with a certain direction, we analyzed the effect of direction of stimulating current on the latencies of responses to TMS in normal subjects. The latencies were measured from surface electromyographic responses of the first dorsal interosseous muscles and the peaks in the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of single motor units from the same muscles. The coil was placed over the MI, with eight different directions each separated by 45 degrees. Stimulus intensity was adjusted just above the motor threshold while subjects made a weak tonic voluntary contraction, so that we can analyse the most readily elicited descending volley in the pyramidal tracts. In most subjects, TMS with medially and anteriorly directed current in the brain produced responses or a peak that occurred some 1.5 ms later than those to anodal electrical stimulation. In contrast, TMS with laterally and posteriorly directed current produced responses or a peak that occurred about 4.5 ms later. There was a single peak in most of PSTHs under the above stimulation condition, whereas there were occasionally two peaks under the transitional current directions between the above two groups. These results suggest that TMS with medially and anteriorly directed current in the brain readily elicits I1 waves, whereas that with laterally and posteriorly directed current preferentially elicits I3 waves. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies indicated that this direction was related to the course of the central sulcus. TMS with induced current flowing forward relative to the central sulcus preferentially elicited I1 waves and that flowing backward elicited I3 waves. Our finding of the dependence of preferentially activated I waves on the current direction in the brain suggests that different sets of cortical neurons are responsible for different I waves, and are contrarily oriented. The present method using a figure-of-eight-shaped coil must enable us to study physiological characteristics of each I wave separately and, possibly, analyse different neural elements in MI, since it activates a certain I wave selectively without D waves or other I waves.", "pages": "24-32"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Efficacy of transcranial motor-evoked myogenic potentials to detect spinal cord ischemia during operations for thoracoabdominal aneurysms.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9011706", "authors": ["de Haan, P", "Kalkman, CJ", "de Mol, BA", "Ubags, LH", "Veldman, DJ", "Jacobs, MJ"], "year": "1997", "journal": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "abstract": "Motor-evoked myogenic potentials after transcranial electrical stimulation monitor the vulnerable motoneuronal system of the spinal cord.

Ten postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant candidates were studied. Standard psychophysical parameters were obtained from patients undergoing PES and PTES. A more subjective form of evaluation was conducted for TMS. Subsequently, nine patients received the multichannel Nucleus (Cochlear Corp., Denver, CO, U.S.A.) implant and one patient a Clarion (Advanced Bionics, Sylmar, CA, U.S.A.) implant. Compared with PES. PTES elicited increased threshold responses with similar dynamic ranges between 50 and 400 Hz of stimulation. The differences were, by and large, insignificant. PTES appeared to be a useful alternative in selected individuals owing to its noninvasiveness. TMS, on the other hand, was incapable of clearly inducing auditory percepts.

The latency of antidromic corticospinal volleys evoked from the pyramid and recorded from the motor cortex decreased dramatically during the first postnatal months. Our data predict that conduction velocity (CV) of the fastest corticospinal neurons over their cranial course would reach adult values at approximately 11 months. The CV of corticospinal neurons in the spinal cord increased with age but with a slower time course. In the neonate, the fastest spinal CV was estimated at 7.8 m/sec, approximately 10 times slower than in adults (mean 80.0 m/sec). Our data predict that full myelination of corticospinal axons in the spinal cord would not occur until approximately 36 months. No short-latency EMG responses were elicited in arm and hand muscles by TMS until 3 months of age; TMS thresholds were high initially and then fell progressively with age. When corrected for body size, relative latencies of EMG responses showed an exponential decrease during the first postnatal months. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that fine finger movements are not observed before functional CM connections are well established and that rapid changes in the physiological properties of the corticospinal system coincide with the period in which precision grip is known to mature (3-6 months). However, corticospinal development continues long after simple measures of dexterity indicate functional maturity, and these changes may contribute to the improved speed and coordination of skilled hand tasks.", "pages": "24-32"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in psychiatric research.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "1282453", "authors": ["Puri, BK", "Lewis, SW"], "year": "1996", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "Evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCPs) from the cervical epidural space and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the hand muscles were recorded simultaneously in 6 subjects following transcranial magnetic stimulation in two different coil orientations on motor cortex. The onset latency of the MEPs was approximately 1 ms shorter when the induced current flowed in a latero-medial direction (L-M stimulation) on the motor cortex as compared to a postero-anterior direction (P-A stimulation). Hence, L-M stimulation elicited an earlier component of the ESCPs than that induced by P-A stimulation. During general anesthesia with Sevoflurane, only the first component of the ESCPs could be elicited routinely following L-M stimulation. In contrast, all components of the ESCPs were dramatically attenuated following P-A stimulation. Moreover, first component latency of the ESCPs induced by L-M stimulation was almost the same as that induced by transcranial anodal electrical stimulation. These results suggest that if the induced current following transcranial magnetic stimulation flows in a latero-medial direction on motor cortex, it preferentially stimulates the corticospinal tract non-synaptically (producing a D-wave). However, if the induced current flows in a postero-anterior direction, it preferentially stimulates the corticospinal tract trans-synaptically (producing I-waves). Therefore, the direction of magnetically induced current is crucial in determining corticospinal excitability in the human brain.", "pages": "24-32"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Optimum stimulus parameters for lateralized suppression of speech with magnetic brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "1349424", "authors": ["Epstein, CM", "Lah, JJ", "Meador, K", "Weissman, JD", "Gaitan, LE", "Dihenia, B"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate interhemispheric transcallosal connections between primary motor cortices noninvasively in awake human subjects. For this purpose, focal transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed on eight healthy, right-handed subjects and one patient with congenital collosal agenesis. Using two magnetic stimulators, we investigated the effect of a conditioning magnetic stimulus applied to the motor cortex of one hemisphere on the duration of the silent period (SP) evoked in the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle by a magnetic test stimulus given over the opposite motor cortex. It is well established that SP reflects activation of inhibitory interneurons within primary motor cortex. In all normal subjects, a conditioning stimulus to one hemisphere produced a significant shortening of SP evoked by the test stimulus when the conditioning-test-interval was 10-20 ms. The effect was also observed when an electrical test stimulus was used. The conditioning coil had to be placed over the hand motor area to obtain the maximal effect. The threshold for eliciting this decrease of SP duration was higher than the threshold for eliciting an early excitatory muscle response in the contralateral FDI. Increasing the intensity of the conditioning stimulus led to linear reduction of SP duration. In the patient with callosal agenesis, no such decreasing effect on SP duration was observed. These results suggest that inhibitory interneurons within primary hand motor cortex receive transcallosal inhibitory input from the opposite motor cortex. We propose that modulation of motor cortical interneurons via transcallosal pathways may provide a gain control for the motor cortical output system and subserve interhemispheric coordination in complex, nonsymmetrical bimanual movements.", "pages": "24-32"}, {"volume": "61", "title": "Significance of sympathetic skin response in the assessment of autonomic failure in patients with spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1431984", "authors": ["Curt, A", "Weinhardt, C", "Dietz, V"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Journal of the autonomic nervous system", "abstract": "Transcranial double magnetic stimulation on the motor cortex was used to investigate central motor tract function in 16 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, five with spinal muscular atrophy, and 16 age matched normal controls.", "pages": "24-32"}]
