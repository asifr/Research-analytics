Repetitive electrical peripheral nerve or muscle stimulation can induce a lasting increase in the excitability of the corticomotor projection. By pairing peripheral stimulation with transcranial magnetic brain stimulation it is possible to shorten the duration of stimulation needed to induce this effect. This ability to induce excitability changes in the motor cortex may be of significance for the rehabilitation of brain-injured patients. The mechanisms responsible for the increases in excitability have not been investigated thoroughly. 2. Using two paired transcranial magnetic stimuli protocols we investigated the excitability of intracortical inhibitory and excitatory systems before and following a period of repetitive dual muscle and brain stimulation. The dual stimulation consisted of motor point stimulation of first dorsal interosseous (FDI; 10 Hz trains of 1 ms square waves for 500 ms) delivered at one train every 10 s, paired with single transcranial magnetic stimulation given 25 ms after the onset of the train. 3. Following 30 min of dual stimulation, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were significantly increased in amplitude. During this period of MEP facilitation there was no significant difference in the level of intracortical inhibition. There was, however, a significant increase in the intracortical facilitation demonstrated with paired magnetic stimuli. The increase in facilitation was seen only at short interstimulus intervals (0.8-2.0 ms). These intervals comprised a peak in the time course of facilitation, which is thought to reflect I wave interaction within the motor cortex. 4. The relevance of this finding to the MEP facilitation seen following dual peripheral and central stimulation is discussed.", "pages": "623-31"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Modulation of spinal cord excitability by subthreshold repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "17", "pmid": "8120818", "authors": ["Valero-Cabr\u00e9, A", "Oliveri, M", "Gangitano, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) allows the modulation of intra-cortical excitability and may therefore affect the descending control of spinal excitability.

Following rTMS, H wave thresholds significantly reduced by approximately 20%. Maximal H but not M wave amplitude significantly increased over the baseline, so that H/M amplitude ratio was increased by 41%. Sham stimulation did not induce any noticeable change in M or H waves.

Sleep deprivation activates EEG epileptiform activity in an unknown way. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can inform on the excitability of the primary motor cortex. Eight healthy subjects (four men and four women) were studied. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (single and paired) was performed by a focal coil over the primary motor cortex, at the \"hot spot\" for the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. The following motor evoked potential features were measured: (a) active and resting threshold to stimulation; (b) duration of the silent period; (c) amount of intracortical inhibition on paired TMS at the interstimulus intervals of 2 and 3 ms and amount of facilitation at interstimulus intervals of 14 and 16 ms. The whole TMS session was repeated after a sleep deprivation of at least 24 hours. After the sleep deprivation, the threshold to stimulation (in the active and resting muscle), as well as the silent period, did not change significantly. By contrast, the paired stimulus study showed a significant (p<0.05) reduction in both intracortical inhibition and facilitation. Thus, TMS showed that sleep deprivation is associated with changes in inhibition-facilitation balance in the primary motor cortex of normal subjects. These changes might have a link with the background factors of the \"activating\" effects of sleep deprivation.", "pages": "623-31"}, {"volume": "193", "title": "Cortical silent period in the tongue induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8930851", "authors": ["Katayama, T", "Aizawa, H", "Kuroda, K", "Suzuki, Y", "Kikuchi, K", "Kimura, T", "Hashimoto, K", "Yahara, O"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Although functional MRI is widely used for preoperative planning and intraoperative neuronavigation, its accuracy to depict the site of neuronal activity is not exactly known.
