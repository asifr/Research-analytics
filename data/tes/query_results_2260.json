In Experiment 1, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with a speech task to examine rTMS-induced changes in paralinguistic aspects of speech production, an affect-relevant behavior strongly linked to the ACC. In Experiment 2, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with positron emission tomography (PET) and used partial least squares (PLS) to identify a pattern of brain regions whose connectivity with the site of stimulation varied as a function of rTMS. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that following stimulation of the left MDLFC, subjects reported having less positive affect and vitality and displayed more monotonous speech. In Experiment 2, results revealed that 10-Hz rTMS influenced the covariation between blood flow at the site of stimulation (ie the left MDLFC) and blood flow in a number of affect-relevant brain regions including the perigenual anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in affect and affect-relevant behaviour following 10-Hz rTMS applied over the left MDLFC may be related to changes in neural activity in brain regions widely implicated in affective states, including a frontocingulate circuit.", "pages": "1172-89"}, {"volume": "158", "title": "Motor cortex inhibition induced by acoustic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15024542", "authors": ["K\u00fchn, AA", "Sharott, A", "Trottenberg, T", "Kupsch, A", "Brown, P"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

A new approach to investigate this interaction in man is combining acoustic stimulation activating the startle system with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex. However, it is unclear whether the inhibition of TMS responses following acoustic stimulation occurs at the level of the motor cortex through reticulo-cortical projections or subcortically, perhaps through reticulo-spinal projections. We compared the influence of acoustic stimulation on motor effects elicited by TMS over motor cortical areas to those evoked with subcortical electrical stimulation (SES) through depth electrodes in five patients treated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. SES bypasses the motor cortex, demonstrating any interaction with acoustic stimuli at the subcortical level. EMG was recorded from the contralateral biceps brachii muscle. Acoustic stimulation was delivered binaurally through headphones and used as a conditioning stimulus at an interstimulus interval of 50 ms. When TMS was used as the test stimulus, the area and amplitude of the conditioned motor response was significantly inhibited (area: 57.5+/-12.9%, amplitude: 47.9+/-7.4%, as percentage of unconditioned response) whereas facilitation occurred with SES (area: 110.1+/-4.3%, amplitude: 116.9+/-6.9%). We conclude that a startle-evoked activation of reticulo-cortical projections transiently inhibits the motor cortex.", "pages": "1172-89"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Depression of diaphragm motor cortex excitability during mechanical ventilation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15020575", "authors": ["Sharshar, T", "Ross, ET", "Hopkinson, NS", "Porcher, R", "Nickol, AH", "Jonville, S", "Dayer, MJ", "Hart, N", "Moxham, J", "Lofaso, F", "Polkey, MI"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "The effect of mechanical ventilation on the diaphragm motor cortex remains unknown. We assessed the effect of mechanical ventilation on diaphragm motor cortex excitability by measuring the costal and crural diaphragm motor-evoked potential (MEP) elicited by single and paired transcranial magnetic stimulation. In six healthy subjects, MEP recruitment curves of the costal and crural diaphragms were assessed at relaxed end expiration during spontaneous breathing [baseline tidal volume (Vt(baseline))] and isocapnic volume cycled ventilation delivered noninvasively (NIV) at three different levels of tidal volume (Vt(baseline), Vt(baseline) + 5 ml/kg liters, and Vt(baseline) + 10 ml/kg liters). The costal and crural diaphragm response to peripheral stimulation of the right phrenic nerve was not reduced by NIV. NIV reduced the costal and crural MEP amplitude during NIV (P < 0.0001) with the maximal reduction at Vt(baseline) + 5 ml/kg. Response to paired TMS showed that NIV (Vt(baseline) + 5 ml/kg) significantly increased the sensitivity of the cortical motoneurons to facilitatory (>9 ms) interstimulus intervals (P = 0.002), suggesting that the diaphragm MEP amplitude depression during NIV is related to neuromechanical inhibition at the level of motor cortex. Our results demonstrate that mechanical ventilation directly inhibits central projections to the diaphragm.", "pages": "1172-89"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "rTMS reduces focal brain hyperperfusion in two patients with EPC.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15016013", "authors": ["Graff-Guerrero, A", "Gonz\u00e1les-Olvera, J", "Ruiz-Garc\u00eda, M", "Avila-Ordo\u00f1ez, U", "Vaugier, V", "Garc\u00eda-Reyna, JC"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the acute effect of a single repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) session in a focal hyperperfusion epileptogenic region to induce a transitory decrease of epileptiform activity.", "pages": "1172-89"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "EEG-dependent ERP recording: using TMS to increase the incidence of a selected pre-stimulus pattern.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15013465", "authors": ["Price, GW"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Brain research.

This form of recording is critically dependent upon the incidence of the particular pattern of interest. We introduce here a process that modifies the EEG in a predictable manner so as to increase the incidence of a particular pattern. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimuli are applied in response to a selected pattern of pre-TMS activity, and the post-TMS response is characterized by the incidence of a defined pattern of EEG activity. Analysis of validation test results obtained with the TMS modification part of the process verifies an increased incidence of the response pattern after TMS stimuli, compared with placebo stimuli. The TMS modification procedure is then combined with interactive ERP recording in a two step process to affect the ERP response to sensory stimuli. The post-TMS pattern from the first step becomes the pre-stimulus pattern of the interactive ERP recording in the second step. The TMS modified interactive ERP (TMIERP) process is illustrated here using an auditory oddball paradigm. The amplitude of the P300 peak obtained using this process was significantly higher than that obtained using the standard auditory oddball paradigm.", "pages": "1172-89"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "A network model of perceptual suppression induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15006098", "authors": ["Miyawaki, Y", "Okada, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neural computation", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been suggested for the treatment of a variety of CNS disorders including depression and mania.", "pages": "1172-89"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Visual enhancing of tactile perception in the posterior parietal cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15006033", "authors": ["Ro, T", "Wallace, R", "Hagedorn, J", "Farn\u00e8, A", "Pienkos, E"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Nine bipolar (I) in-patients diagnosed with mania were treated with right prefrontal rapid TMS in an open and prospective study.
