Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques", "abstract": "Tinnitus is a very frequent symptom affecting 10% of the general population. It corresponds to the perception of an internal noise that can severely impair the quality of life. Tinnitus management requires a multidisciplinary approach in which neuromodulation and neurosurgery tend to play major roles. Classification of tinnitus separates objective tinnitus (i.e., tinnitus that can be heard or recorded) from the more frequent subjective tinnitus (i.e., tinnitus only perceived by the patient). Objective tinnitus is either pulsatile synchronous with heartbeat or asynchronous. In the former, appropriate radiological testing should search for a vascular abnormality as well as other neurological diseases (intracranial hypertension, Arnold-Chiari malformation, vascular loops, etc.). Asynchronous objective tinnitus generally corresponds to muscular contractions that require specific management. The pathophysiology of subjective tinnitus is more complex, showing strong analogies with postamputation pain syndromes. After peripheral middle ear or inner ear damage, auditory deafferentation could result in hyperactivity and/or functional reorganization within central auditory and nonauditory structures. This could explain the persistence of tinnitus after total hearing amputation (e.g., translabyrinthine approach for vestibular schwannoma) and associated symptoms such as hyperacusis or anxiety and depression. This central model finds strong support in animal experiments and in functional neuroimagery (PET, fMRI, MEG). Since no etiologically based therapies are currently available, severe subjective tinnitus management only targets tinnitus tolerance with sound enrichment or cognitive behavior therapy. However, in the near future better knowledge of tinnitus pathophysiology and innovative therapeutic tools could emerge from neuromodulation techniques such as repeated transcranial magnetic or epidural electric stimulation.", "pages": "820-6"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Using non-invasive brain stimulation to augment motor training-induced plasticity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19292910", "authors": ["Bolognini, N", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation", "abstract": "Periventricular leukomalacia is characterized by damage to the brain's white matter and impairments in motor function.

It is suggested that after a lesion of the right hemisphere the mutual transcallosal inhibition is impaired, resulting in an increased activity of the left hemisphere. We investigated the interhemispheric balance of attention in healthy subjects by using a free visual exploration task and by interfering with the neural activity of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of either hemisphere using an inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation routine with theta burst stimulation (TBS). Subjects explored colour photographs of real-life scenes presented on a computer screen under four conditions: (i) without TBS; (ii) after TBS over the right PPC; (iii) after TBS over the left PPC; and (iv) after TBS over the right PPC and, after the first half of the task, over the left PPC. Eye movements were measured, and distribution of mean cumulative fixation duration over screen halves was analyzed. TBS over the right PPC resulted in a significant rightward shift of mean cumulative fixation duration of approximately 30 min. The shift could be reversed when a subsequent train of TBS was applied over the left PPC. However, left PPC stimulation alone had no significant effect on visual exploration behaviour. The present study shows that the effect of TBS on the PPC depends on which hemisphere is stimulated and on the state of the contralateral homologue area. These findings are in accordance with the predictions of the interhemispheric rivalry model in neglect.", "pages": "820-6"}, {"volume": "84", "title": "Recruitment of motor cortex inhibition differentiates between generalized and focal epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "10590969", "authors": ["Klimpe, S", "Behrang-Nia, M", "Bott, MC", "Werhahn, KJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to evaluate motor cortical excitability changes in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and their asymptomatic siblings (AS) using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS). 21 patients with JME and their 21 AS were compared to 20 healthy controls. All of JME patients were receiving antiepileptic therapy and their seizures were well controlled. Firstly, standard EEG examinations and then TMS studies were performed. Resting motor threshold (RMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, the durations of central motor conduction time (CMCT) and cortical silent period (CSP) were measured. After TMS studies, EEG recordings were repeated in an hour to evaluate any effect of TMS study on EEG. There were no significant differences between the first and second EEG recordings. No seizures were recorded during and after the TMS study. RMT was found higher in JME patients than AS and normal controls. There were no significant differences between cortical MEP amplitudes and MEP amplitude/CMAP (compound muscle action potential) amplitude ratio in all three groups. CMCT duration was shorter in JME patients than AS. CSP durations of JME patients were found to be longer than controls. In AS, CSP durations were also found to be longer than controls but this difference was not found statistically significant. Our results suggested that although high MT may be related to antiepileptic therapy, the prolongation of CSP duration may reflect impairment of supraspinal and/or intracortical inhibitory mechanism in JME. To eliminate the drug effect, further studies are needed in newly diagnosed JME patients without medication and large series of their asymptomatic siblings.", "pages": "820-6"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in severe, drug-resistant major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "11811254", "authors": ["Ferrucci, R", "Bortolomasi, M", "Vergari, M", "Tadini, L", "Salvoro, B", "Giacopuzzi, M", "Barbieri, S", "Priori, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "abstract": "Neurovascular compression (NVC) may cause cranial mononeuropathy but lacks a definitive diagnostic investigation.
