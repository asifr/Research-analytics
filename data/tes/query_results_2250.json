However, the mechanism of modulating excitability by rTMS is unclear. We examined the changes in high frequency oscillations (HFOs) of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) before and after slow rTMS over the right primary somatosensory cortex (0.5 Hz, 50 pulses, 80% motor threshold intensity). The HFOs, which represent a localized activity of intracortical inhibitory interneurons, were significantly increased after slow rTMS, while the SEPs were not changed. Our results suggest that slow rTMS affects cortical excitability by modulating the activity of the intracortical inhibitory interneurons beyond the time of the stimulation and that rTMS may have therapeutic effects on such disorders.", "pages": "193-6"}, {"volume": "148", "title": "[Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression; stimulation of the brain in order to cure the psyche].", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "15038199", "authors": ["Helmich, RC", "Snijders, AH", "Verkes, RJ", "Bloem, BR"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive approach to briefly stimulate or inhibit cortical brain areas. A novel approach entails the delivery of repetitive TMS pulses (rTMS) at a fixed frequency. In rTMS cortical activity is altered beyond the period of actual stimulation. The changes occur locally as well as at a distance in functionally connected brain areas. These features render rTMS a suitable tool to study normal brain functions and the pathophysiology of brain diseases. Furthermore, it is expected that rTMS could be used as a novel therapy for neurological or psychiatric diseases characterised by abnormal cortical activation. This possibility has been studied mostly in patients suffering from depression, where rTMS has been used to restore normal activity in the hypoactive prefrontal cortex. Despite statistically significant therapeutic effects in small sized trials, the clinical implications are still limited.", "pages": "193-6"}, {"volume": "148", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation: a fascinating development].", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "15038198", "authors": ["Koerselman, GF"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a novel technique for safely stimulating or inhibiting cortical brain functions.

We herein investigated the possibility of neurological dysfunction in early-treated patients. In the study, 12 early-treated 6PTPS patients were studied. Their auditory simple reaction time, movement rhythm variation (MRV), somatosensory evoked potentials to median nerve stimulation, and hand muscle responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation, were measured. MRV is a test of repetitive voluntary movements, and was used with and without auditory cues at 0.3 Hz. The 6PTPS patients had an increased motor threshold but normal motor and sensory central conduction times. They performed very well in simple reactions (6PTPS 208.4+/-16.7 ms, control 200.3+/-11.7 ms, p=0.18), but not in continuous tasks. The continuous performance tests showed that MRV had increased in the 6PTPS patients (with cues: 6PTPS 7.35+/-0.94, control 5.47+/-0.80, p<0.0001; without cues: 6PTPS 9.87+/-1.44, control 6.59+/-0.68, p<0.0001). Without cues, MRV had increased in both the 6PTPS and control groups, but more significantly in the 6PTPS patients (6PTPS 2.51+/-0.97, control 1.25+/-0.42; p=0.0001). Our findings indicate that early-treated 6PTPS patients have subtle neurological dysfunctions. They may not maintain movement rhythm as well as normal subjects, even with external cues. Hence, MRV is a good method to assess motor control.", "pages": "193-6"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "Distinct differences in cortical reactivity of motor and prefrontal cortices to magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15038199", "authors": ["K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, S", "Wilenius, J", "Komssi, S", "Ilmoniemi, RJ"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The stimulus intensity of prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is usually determined with respect to the motor threshold (MT).
