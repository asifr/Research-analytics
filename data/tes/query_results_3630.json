In contrast to electrical stimulation, magnetic impulses are not painful and offer the advantage of a selective activation of motor systems. Applications of the method in Orthopaedics involve perioperative control of motor capacity, description of radicular motor damage and the diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions.

Supplement", "abstract": "Transcranial stimulation offers the opportunity to replace a standard clinical method of invasive brain cortical mapping. A figure '8' magnetic coil with a 1-3-cm area of stimulation is combined with a new method of creating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans which represent the cortical surface (mapping cuts) and thus establishing common landmarks between the MRI and the scalp for cortical mapping. This assigns gyral sights to scalp sites of transcranial stimulation. We report the development and evaluation of these techniques in 6 normals and 10 patients. Cortical maps were shown to enlarge during voluntary contraction. They were variable between individuals, as reported for direct cortical mapping. Maps showed a degree of short and longer term consistency within an individual. The maps were influenced by lesions. They also provided clinical information of the relation of functioning cortex to brain tumors that could influence clinical management including surgical decisions. A consideration of safety of the method in comparison to direct brain stimulation indicates that it falls within existing parameters for electrical stimulation of the brain, and could reduce the risks of the present standard by lowering charge density and the need for invasive methods. Broader application could lead to development of functional imaging methods, which would be a useful preoperative planning tool and investigative method.", "pages": "6-11"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve: where is the actual excitation site?", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "1773775", "authors": ["R\u00f6sler, KM", "Schmid, UD", "Hess, CW"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology.

The results of both approaches of this study led independently to the conclusion that magnetic stimulation acts within the proximal part of the facial canal.

Supplement", "abstract": "It is suggested that transcranial electric stimulation can activate pyramidal tract projections both directly and indirectly in a manner similar to that described after direct stimulation of the exposed cortex in the monkey. This produces both D- and I-waves in the pyramidal tract. At high intensities of stimulation, the stimulus can spread into the brain and activate pyramidal tract axons several centimeters below the cortical surface. Magnetic stimulation at moderate intensities produces electromyographic (EMG) responses with latencies 1-2 msec longer than those after electric stimulation. Two possible explanations have been put forward to account for this effect: (1) because of the difference in the direction of electric current flow induced in the brain by the 2 forms of stimulation, magnetic stimulation preferentially excites pyramidal tract cells indirectly, and hence evokes only I-waves in the pyramidal tract. (2) Electric stimulation (even at threshold) activates pyramidal axons deep in the white matter, whereas magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal cells in the gray matter, probably at their initial segment. There is one interesting consequence common to both explanations. Whether magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically or at their initial segment, the size of the descending volley evoked will depend on the level of excitability of the motor cortex. In contrast, the response to electric stimulation will be less affected, since a proportion of the descending volley is initiated directly at the axon of the pyramidal cell. This differential effect of cortical excitability on the responses to electrical and magnetic stimulation can be useful in describing excitatory or inhibitory influences on motor cortex from other structures.", "pages": "6-11"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Magnetic stimulation: technical aspects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "1773762", "authors": ["Claus, D"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology. Supplement", "abstract": "When the voltage induced in a measuring coil by different magnetic stimulators was assessed, the strongest stimulus was generated by Cadwell followed by Novametrix, Dantec and then Digitimer. The Cadwell produced a polyphasic pulse, while the other stimulators generated monophasic stimuli. This is the reason that reversing coil polarity does not influence the site of nerve excitation with the Cadwell equipment, but does with the other stimulators. The magnetic method has proved to be most useful for transcranial excitation of the motor cortex. Magnetic stimuli at C7 excite cervical roots submaximally. Electrical stimuli excite cervical roots supermaximally. No advantage was found in the use of small coils for cervical transcutaneous root stimulation. Electrical stimulation (60-85% output) excited lumbar motor roots supramaximally in each healthy subject. However, magnetic stimulation at T12/L1 (100% output) evoked responses in only 8 (Novametrix) and 12 (Cadwell) out of 18 trials without any difference between right and left.

Supplement", "abstract": "The influence of afferent median nerve stimulation on the responses of small hand muscles (CMAPs) to cortical stimulation (CortStim) was investigated by applying short stimulus trains to the median nerve at the wrist and slightly suprathreshold magnetic stimuli to the scalp. Train stimulus frequency (TSF), train stimulus intensity (TSI), and train onset (TO) in relation to the CortStim were varied. Amplitudes and latencies of CMAPs were compared with those obtained by CortStim alone. When applying short trains of 10 msec duration, of 300/sec-400/sec TSF, and of threshold or supramaximal intensity for motor fibers, both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on the responses to CortStim were achieved depending on the timing of the train onset. With a TO of 8-10 msec before CortStim, mean amplitudes of CMAPs were enhanced 3-10 times; mean amplitudes reached up to 20 times the baseline values when the TO was greater than 45 msec before CortStim. With a TO of 15-35 msec before CortStim, amplitudes were diminished below control values. No systematic changes in latency were noted with TO of 8-10 msec, but when the TO was 45-60 msec before CortStim the latencies of CMAPs were 1.5-3 msec shorter than baseline latencies. With afferent stimuli that were subthreshold for motor fibers facilitation only occurred when the TO was about 45 msec before CortStim. The differences were statistically significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test). This biphasic pattern of facilitation and inhibition probably reflects spinal and supraspinal reflex phenomena mediated by spindle receptor and various cutaneous afferents.", "pages": "6-11"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Corticospinal potentials after electrical and magnetic stimulation in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "1773754", "authors": ["Berardelli, A", "Inghilleri, M", "Cruccu, G", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology.

We discuss the differences of these two techniques specifically as regards the latency and amplitude of evoked potentials. In both cases, electrodes were placed either in the epidural space or directly on the spinal cord. Following electrical stimulation, the descending volley consisted of an early wave which appeared at low stimulation intensity and increased in amplitude and decreased in latency when the strength of the stimulus was increased. At high stimulation intensities the early wave was followed by later waves which travel at the same speed as the initial wave. By delivering paired cortical stimuli, the early wave evoked by the test stimuli is present at 1-msec interval and progressively recovered with longer intervals. The recovery cycle of the later waves is also extremely short. Following magnetic stimulation, the descending volley also consisted of an initial wave followed by later waves. The initial wave has a slightly longer latency, a higher threshold and a smaller amplitude than the early wave evoked by electrical stimulation. The results are discussed with reference to the D and I waves recorded from the pyramidal tract in animals.", "pages": "6-11"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Impairment of visual perception and visual short term memory scanning by transcranial magnetic stimulation of occipital cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1769392", "authors": ["Beckers, G", "H\u00f6mberg, V"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The identification of trigrams, presented for 14 ms in horizontal or vertical arrays was significantly impaired when the visual stimulus preceded the occipital magnetic shock by 40 to 120 ms. The extent of impairment was related to TMS intensity. The latency of perceptual impairment was shorter for more intense TMS. No perceptual impairment was obtained by \"sham\" stimulation when TMS shocks were applied to the upper cervical region rather than the occipital region to rule out unspecific startle reactions affecting attention possibly responsible for the observed reduction in performance. Occipital TMS did not evoke systematic eye movements except for blink responses at latencies beyond 40 ms which were too late to interfere with visual input. Depending on the required serial order of readout of the trigram perceptual impairment was more marked for the second and third part of the trigram. This demonstrates that TMS interferes with the internal serial processing of visual input. To elucidate this further, TMS was used in a Sternberg short term visual memory scanning task. TMS caused a marked decrease in memory scanning rates whereas visual stimulus encoding and storage remained unaffected when tested at various TMS delays. TMS appears to be a useful method to study processes of visual perception and short term memory handling in the occipital cortex.

After magnetic stimulation with a large coil, motor evoked potentials were present in about 20% of relaxed and 100% of contracting neck muscles.

Subtraction of the M-wave latency after stimulation of the accessory nerve at the skull base resulted in a central latency of about 4.5 ms. We suggest that rapid cortical projections connect with neck muscle motoneurons mono or disynaptically. The latency difference between the responses after electrical and magnetic stimulation was smaller in neck than in limb muscles but similar to that seen in masticatory muscles. A small magnetic coil was used to study the pattern of functional lateralization of cortical projections to neck muscle motoneurons; the projections for the sternomastoid and splenius are bilateral but predominantly contralateral, whereas those for the trapezius are exclusively contralateral.", "pages": "6-11"}]
