Functional electrical stimulation therapy is known to enhance the motor function of the paretic hand; however, the mechanism of this enhancement is not known. We studied whether neural plasticity has a role in this therapy-induced enhancement of the hand motor function in 20 hemiparetic subjects with chronic stroke (age 53 \u00b1 6 years; 7 females and 13 males; 10 with cerebral infarction and 10 with cerebral haemorrhage; and time since incident 2.4 \u00b1 2.0 years). These subjects were randomized to functional electrical therapy or conventional physiotherapy group. Both groups received upper limb treatment (twice daily sessions) for two weeks. Behavioral hand motor function and neurophysiologic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) tests were applied before and after the treatment and at 6-months follow-up. TMS is useful in assessing excitability changes in the primary motor cortex. Faster corticospinal conduction and newly found muscular responses were observed in the paretic upper limb in the functional electrical therapy group but not in the conventional therapy group after the intervention. Behaviourally, faster movement times were observed in the functional electrical therapy group but not in the conventionally treated group. Despite the small number of heterogeneous subjects, functional exercise augmented with individualized electrical therapy of the paretic upper limb may enhance neuroplasticity, observed as corticospinal facilitation, in chronic stroke subjects, along with moderate improvements in the voluntary motor control of the affected limb.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Frequency-dependent tuning of the human motor system induced by transcranial oscillatory potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "34", "pmid": "21865459", "authors": ["Feurra, M", "Bianco, G", "Santarnecchi, E", "Del Testa, M", "Rossi, A", "Rossi, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Different corticothalamic brain modules intrinsically oscillate at a \"natural frequency\" in a topographically organized manner.

Here, we showed that the transcranial application of an imperceptible, short-lasting (90 s) electric field oscillating at a physiological range increases corticospinal excitability online, with well defined frequency dependence and regional specificity. Indeed, the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by navigated single-pulse TMS over the motor cortex significantly increased only during the local application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 20 Hz (\u03b2 range). Other tACS frequencies (5, 10, and 40 Hz) applied on the motor cortex did not impact MEPs' size. Moreover, tACS applied on a control site (parietal cortex) and on a peripheral site (ulnar nerve) also failed to modulate MEPs. These results help clarifying the functional significance of the 20 Hz idling \u03b2 rhythm of sensorimotor regions and suggest potential clinical applications of this approach.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "201", "title": "Transcranial electrical stimulation of cortico-cortical connections in anesthetized mice.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "22238075", "authors": ["Hishida, R", "Watanabe, K", "Kudoh, M", "Shibuki, K"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "We developed a technique of transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) to investigate cortico-cortical connections in mice. After the skull was shaved with the blade of a dental bar, a blunt tip of a needle was gently pushed onto the thinned skull. The skull was deformed by the force, and the subarachnoid space between the skull and the cortex was minimized around the needle tip. Under these conditions, stimulus currents applied to the needle directly flowed into the cortex through the thinned skull. Cortico-cortical functional connections stimulated by this method were visualized by transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. The cortical responses evoked by TES exhibited spatial and temporal activity patterns comparable to those elicited by a conventional method, in which an electrode is directly inserted into superficial cortical layers. A comparison of the two methods revealed that TES required a slightly stronger stimulus intensity and preferentially activated superficial layers of the cortex compared with the conventional method. Using the new method, we revealed the presence of reciprocal cortico-cortical functional connections between lateral and medial parts of higher visual cortices in mice. This new method combined with transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging allowed us to activate cortico-cortical pathways arising from the primary sensory areas and investigate sensory information flow in the mouse cerebral cortex.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Ameliorating spatial neglect with non-invasive brain stimulation: from pathophysiological concepts to novel treatment strategies.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "21864574", "authors": ["Hesse, MD", "Sparing, R", "Fink, GR"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation", "abstract": "Neglect is a multifaceted, complex syndrome, in which patients fail to detect or respond to stimuli or parts thereof located contralesionally. Non-invasive brain stimulation by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may not only be useful as diagnostic research tools to explore the pathophysiology of neglect, but also for ameliorating its symptoms. Current approaches for modulating neglect non-invasively are mainly based on the neurophysiological concept of interhemispheric inhibition, which suggests a pathological overactivation of the contralesional hemisphere due to reduced inhibitory influences from the lesioned one. Within this framework, non-invasive brain stimulation mainly aims to inhibit the contralesional hemisphere to allow for rebalancing the system. However, facilitatory protocols for enhancing the ipsilesional neural circuitry might also prove useful. In this review, we discuss the contribution of non-invasive brain stimulation to current pathological concepts of neglect, the promising results of the proof-of-principle studies currently available as well as the specific aspects to be systematically investigated before broader clinical trials may eventually suggest a routine clinical application.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "225", "title": "Electrical stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) determines long-term effects in the recovery of speech apraxia in three chronic aphasics.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "21864198", "authors": ["Marangolo, P", "Marinelli, CV", "Bonifazi, S", "Fiori, V", "Ceravolo, MG", "Provinciali, L", "Tomaiuolo, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that modulating cortical activity by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects the performance of both healthy and brain-damaged subjects.

Over 2 weeks, three aphasic subjects participated in a randomized double-blinded experiment involving intensive language training for their articulatory difficulties in two tDCS conditions. Each subject participated in five consecutive daily sessions of anodic tDCS (20 min, 1 mA) and sham stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (referred to as Broca's area) while they performed a repetition task. By the end of each week, a significant improvement was found in both conditions. However, all three subjects showed greater response accuracy in the anodic than in the sham condition. Moreover, results for transfer of treatment effects, although different across subjects, indicate a generalization of the recovery at the language test. Subjects 2 and 3 showed a significant improvement in oral production tasks, such as word repetition and reading, while Subjects 1 and 2 had an unexpected significant recovery in written naming and word writing under dictation tasks. At three follow-ups (1 week, 1 and 2 months after the end of treatment), response accuracy was still significantly better in the anodic than in sham condition, suggesting a long-term effect on the recovery of their articulatory gestures.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does not affect perceptual filling-in in healthy volunteers.", "keywords": [], "issue": "18", "pmid": "21856336", "authors": ["Amiaz, R", "Zomet, A", "Polat, U"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Vision research", "abstract": "Collinear flankers increase the reports of the target present, an effect attributed to excitatory activation induced by the flankers on the target location, which consequently induces the filling-in effect (Polat & Sagi, 2007).

We explored how rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) affects filling-in perception in normal controls. Active and Sham rTMS were used over the DLPFC (90% of the subjects' motor threshold (MT)) using 10-Hz pulses for 5- and 20-s intertrain intervals. We used the filling-in paradigm to probe hit rates (pHit) and false-positive reports (false alarm, pFA). We found that the changes in the filling-in effect (pHit, pFA) were not significantly different between the groups. However, the reaction time (RT) was significantly reduced in the rTMS group but not in the Sham group.

Based on the standard two-stage memory model, we propose that memory consolidation during SWS represents a process of system consolidation which is orchestrated by the neocortical <1Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) slow oscillation and involves the reactivation of newly encoded representations and their subsequent redistribution from temporary hippocampal to neocortical long-term storage sites. Indeed, experimental induction of slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep by slowly alternating transcranial current stimulation distinctly improves consolidation of declarative memory. The slow oscillations temporally group neuronal activity into up-states of strongly enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. In a feed-forward efferent action, this grouping is induced not only in the neocortex but also in other structures relevant to consolidation, namely the thalamus generating 10-15Hz spindles, and the hippocampus generating sharp wave-ripples, with the latter well known to accompany a replay of newly encoded memories taking place in hippocampal circuitries. The feed-forward synchronizing effect of the slow oscillation enables the formation of spindle-ripple events where ripples and accompanying reactivated hippocampal memory information become nested into the single troughs of spindles. Spindle-ripple events thus enable reactivated memory-related hippocampal information to be fed back to neocortical networks in the excitable slow oscillation up-state where they can induce enduring plastic synaptic changes underlying the effective formation of long-term memories.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Modulating the brain at work using noninvasive transcranial stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "21854958", "authors": ["McKinley, RA", "Bridges, N", "Walters, CM", "Nelson, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "This paper proposes a shift in the way researchers currently view and use transcranial brain stimulation technologies. From a neuroscience perspective, the standard application of both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been mainly to explore the function of various brain regions. These tools allow for noninvasive and painless modulation of cortical tissue. In the course of studying the function of an area, many studies often report enhanced performance of a task during or following the stimulation. However, little follow-up research is typically done to further explore these effects. Approaching this growing pool of cognitive neuroscience literature with a neuroergonomics mindset (i.e., studying the brain at work), the possibilities of using these stimulation techniques for more than simply investigating the function of cortical areas become evident. In this paper, we discuss how cognitive neuroscience brain stimulation studies may complement neuroergonomics research on human performance optimization. And, through this discussion, we hope to shift the mindset of viewing transcranial stimulation techniques as solely investigatory basic science tools or possible clinical therapeutic devices to viewing transcranial stimulation techniques as interventional tools to be incorporated in applied science research and systems for the augmentation and enhancement of human operator performance.", "pages": "71-6"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Is rTMS an effective therapeutic strategy that can be used to treat Parkinson's disease?", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "21840408", "authors": ["Arias-Carrion, O", "Machado, S", "Paes, F", "Velasques, B", "Teixeira, S", "Cardenas-Morales, L", "Piedade, R", "Ribeiro, P", "Nardi, AE"], "year": "2011", "journal": "CNS & neurological disorders drug targets", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive procedure whereby a pulsed magnetic field stimulates electrical activity in the brain.

In the present study we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left DLPFC to investigate whether transiently increasing the activity of this region resulted in changes in the ratings of positive, neutral and negative emotional pictures. Results revealed that anodal, but not cathodal, tDCS reduced the perceived degree of emotional valence for negative stimuli, possibly due to an enhancement of cognitive control of emotional expression. We also aimed to determine whether personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) might condition the impact of tDCS. We found that individuals with higher scores on the introversion personality dimension were more permeable than extraverts to the modulatory effects of the stimulation.
