One property still debated and contested is the puzzling absence of phenomenal visual percepts of visual stimuli that can be detected with perfect accuracy. We investigated the possibility that phenomenal visual percepts of exogenous visual stimuli in patient GY might be induced by using transcranial direct current stimulation. High contrast and low contrast stimuli were presented as a moving grating in his blind hemifield. When left area MT/V5 was anodally stimulated during the presentation of high-contrast gratings, he never reported a phenomenal percept of a moving grating but showed perfect blindsight performance. When applied along with low contrast gratings, for which accuracy was titrated to 60-70\u00a0%, performance did not improve but responses were significantly faster. Cathodal stimulation had no effect. Results are explained in the framework of GY's reorganized cortical connexions and oscillatory patterns known to be involved in awareness in GY. The apparent presence of phenomenal visual percepts in earlier studies is shown to be a semantic confusion about what he means when he says that he sees in his blind field.", "pages": "469-75"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of the cortico-spinal tract in image-guided mini-invasive neurosurgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "23228862", "authors": ["Cordella, R", "Acerbi, F", "Broggi, M", "Vailati, D", "Nazzi, V", "Schiariti, M", "Tringali, G", "Ferroli, P", "Franzini, A", "Broggi, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To evaluate the role of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in image-guided mini-invasive neurosurgery.", "pages": "469-75"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Effect of repetitive afferent electrical stimulation of the lower limb on corticomotor excitability and implications for rehabilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "23228660", "authors": ["L\u00e9onard, G", "Mercier, C", "Tremblay, LE"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "Twenty-one patients were operated under general anaesthesia with the aid of multimodal intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring to remove supratentorials tumors closely related to the cortico-spinal tract.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of high-frequency afferent electrical stimulation of the anterior thigh area on the corticomotor excitability of lower limb muscles. Twenty-two healthy subjects (mean age 23 \u00b1 7 years) participated in the study. Electrical stimulation was applied for 60 minutes on the anterior thigh area (frequency 100 Hz, pulse duration 60 \u03bcs, intensity below motor threshold). Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) of the rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were recorded before, and after, the electrical stimulation paradigm with a Magstim 200 stimulator. Analyses revealed a significant modulation in MEP amplitude for the RF but not for the BF muscle. Specifically, there was a significant reduction in MEP amplitude for the RF muscle immediately, 15 minutes and 30 minutes after the end of electrical stimulation when compared with baseline. Our results indicate that a 60-minute high-frequency electrical stimulation protocol applied on the anterior thigh area decreases the corticomotor excitability of the RF muscle. Although the exact duration remains unknown, the pattern of modulation observed indicates that the inhibitory effect lasts for more than 30 minutes after the end of stimulation, giving enough time for clinicians to work on the desired motor task during rehabilitation.", "pages": "469-75"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Neuromodulation in psychiatric disorders.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9553843", "authors": ["Temel, Y", "Hescham, SA", "Jahanshahi, A", "Janssen, ML", "Tan, SK", "van Overbeeke, JJ", "Ackermans, L", "Oosterloo, M", "Duits, A", "Leentjens, AF", "Lim, L"], "year": "2012", "journal": "International review of neurobiology", "abstract": "To evaluate the efficiency of combined central and local physiotherapeutic procedures in correcting neuroendocrine and menstrual disorders in pubertal girls (PG) with obesity.", "pages": "469-75"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Neurophysiology of cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9654332", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "International review of neurobiology", "abstract": "Eighty-seven PGs, including 67 with different levels of obesity and 20 healthy non-obese girls, were examined.
