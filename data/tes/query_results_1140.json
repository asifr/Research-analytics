However, the neurobiological effects of this tool are not sufficiently explained so far, previous research reported that rTMS can change dopamine release, there have been few studies to examine a possible effect of rTMS on amino acid neurotransmitter. This study aimed to determine the effects of chronic rTMS on glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in the rat brain. Sprague-Dawley rat was subject to 500 pulses of 0.5 Hz rTMS for 15 days, or sham stimulation. After last stimulation, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid content were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that the content of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid increased significantly in hippocampus and striatum after chronic rTMS, but reduced significantly in the hypothalamus. These results indicate that chronic rTMS has a modulatory effect on the glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid systems. This change in amino acid neurotransmitter may contribute to its beneficial effects.", "pages": "1161-7"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Differential effect of halothane on motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial electric or magnetic stimulation in the monkey.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15788702", "authors": ["Sloan, T", "Rogers, J"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "abstract": "Left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is a critical neural substrate for the resolution of proactive interference (PI) in working memory. We hypothesized that left IFG achieves this by controlling the influence of familiarity- versus recollection-based information about memory probes. Consistent with this idea, we observed evidence for an early (200 msec)-peaking signal corresponding to memory probe familiarity and a late (500 msec)-resolving signal corresponding to full accrual of trial-related contextual (\"recollection-based\") information. Next, we applied brief trains of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) time locked to these mnemonic signals, to left IFG and to a control region. Only early rTMS of left IFG produced a modulation of the false alarm rate for high-PI probes. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was predicted by individual differences in susceptibility to PI. These results suggest that left IFG-based control may bias the influence of familiarity- and recollection-based signals on recognition decisions.", "pages": "1161-7"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Modulation of preparatory volitional motor cortical activity by paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "16135552", "authors": ["Lu, MK", "Bliem, B", "Jung, P", "Arai, N", "Tsai, CH", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "The ability to stop ongoing motor responses in a split-second is a vital element of human cognitive control and flexibility that relies in large part on prefrontal cortex. We used the stop-signal paradigm to elucidate the engagement of primary motor cortex (M1) in inhibiting an ongoing voluntary motor response. The stop-signal paradigm taps the ability to flexibly countermand ongoing voluntary behavior upon presentation of a stop signal. We applied single-pulse TMS to M1 at several intervals following the stop signal to track the time course of excitability of the motor system related to generating and stopping a manual response. Electromyography recorded from the flexor pollicis brevis allowed quantification of the excitability of the corticospinal tract and the involvement of intracortical GABA(B)ergic circuits within M1, indexed respectively by the amplitude of the motor-evoked potential and the duration of the late part of the cortical silent period (SP). The results extend our knowledge of the neural basis of inhibitory control in three ways. First, the results revealed a dynamic interplay between response activation and stopping processes at M1 level during stop-signal inhibition of an ongoing response. Second, increased excitability of inhibitory interneurons that drives SP prolongation was evident as early as 134 msec following the instruction to stop. Third, this pattern was followed by a stop-related reduction of corticospinal excitability implemented around 180 after the stop signal. These findings point to the recruitment of GABA(B)ergic intracortical inhibitory circuits within M1 in stop-signal inhibition and support the notion of stopping as an active act of control.", "pages": "1161-7"}, {"volume": "452", "title": "Evidence that transduction of electromagnetic field is mediated by a force receptor.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16337090", "authors": ["Marino, AA", "Carrubba, S", "Frilot, C", "Chesson, AL"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The cerebellum is a key modulator of motor cortex activity, allowing both the maintenance and fine-tuning of motor cortex discharges.
