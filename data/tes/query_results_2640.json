Possible reasons for this include the multisegmental innervation of these muscles and the long muscle fiber conduction. Stretch reflex activation elicited by contraction of muscles above the lesion is thought to be an unlikely mechanism because of the latency of the response. Although the presence or absence of muscle motor-evoked potentials does not appear to be a sensitive indicator of the level of thoracic spinal cord injury lesion, analysis of muscle motor-evoked potentials reveals abnormal patterns that may assist in defining lesions. Finally, lower threshold above the lesion suggests corticospinal hyperexcitability of this pathway as a result of central plasticity after spinal cord injury.", "pages": "1438-43"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Responses of ankle extensor and flexor motoneurons to transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12091538", "authors": ["Bawa, P", "Chalmers, GR", "Stewart, H", "Eisen, AA"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The functional relevance of brain activity during visuospatial tasks was investigated by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

While visuospatial operations were associated with activation of the intraparietal sulcus region bilaterally, only the group which received rTMS to the right parietal lobe showed an impairment of performance during and immediately after rTMS. This functional parietal asymmetry might indicate a capacity of the right parietal lobe to compensate for a temporary suppression of the left.

However, the neuronal control of muscle activation differs between isometric and dynamic contractions. This study was designed to investigate voluntary activation, motor cortex excitability, and intracortical inhibition during fatiguing concentric and eccentric actions. Eight subjects performed 143 torque motor-controlled, repeated shortening and lengthening actions of the elbow flexor muscles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied three times every 20 cycles. Magnetic evoked motor potentials (MEP), duration of the silent period (SP), and the torque increase due to TMS were analyzed. TMS resulted in a small torque increase in unfatigued actions. With repeated actions, voluntary torque dropped rapidly and the amplitude of the TMS-induced twitches increased, especially during repeated lengthening actions. MEP area of biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles increased during repeated actions to a similar extent during lengthening and shortening fatigue. The duration of biceps and brachioradialis SP did not change with fatigue. Thus, voluntary activation became suboptimal during fatiguing dynamic actions and motor cortex excitability increased without any changes in intracortical inhibition. The apparent dissociation of voluntary activation and motor cortex excitability suggests that the central fatigue observed, especially during lengthening actions, did not result from changes in motor cortex excitability.", "pages": "1438-43"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Post-exercise facilitation and depression of M wave and motor evoked potentials in healthy subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "15121673", "authors": ["Lentz, M", "Nielsen, JF"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The function and course of the cortico-respiratory projections in man are not yet well established. In 30 normal volunteers respiratory muscles were activated by magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and the cervical and thoracic spinal roots with bilateral recordings from the respiratory muscles. Following cortical stimulation contralateral responses were obtained in all subjects during voluntary inspiration showing a mean latency and amplitude of 13.4+/-1.4ms/1.6+/-1.2 mV (stimulation of the left hemisphere) and 13.2+/-1.3ms/2.5+/-2.5 mV (stimulation of the right hemisphere). Ipsilateral responses were obtained in only 18 (right side) and 21 (left side) subjects and had a significantly (p < 0.001) longer mean latency and lower mean amplitude than the contralateral responses. In 31 patients with impairment of the cortico-respiratory projections due to cerebral infarction demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging studies, the responsible lesion topography was analysed. We found that, 1. the voluntary activation of respiratory muscles is mediated predominantly by the contralateral motor cortex, 2. the descending cortico-respiratory projections are located within the pyramidal tract, and 3. the cortico-respiratory projections to the respiratory muscles are frequently affected in patients with hemiparesis due to acute stroke. These findings might explain the increased incidence of pneumonia at the hemiparetic side in patients with cerebral ischemia as shown in previous studies.", "pages": "1438-43"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Combined monitoring of motor and somatosensory evoked potentials in orthopaedic spinal surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "12088705", "authors": ["Pelosi, L", "Lamb, J", "Grevitt, M", "Mehdian, SM", "Webb, JK", "Blumhardt, LD"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The development of imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has allowed non-invasive imaging of the brain, to a greater detail, that in the past was not possible.

It has become increasingly obvious that swallowing is complex and its recovery following stroke even more so. Swallowing is represented in many areas of the hemisphere and is affected in many different ways following stroke. In most, recovery is spontaneous, but in some it is slow or non-existent. Studies using direct and transcranial electrical stimulation and pharmacological agents have shown interesting results in the recovery of swallowing following stroke.", "pages": "1438-43"}]
