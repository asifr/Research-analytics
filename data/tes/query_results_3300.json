TCS over the face-associated motor cortex with 1.3 times the response threshold for relaxed muscles produced bilateral tongue responses with similar latencies and amplitudes for ipsi-(8.3 +/- 1.1 ms, 1.3 +/- 0.7 mV) and contralateral responses (8.5 +/- 1.0 ms, 1.7 +/- 0.8 mV, n = 20, 10 subjects). In individual subjects maximal ipsilateral and contralateral responses were elicited by stimulation over about the same cortex area which lay 2-4 cm lateral and 0-2 cm anterior to the center of the hand motor representation area. Magnetic stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve with 70% of the maximal stimulator output and a circular coil placed over the posterior lateral skull produced a more proximal nerve excitation than electrical stimulation at the mandible, as reflected by the response latencies (3.4 +/- 0.9 ms vs. 2.1 +/- 0.7 ms). The effect of magnetic TNS was independent of the direction of the coil currents. Central motor latencies as calculated by subtracting the response latencies after TNS from the overall latency after TCS were 4.8 +/- 1.2 ms and 5.0 +/- 1.1 ms for ipsi- and contralateral responses, respectively. The findings suggest the existence of a direct and fast conducting connection between motor cortex and brainstem tongue motor nuclei on both sides in man.", "pages": "24-8"}, {"volume": "744", "title": "Evidence for facilitation of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by motor imagery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9030424", "authors": ["Kasai, T", "Kawai, S", "Kawanishi, M", "Yahagi, S"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "This study examined the extent to which motor imagery can facilitate to specific pools of motoneurons. Motor commands induced by motor imagery were subthreshold for muscle activity and were presumably not associated with any change in background afferent activity. To estimate excitability changes of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle motoneuron in spinal and cortical level, electric stimuli for recording H-reflex and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for recording motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were used. During motor imagery of wrist flexion, remarkable increases in the amplitude of the MEP of FCR were observed with no change in the H-reflex. Furthermore, facilitation of antagonist (extensor carpi radialis; ECR) was also observed. Therefore, it is concluded that internal motor command can activate precisely cortical excitability with no change in spinal level without recourse to afferent feedback.", "pages": "24-8"}, {"volume": "744", "title": "Delay in simple reaction time after focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human brain occurs at the final motor output stage.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9030410", "authors": ["Ziemann, U", "Tergau, F", "Netz, J", "H\u00f6mberg, V"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "It is known that the execution of the motor response in a simple reaction time (RT) task can be delayed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This paper is aimed at determining the site of action where the delay in RT occurs. A delay in RT was obtained only at those TMS sites over the motor cortex contralateral to the responding hand, which produced also a muscle twitch in the responding hand. The delay in RT covaried with the TMS intensity and increased the closer the time of TMS approached the expected time of reaction onset. Visual and auditory go-signals yielded similar delays in RT, but only when TMS was applied about 40 ms later for the visual go-signal, corresponding to the modality specific difference in RT control values. TMS of the supplementary motor area (SMA) immediately prior to the expected time of reaction onset produced no delay in RT. Spinal excitability as tested by F waves showed a pre-movement facilitation in the control trials which continued seemingly undisturbed during the period of RT delay after TMS. It can be concluded that the delay in RT is not due to SMA stimulation or spinal inhibition but depends on effective stimulation of neural elements in the motor cortex which are active very late in the process of movement release from the final motor output stage.", "pages": "24-8"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex: Clinical applications.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18638915", "authors": ["Kiers, L"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation provides the clinical neurophysiologist with a method to examine alterations in the function of central motor pathways in diseases affecting the motor system.

Multi-modal integration may perhaps give more powerful information than each modality alone, especially when one of the methods is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with its ability to non-invasively activate the brain.

Thus, the site of facial nerve activation with TMS is proximal to or within the site of the lesion in Bell's palsy. To evaluate the prognostic capability of TMS in unilateral Bell's palsy we examined 137 patients with this method, and compared the results with electroneuronography (ENoG). Within 0-4 days from the onset of palsy, the patients with elicitable TMS responses recovered better than those in whom TMS responses were not elicitable. If TMS was performed 5-9 days or 10-28 days after the onset of palsy, it did not provide any prognostic information. Based on amplitude side-to-side differences, ENoG did not contribute prognostic information during the first 9 days from the onset of palsy. Later on, 10-28 days after the onset of palsy, ENoG showed an increased capability to discriminate the patients with poor prognosis. Thus, elicitable facial motor response with TMS predicts good prognosis of Bell's palsy at an early stage whereas poor response with ENoG predicts less favorable prognosis at a later stage.", "pages": "24-8"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "[Segmental conduction times in motor pathways for the soleus muscle--methodology and normal values].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9235520", "authors": ["Wochnik-Dyjas, D", "G\u0142azowski, C", "Niewiadomska, M"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska", "abstract": "The study performed in 30 normal subjects (24F, 6M) with age range 18-55 years and height range 154-188 cm.

Routine neurophysiological investigation (utilizing electrical stimulation and the blink reflex) does not allow the direct assessment of the site of a lesion. In the present study transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied in order to evaluate the usefulness of this method for prognosis. Twenty-three patients with postoperative facial pareses (after removals of an acoustic neuroma in 12 patients and parotid tumors in 11) were investigated. Ipsilateral short-latency and contralateral long-latency responses (after cortex stimulation) were elicited. At the first examination (11.7 +/- 9 days after onset of the palsy) the components of the blink reflex were absent in all cases. Responses to electrical stimulation were abnormal in 80%. Ipsilateral short-latency responses after TMS could be obtained in 7 patients. Pathological long-latency TMS responses were elicited in 17 patients. Follow-up investigations up to 2 years revealed no prognostic aspects from peripheral electrical stimulation, the blink reflex and the short-latency TMS response. The absence or extent of delay in long-latency responses at first examination was strongly correlated with final clinical outcomes. As improvements of the responses preceded clinical regressions of the paresis, TMS proved to be an important neurophysiological method for an early prognosis of recovery after perioperative lesions of the facial nerve.", "pages": "24-8"}]
