The next steps to be carried out encompass better histological safety data. In order to preclude the possibility of neuronal damage, extending tDCS duration should be limited until more direct safety criteria are available than those derived from Agnew and McCreery (1987) (cf. Nitsche et al, this volume). Safe stimulation protocols have to be developed which allow an extension of the duration of after-effects towards a somewhat permanent state, supposing a beneficial effect can be found in neurological diseases or in neurorehabilitation.", "pages": "249-54"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Disruption of the neural correlates of working memory using high- and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: a negative study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677394", "authors": ["Feredoes, EA", "Sachdev, PS", "Wen, W"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Animal studies have shown that descending pathways from the frontal cortex modulate dopamine (DA) release in the striatum. This modulation is thought to be relevant to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. In human, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can result in functional changes in the cortex. The present study intended to clarify the effects of acute rTMS treatment using various stimulation intensities on the extracellular DA concentrations in the rat dorsolateral striatum. The frontal brain of each rat received acute rTMS treatment, which consisted of 500 stimuli from 20 trains in a day. Each train was applied at 25 Hz for 1 s with 1-min intervals between trains. The neurochemical effects of acute rTMS treatment were investigated by determining the extracellular concentrations of DA in the rat dorsolateral striatum using in vivo microdialysis. Acute rTMS treatment of the frontal brain using the stimulation intensity of almost 110% motor threshold (MT) markedly and continuously increased the extracellular DA concentrations in the rat dorsolateral striatum. The present study demonstrates that acute rTMS treatment of the frontal brain affects the DAergic neuronal system in the rat dorsolateral striatum, and may have therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "249-54"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Motor control in mirror movements: studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "14677392", "authors": ["Cincotta, M", "Borgheresi, A", "Ragazzoni, A", "Vanni, P", "Balestrieri, F", "Benvenuti, F", "Zaccara, G", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The role of the anterior cingulate in the counting Stroop task was examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

It is unknown whether minor functional changes of central nervous system are also present in less severe forms of FSHD. To investigate this, we examined the excitability of neuronal networks of the motor cortex with a range of transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms in 20 FSHD patients with heterogeneous clinical severity and compared the data with that from 20 age-matched healthy individuals and from 6 age-matched patients with other muscle diseases. There was significantly less intracortical inhibition in FSHD patients (mean responses +/- SD reduced to 58.1+/-43.5% of the test size) than in controls (mean responses +/- SD reduced to 29.3+/-13.5% of the test size; P=0.025) and in patients with other muscle diseases (mean responses +/-SD, reduced to 30.6+/-11.7% of the test size; P=0.046).

Some theories suggest that this process engages resources overlapping with those required for action control, but experimental support for these ideas is still required. Here, we investigated whether the human frontal eye field (FEF), an area known to control eye movements, is involved in visual awareness. Volunteers participated in a backward masking task in which they were able to detect a target in a small proportion of trials. We observed that a single pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the FEF shortly before the target's onset facilitated visual sensitivity; subjects were able to detect an otherwise subliminal object. These results show that modulating the neuronal activity of the FEF can enhance visual detection, thereby yielding new insights into the neural basis of visual awareness.", "pages": "249-54"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Failure of Digitimer's D-185 transcranial stimulator to deliver declared stimulus parameters.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "14652109", "authors": ["Journ\u00e9e, HL", "Shils, J", "Bueno de Camargo, A", "Novak, K", "Deletis, V"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "249-54"}]
