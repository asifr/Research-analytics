Only one study was judged as being at low risk of bias. Studies of rTMS demonstrated significant heterogeneity. Pre-specified subgroup analyses suggest that low-frequency stimulation is ineffective. A short-term effect on pain of active high-frequency stimulation of the motor cortex in single-dose studies was suggested (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to -0.54, P < 0.00001). This equates to a 15% (95% CI 10% to 20%) reduction in pain which does not clearly exceed the pre-established criteria for a minimally clinically important difference (> 15%). For CES (four studies, 133 participants) no statistically significant difference was found between active stimulation and sham. Analysis of tDCS studies (five studies, 83 people) demonstrated significant heterogeneity and did not find a significant difference between active and sham stimulation. Pre-specified subgroup analysis of tDCS applied to the motor cortex suggested superiority of active stimulation over sham (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.08).

However, responses to cTBS are highly variable and may depend on the activity of the cortex at the time of stimulation. We investigated whether power in different electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands predicted the response to subsequent cTBS, and conversely whether cTBS had after-effects on the EEG. cTBS may utilize similar mechanisms of plasticity to motor learning; thus, we conducted a parallel set of experiments to test whether ongoing electroencephalography could predict performance of a visuomotor training task, and whether training itself had effects on the EEG. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) provided an index of cortical excitability pre- and post-intervention. The EEG was recorded over the motor cortex pre- and post-intervention, and power spectra were computed. cTBS reduced MEP amplitudes; however, baseline power in the delta, theta, alpha or beta frequencies did not predict responses to cTBS or learning of the visuomotor training task. cTBS had no effect on delta, theta, alpha or beta power. In contrast, there was an increase in alpha power following visuomotor training that was positively correlated with changes in MEP amplitude post-training. The results suggest that the EEG is not a useful state-marker for predicting responses to plasticity-inducing paradigms. The correlation between alpha power and changes in corticospinal excitability following visuomotor training requires further investigation, but may be related to disengagement of the somatosensory system important for motor memory consolidation.", "pages": "309-26"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Mechanisms of aphasia recovery after stroke and the role of noninvasive brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "21462815", "authors": ["Hamilton, RH", "Chrysikou, EG", "Coslett, B"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain and language", "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be proficiently used to modulate attentional and cognitive functions. For instance, in the language domain there is evidence that tDCS can fasten picture naming in both healthy individuals and aphasic patients, or improve grammar learning. In this study, we investigated whether tDCS can be used to increase healthy subjects' performance in phonemic and semantic fluency tasks, that are typically used in clinical assessment of language. Ten healthy individuals performed a semantic and a phonemic fluency task following anodal tDCS applied over Broca's region. Each participant underwent a real and a sham tDCS session. Participants were found to produce more words following real anodal tDCS both in the phonemic and in the semantic fluency. Control experiments ascertained that this finding did not depend upon unspecific effects of tDCS over levels of general arousal or attention or upon participants' expectations. These data confirm the efficacy of tDCS in transiently improving language functions by showing that anodal stimulation of Broca's region can enhance verbal fluency.

A nonlinear, inverted U-shaped dose-response curve of its effects on cognition has been observed in animal studies. The basis for this nonlinear effect might be a similar effect of dopamine on neuroplasticity. Whereas it has been shown that dopamine affects paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced plasticity, which might reflect learning-related processes to a larger degree than other noninvasive plasticity induction protocols in the human motor cortex in principle, its dose-dependency has not been explored previously. We studied the effect of different dosages of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA on motor cortex plasticity induced by facilitatory and inhibitory PAS of the motor cortex in 12 healthy humans. They received 25, 100, or 200 mg of L-DOPA or placebo medication combined with either excitability-enhancing or -diminishing PAS. Cortical excitability level was monitored before and for up to 2 d after plasticity induction by assessment of transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potentials. Low-dose L-DOPA abolished the aftereffects of PAS and medium-dose L-DOPA prolonged facilitatory plasticity. High-dose L-DOPA reversed the excitability enhancement accomplished by facilitatory PAS to diminution. Thus, the results show a clear nonlinear effect of L-DOPA dosage on associative plasticity, different from that on nonfocal plasticity. This might help to explain dopaminergic effect on cognition and could be relevant for understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases accompanied by alterations of the dopaminergic system.", "pages": "309-26"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials in very young children.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20714075", "authors": ["Fulkerson, DH", "Satyan, KB", "Wilder, LM", "Riviello, JJ", "Stayer, SA", "Whitehead, WE", "Curry, DJ", "Dauser, RC", "Luerssen, TG", "Jea, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.
