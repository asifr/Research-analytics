The amount of this associated activity is depressed in a fatigued muscle, even after correction for fatigue-related changes in maximal force. In the present experiments, we aimed to compare fatigue-related changes in associated activity vs. parameters that are used as markers for changes in central nervous system (CNS) excitability. Subjects performed brief maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) with the index finger in abduction direction before and after fatiguing protocols. We followed changes in MVCs, associated activity, motor-evoked potentials (MEP; transcranial magnetic stimulation), maximal compound muscle potentials (M waves), and superimposed twitches (double pulse) for 20 min after the fatiguing protocols. During the fatiguing protocols, associated activity increased in contralateral muscles, whereas afterwards the associated force was reduced in the fatigued muscle. This force reduction was significantly larger than the decline in MVC. However, associated activity (force and electromyography) remained depressed for only 5-10 min, whereas the MVCs stayed depressed for over 20 min. These decreases were accompanied by a reduction in MEP, MVC electromyography activity, and voluntary activation in the fatigued muscle. According to these latter markers, the decrease in CNS motor excitability lasted much longer than the depression in associated activity. Differential effects of fatigue on (associated) submaximal vs. maximal contractions might contribute to these differences in postfatigue behavior. However, we cannot exclude differences in processes that are specific to either voluntary or to associated contractions.", "pages": "70-82"}, {"volume": "437", "title": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex impairs perceptual processing of tactile temporal discrimination.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18450377", "authors": ["Hannula, H", "Neuvonen, T", "Savolainen, P", "Tukiainen, T", "Salonen, O", "Carlson, S", "Pertovaara, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with biphasic pulses applied approximately over the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) suppresses performance in vibrotactile temporal discrimination tasks; these previous results, however, do not allow separating perceptual influence from memory or decision-making. Moreover, earlier studies using external landmarks for directing biphasic TMS pulses to the cortex do not reveal whether the changes in vibrotactile task performance were due to action on S1 or an adjacent area. In the present study, we determined whether the S1 area representing a cutaneous test site is critical for perceptual processing of tactile temporal discrimination. Electrical test pulses were applied to the thenar skin of the hand and the subjects attempted to discriminate single from twin pulses. During discrimination task, monophasic TMS pulses or sham TMS pulses were directed anatomically accurately to the S1 area representing the thenar using magnetic resonance image-guided navigation. The subject's capacity to temporal discrimination was impaired with a decrease in the delay between the TMS pulse and the cutaneous test pulse from 50 to 0 ms. The result indicates that S1 area representing a cutaneous test site is involved in perceptual processing of tactile temporal discrimination.", "pages": "70-82"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Transcranial motor-evoked potentials combined with response recording through compound muscle action potential as the sole modality of spinal cord monitoring in spinal deformity surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "18449044", "authors": ["Hsu, B", "Cree, AK", "Lagopoulos, J", "Cummine, JL"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "This study is a prospective review of all spinal cord monitoring procedures in our unit from 1999 to 2004 in patients undergoing spinal deformity correction surgery.", "pages": "70-82"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "A local signature of LTP- and LTD-like plasticity in human NREM sleep.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "18978598", "authors": ["Bergmann, TO", "M\u00f6lle, M", "Marshall, L", "Kaya-Yildiz, L", "Born, J", "Roman Siebner, H"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "To report the sensitivity and specificity of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) monitoring as the sole modality in spinal deformity correction surgery.", "pages": "70-82"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Transcranial current stimulation focality using disc and ring electrode configurations: FEM analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18445215", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Elwassif, M", "Battaglia, F", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "Combined spinal cord monitoring with somatosensory-evoked potentials and MEP has been widely used.

Neurological surgery", "abstract": "Paired associative stimulation (PAS) repeatedly pairs electrical nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor hand area (M1(HAND)). Depending on the interstimulus interval, PAS can induce a long-term potentiation (LTP)-like facilitation or long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of cortical excitability. In three experimental sessions, 12 awake men received PAS of the right median nerve and left M1(HAND) in the evening before sleep. To optimize the timing of paired stimulation in M1(HAND), the interstimulus interval of PAS was adjusted to the individual N20-latency of the somatosensory evoked potential to induce LTP-like effects (PAS(N20+2ms)), LTD-like effects (PAS(N20-5ms)), or no timing-dependent after-effects (PAS(control)). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) showed high interindividual variations in the conditioning effects of PAS(N20+2ms) and PAS(N20-5ms) on cortical excitability. However, PAS(control) allowed us to adjust for any unspecific stimulation effects and the MEP increase after PAS(N20+2ms) differed significantly from the MEP decrease after PAS(N20-5ms). PAS(N20+2ms) and PAS(N20-5ms) also had a differential effect on regional expression of slow waves and slow spindle activity during the first hour of subsequent non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. At the electrode sites overlying the conditioned M1(HAND) and the adjacent premotor cortex, local expression of slow spindle activity was significantly correlated with interindividual differences in the efficacy of PAS(N20+2ms) and PAS(N20-5ms) to potentiate or suppress cortical excitability. This correlation indicates that PAS shapes the local regulation of slow sleep spindles during subsequent NREM sleep.", "pages": "70-82"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Comparative assessment of best conventional with best theta burst repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols on human motor cortex excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "18411796", "authors": ["Zafar, N", "Paulus, W", "Sommer, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We calculated the electric fields induced in the brain during transcranial current stimulation (TCS) using a finite-element concentric spheres human head model. A range of disc electrode configurations were simulated: (1) distant-bipolar; (2) adjacent-bipolar; (3) tripolar; and three ring designs, (4) belt, (5) concentric ring, and (6) double concentric ring. We compared the focality of each configuration targeting cortical structures oriented normal to the surface ('surface-radial' and 'cross-section radial'), cortical structures oriented along the brain surface ('surface-tangential' and 'cross-section tangential') and non-oriented cortical surface structures ('surface-magnitude' and 'cross-section magnitude'). For surface-radial fields, we further considered the 'polarity' of modulation (e.g. superficial cortical neuron soma hyper/depolarizing). The distant-bipolar configuration, which is comparable with commonly used TCS protocols, resulted in diffuse (un-focal) modulation with bi-directional radial modulation under each electrode and tangential modulation between electrodes. Increasing the proximity of the two electrodes (adjacent-bipolar electrode configuration) increased focality, at the cost of more surface current. At similar electrode distances, the tripolar-electrodes configuration produced comparable peak focality, but reduced radial bi-directionality. The concentric-ring configuration resulted in the highest spatial focality and uni-directional radial modulation, at the expense of increased total surface current. Changing ring dimensions, or use of two concentric rings, allow titration of this balance. The concentric-ring design may thus provide an optimized configuration for targeted modulation of superficial cortical neurons.", "pages": "70-82"}]
