When TMS is delivered during a voluntary contraction, the MEP is followed by a period of silence called silent period (SP). These MEP parameters are in general recordable by electromyography (EMG). Mechanomyography (MMG) on the other hand is the mechanical counterpart of EMG. Thus, this study has been conducted to observe whether the MEP parameters from MMG signals showed similar trait of EMG recordings. Five normal healthy male subjects were included in this study. The subjects were required to perform right biceps brachii muscles contraction at diverse graded of load level at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 100% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). MEPs by single pulse TMS on left hemisphere were obtained from both EMG electrode and MMG accelerometer at rest and at different levels of predetermined load level. MEP amplitude and area obtained both from EMG and MMG record were increased with the increase of muscle contraction with a maximum of 60% MVC. With increasing the level of contraction there was a shortening of onset latency and decreasing in the length of silent period in both EMG and MMG signals. We also recorded the EMG- and MMG-MEP from the right extensor carpi radialis muscle during transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in order to observe neural changes in sensory stimulation from both EMG and MMG responses. The EMG-MEP was not visible in electrical artifact whereas it was obvious in MMG responses. In accordance with other study, this study showed that the voluntary contraction of biceps brachii muscle influenced the MEP parameter which are moreover obtainable by MMG even in electrical noise may provide insight for future study.", "pages": "649-52"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation for tinnitus: influence of tinnitus duration on stimulation parameter choice and maximal tinnitus suppression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16015156", "authors": ["De Ridder, D", "Verstraeten, E", "Van der Kelen, K", "De Mulder, G", "Sunaert, S", "Verlooy, J", "Van de Heyning, P", "Moller, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology", "abstract": "The neurophysiological techniques currently available to evaluate anorectal disorders include concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the external anal sphincter, anal nerve terminal motor latency (TML) measurement in response to transrectal electrical stimulation or sacral magnetic stimulation, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the anal sphincter to transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation, cortical recording of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to anal nerve stimulation, quantification of electrical or thermal sensory thresholds (QSTs) within the anal canal, sacral anal reflex (SAR) latency measurement in response to pudendal nerve or perianal stimulation, and perianal recording of sympathetic skin responses (SSRs). In most cases, a comprehensive approach using several tests is helpful for diagnosis: needle EMG signs of sphincter denervation or prolonged TML give evidence for anal motor nerve lesion; SEP/QST or SSR abnormalities can suggest sensory or autonomic neuropathy; and in the absence of peripheral nerve disorder, MEPs, SEPs, SSRs, and SARs can assist in demonstrating and localizing spinal or supraspinal disease.
