Nine patients participated in 1 week of conventional physiotherapy. In the subsequent week conventional physiotherapy was combined with forced-use therapy. Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to determine the motor output areas of the abductor pollicis brevis muscles prior to the treatment and after the first and after the second week. Motor performance was evaluated using the Nine Hole Peg Test, the Frenchay Arm Test and vigorometry to measure the grip strength. Before treatment the cortical representation area of the paretic hand muscle was significantly smaller than the contralateral side. This difference persisted after the first week of physiotherapy. In contrast, the motor output map in the affected hemisphere was significantly enlarged after forced-use therapy. This increase in motor cortex excitability was accompanied by a significant improvement in dexterity. Across the two treatment weeks the centres of the motor output maps shifted significantly stronger in the affected hemisphere than in unaffected hemisphere, suggesting the recruitment of adjacent brain areas. We conclude that the combination of forced-use therapy and conventional physiotherapy enhances motor cortex excitability and improves motor performance compared to a preceding conventional physiotherapy alone. Due to the small number of patients and the lack of a control group, these results are preliminary observations and require replication in a larger sample.", "pages": "1035-40"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Modulation of practice-dependent plasticity in human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 6", "pmid": "11353733", "authors": ["Ziemann, U", "Muellbacher, W", "Hallett, M", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "1.

Although dysphoria was successfully induced by unsolvable anagrams, TMS on either of the two frontal locations did not influence mood. This lack of effect may be due to the stimulation characteristics employed here (low TMS intensity, and low frequency).

To investigate the relationship between somatosensory and motor reorganization and phantom limb pain, we used focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex and neuroelectric source imaging of the somatosensory cortex (SI) in patients with and without phantom limb pain. For transcranial magnetic stimulation, recordings were made bilaterally from the biceps brachii, zygomaticus, and depressor labii inferioris muscles. Neuroelectric source imaging of the EEG was obtained after somatosensory stimulation of the skin overlying face and hand. Patients with phantom limb pain had larger motor-evoked potentials from the biceps brachii, and the map of outputs was larger for muscles on the amputated side compared with the intact side. The optimal scalp positions for stimulation of the zygomaticus and depressor labii inferioris muscles were displaced significantly more medially (toward the missing hand representation) in patients with phantom limb pain only. Neuroelectric source imaging revealed a similar medial displacement of the dipole center for face stimulation in patients with phantom limb pain. There was a high correlation between the magnitude of the shift of the cortical representation of the mouth into the hand area in motor and somatosensory cortex and phantom limb pain.

Two rTMS trains were delivered over the left frontal area, with 30 pulses in each train. ERPs were recorded at 14 electrode sites on the scalp using a typical oddball protocol before and after rTMS. Tone stimuli (20% target and 80% standard) were delivered through earphones. Latency and amplitude of N100, P200, N200 and P300 were measured and compared during the study. To observe information flow between two electrode sites, directed coherence (DCOH) was calculated on the ERPs. Our results show that the effect of rTMS differs in the various ERPs components (P < 0.001). The latency of P300 significantly increased after stimulation, and the increase was more obvious in the frontal (18.6 ms) and central (15.8 ms) areas. The latency of P200 decreased in all areas. The amplitude of component N100 in the frontal and central areas decreased after rTMS. DCOH from the central area to the temporal area and DCOH from the parietal area to the temporal area were significantly higher than the DCOH between other areas (P < 0.01), and these properties were not affected by rTMS (P > 0.05). Information flow was driven from the frontal area to the parietal area after stimulation. Our results suggest that rTMS can suppress cognitive activities, showing an inhibitory effect on neurophysiological processes in the human brain. Since the temporal area is located at the terminus of the propagation pathways, it plays important roles in processing information in cognitive activities.", "pages": "1035-40"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Corticospinal responses to motor training revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11337823", "authors": ["Carroll, TJ", "Riek, S", "Carson, RG"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Exercise and sport sciences reviews", "abstract": "Motor practice may lead to expansion of trained representations in the motor cortex, but it is unknown whether this practice-dependent plasticity can be purposefully enhanced or depressed. Evidence, mainly based on animal experiments, indicates that the activity of GABA-related cortical inhibition is important in controlling the extent to which plasticity may occur. We tested the role of GABA in modulating practice-dependent plasticity in the human motor cortex. A decrease in GABA-related cortical inhibition was achieved by ischaemic nerve block (INB) in the hand by deafferentation/deefferentation and an increase was achieved by administration of the GABA(A) receptor agonist lorazepam. In Experiment 1, healthy subjects performed motor practice (MP), consisting of repeated ballistic contractions of the biceps muscle in the absence (MP alone) or presence of INB (MP+INB). Changes in the biceps motor cortex representation were assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). MP+INB resulted in a dramatic increase in the size of the motor evoked potential (MEP) and in paired-pulse excitability compared with mild or no changes in the MP-alone and INB-alone conditions. In Experiment 2, this dramatic increase in biceps representation induced by MP+INB was replicated when subjects were pretreated with placebo, but this increase was prevented or even switched to a decrease when subjects were pretreated with lorazepam. These findings indicate that a decrease in GABA-related inhibition facilitates practice-dependent plasticity in the human motor cortex, whereas an increase depresses it. In Experiment 3, practice-dependent plasticity (assessed by TMS, as in the first two experiments) was also tested at the behavioural level. The dramatic increase in biceps MEP size induced by MP+INB was paralleled by an increase in peak acceleration of the fastest elbow flexion movements. Similarly, the lack of change in MEP size in the MP-alone condition was paralleled by a lack of change in peak acceleration. We propose that changes in GABA activity may be instrumented to modulate plasticity purposefully; for instance, to enhance plastic change and recovery of function after a lesion in neurological patients.", "pages": "1035-40"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "The triple stimulation technique to study central motor conduction to the lower limbs.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "11336912", "authors": ["B\u00fchler, R", "Magistris, MR", "Truffert, A", "Hess, CW", "R\u00f6sler, KM"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The alien hand sign (AHS) is often encountered in patients with corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD), revealing a unilateral dysfunction of the motor system of unknown pathophysiology.

Cortical maps were obtained from the responses to magnetic stimuli applied with a figure of eight coil at an intensity of 110% above motor threshold. For comparison, the same study was carried out in 10 normal volunteers, eight patients with Parkinson's disease and eight patients with Alzheimer's disease. AHS patients had a larger extension of the cortical map to stimulation of the hemisphere contralateral to the AHS in comparison with the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, in six patients, focal stimulation of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the AHS gave rise to ipsilateral responses, delayed by a mean of 7.7 +/- 2.2 ms with respect to those recorded in the same muscle to contralateral stimulation. None of the other patients or control subjects had ipsilateral responses. Our results indicate an enhanced excitability, or reduced inhibition, of the motor area of the hemisphere contralateral to the AHS. The delay of the ipsilateral responses is compatible with a disinhibited transcallosal input.", "pages": "1035-40"}]
