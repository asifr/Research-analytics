Each subject, in four separate sessions, received intravenous bolus doses of propofol 2 mg.kg-1, etomidate 0.3 mg.kg-1, midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1, and fentanyl 3 micrograms.kg-1. Electrical tc-MERs (tce-MERs) were elicited with anodal stimuli of 500-700 V. Magnetic tc-MERs (tcmag-MERs) were elicited using a Cadwell MES-10 magnetic stimulator at maximum output. Compound muscle action potentials were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle. Duplicate tce-MERs and tcmag-MERs were recorded before and up to 30 min after drug injection. Reproducible baseline tce-MERs (amplitude 4.7 +/- 0.43 (SEM) mV, latency 29.4 +/- 0.35 ms) and tcmag-MERs (amplitude 3.7 +/- 0.43 mV, latency 31.1 +/- 0.39 ms) were obtained in all subjects. Pronounced depression of tce-MER amplitude to 2% of baseline values (P less than 0.01) was observed 2 min after injection of propofol. Thirty minutes after injection of propofol, amplitude depression to 44% of baseline (P less than 0.05) was still present, despite an apparent lack of sedation. Midazolam caused significant (P less than 0.01) amplitude depression, e.g., tcmag-MER to 16% of baseline values 5 min after injection. Significant depression persisted throughout the 30-min study period. Fentanyl did not cause any statistically significant amplitude changes in this small population. Etomidate caused significant but transient depression of tc-MER amplitude. However, there was considerable intersubject variability. Latency did not change significantly after any drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "502-9"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatic sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in the management of cervical spondylitic myelopathy (CSM)].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1499416", "authors": ["Tang, X"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Zhonghua shen jing jing shen ke za zhi = Chinese journal of neurology and psychiatry", "abstract": "Fourteen CSM patients with clinical findings of myelopathy had their diagnoses proved with MRI imaging and at operation.

In 2 patients with prolongation of CMCT, normal SEPs were found in the same arm while 1 patient showed directly a reversal of the results. The short-term follow-up study in 10 patients showed normalization of the prolonged CMCT in one and reappearance of motor action potentials with C7 stimulation in another.

A magnetic coil was placed over the parieto-occipital skull of the subjects for stimulation, and the facial nerve was electrically stimulated in its intracranial and peripheral courses. Then an electromyogram was recorded from the nasalis muscle of the face on the stimulated side. In 9 healthy volunteers, 18 facial nerves received magnetic and electric stimuli in the peripheral region, and the actual site of stimulation was estimated from the conduction velocity of the nerve. The conduction velocity was 56.6 +/- 4.8 m/s, and the latency between CMAPs for electric at the magnetic stimuli to the posterior tragus was 1.23 +/- 0.21 ms. Therefore, the position stimulated by magnetic coil was estimated to be 70.0 +/- 11.4 mm central to the posterior tragus, i.e., near the root exit zone. In two patients undergoing surgery in the cerebellopontine angle, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation of the intracranial facial nerve were compared intraoperatively. The CMAP produced by transcranial magnetic stimulation coincided closely with that produced by direct electrical stimulation of the root exit zone. Thus, the facial nerve was stimulated at the root exit zone, and this method could be expected to be useful for evaluation of disorders of the intracranial facial nerve.", "pages": "502-9"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Afferent conditioning of motor evoked potentials following transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1373371", "authors": ["Kasai, T", "Hayes, KC", "Wolfe, DL", "Allatt, RD"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The present study determined the effects of percutaneous electrical stimulation of the plantar surface on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) of normal subjects following transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex. The conditioning stimulation consisted of a 20 msec train of electrical pulses (500 Hz; 0.1 msec rectangular) delivered to the medial border of the sole of the foot at an intensity just subthreshold for evoking a flexion reflex. The conditioning (C) stimulation preceded the test (T) cortical stimulation by intervals of 20-130 msec. Magnetic stimulation of motor cortex (Cadwell MES-10) was delivered through a 9.5 cm focal point coil positioned tangential to the scalp and located with the rim over vertex. Five healthy adults served as subjects and each was investigated on at least 2 occasions. At C-T intervals 20-50 msec there was a mild inhibition of MEPs in both TA and SOL. This was followed by marked facilitation (greater than 300%) of MEPs at C-T intervals 50-85 msec in both TA and SOL in all subjects. At longer C-T intervals greater than 110 msec, there was an inhibition of MEPs in TA but not in SOL. Based on the time course of these 3 phases of MEP amplitude modulation, and different stimulation thresholds for each phase, it appears that separate neurophysiological processes underlie each phase of MEP modulation. These observations also suggest that percutaneous electrical stimulation may be useful as a means of enhancing low amplitude or subliminal MEPs in normal subjects or patients with myelopathy.", "pages": "502-9"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Reinforcement of subliminal flexion reflexes by transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex in subjects with spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1373362", "authors": ["Hayes, KC", "Allatt, RD", "Wolfe, DL", "Kasai, T", "Hsieh, J"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "A 20 msec train (500 Hz; 0.1-0.2 msec duration) of percutaneous electrical stimulation (ES) applied to the plantar surface was used to condition muscle responses evoked in tibialis anterior (TA) by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in 8 subjects with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The intensity of conditioning ES was adjusted to just subthreshold for evoking flexion reflexes in TA and was delivered at conditioning-test (C-T) intervals of 15-60 msec prior to cortical stimulation. Four subjects with clinically complete SCI revealed no muscle response to cortical stimulation or following combined subliminal percutaneous ES and cortical stimulation. Four subjects (3 clinically incomplete and 1 complete injury) demonstrated muscle responses with a latency of 70-80 msec time-locked to the percutaneous ES when the conditioning subliminal stimulation was delivered at C-T: 15-40 msec. These responses, resembling suprathreshold flexion reflexes, reflect the convergence of excitatory afferent and cortical inputs and provide evidence of preserved corticospinal innervation to the L4-5 segmental motoneuron or interneuron pools. In 3 of the subjects this preserved corticospinal influence was evident despite absence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) following cortical stimulation. The effect of the combined electrical and cortical stimulation in yielding suprathreshold flexion reflexes, instead of the facilitated MEPs seen in control subjects, appears to be related to slowed central conduction, prolonged temporal dispersion of the motoneuron facilitation following cortical stimulation and segmental reflex changes associated with disrupted modulation of interneuronal pathways. The results show this conditioning paradigm to be useful in revealing preserved corticospinal innervation in some SCI subjects with absent MEPs.", "pages": "502-9"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Cortically evoked motor responses in patients with Xp22.3-linked Kallmann's syndrome and in female gene carriers.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "1637137", "authors": ["Danek, A", "Heye, B", "Schroedter, R"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Patients with Kallmann's syndrome show hypothalamic hypogonadism, hyposmia, and congenital mirror movements.

In all 3 affected brothers, bilateral responses could be evoked almost simultaneously in their thenar muscles (slight latency differences were statistically insignificant). In contrast, the mother and the maternal aunt showed only unilateral, normal thenar responses, even with maximum tolerable stimulator output and high signal amplification. Correspondingly, mirror movements were present in the patients, but not in the gene carriers. Bilaterality of cortically evoked hand muscle responses and mirror movements, therefore, behaved as X-chromosomal recessive traits. A likely cause might be a disorder of neuronal outgrowth in the motor system, particularly of inhibitory callosal fibers.

The clinical application of extratemporal stimulation distal to the stylomastoid foramen is limited in these cases by the more proximal site of the lesion. Transcranial magnetic coil stimulation (MCS) is a noninvasive means by which the facial nerve is stimulated at the level of the motor cortex or the brain stem, before it enters the internal auditory canal. Topographically such an assessment may have more diagnostic relevance than other forms of electrical stimulation in acoustic neuroma patients. To test this theory the facial nerves of 20 patients with acoustic neuromas were stimulated using ENoG and MCS preoperatively and 1 week postoperatively. Stimulation parameters were comparable and included threshold and suprathreshold levels of stimulation while compound action potential amplitudes and early and late response latencies were monitored. Facial nerve function was assessed clinically using the Stennert grading system. All the patients had clinically normal facial nerve function preoperatively. Normative data suggested a close correlation between threshold and suprathreshold amplitudes generated by both ENoG and MCS. To the contrary, in the pathologic ears there was a higher incidence of stimulus response abnormality determined by MCS than by ENoG. A comparison of these data, tumor size, and postoperative results promotes further evaluation of MCS as a prognostic index in acoustic neuroma patients.", "pages": "502-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "[Normal values and age-related changes in magneto-electric evoked compound muscle potentials].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "1587231", "authors": ["Kloten, H", "Meyer, BU", "Britton, TC", "Benecke, R"], "year": "1992", "journal": "EEG-EMG Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektroenzephalographie, Elektromyographie und verwandte Gebiete", "abstract": "A number of 57 normal subjects was investigated using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal nerve root in order to obtain normative data for central and peripheral motor latencies.

Onset latency, peak to peak amplitude (% of maximal M-wave), duration and configuration of the muscle compound action potentials were evaluated (Fig. 1 and Tab. 1-6). Central and peripheral motor latencies were determined by stimulation over two different points of the neuraxis (cortex/cervical or lumbar nerve roots). Central motor latencies were calculated by subtracting the peripheral conduction time from the onset latency of the fastest cortically evoked muscle response. Not only the peripheral but also the central motor latencies were found to increase in higher ages (Tab. 6).

The influence of TCES on the MAC of halothane (MACH) and its reversibility by a subcutaneous 2 mg/kg naloxone injection were first determined in 20 rats using a randomized blinded protocol. MACH was decreased markedly in stimulated animals (TCES, n = 10) in comparison with sham-operated nonstimulated rats (controls, n = 10): MACH = 0.60 +/- 0.15, mean +/- SD, versus 1.07 +/- 0.05 vol%, P less than 0.001. In TCES animals, naloxone administration restored MACH values to the levels of controls but failed to affect MACH in controls. The influence of the duration of TCES applied prior to MACH determination was further investigated in 30 animals. The magnitude of MACH reduction was significantly increased with the cumulative duration of stimulation. For each duration of stimulation tested, administration of a 5-micrograms intracerebroventricular (icv) dose of the enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan significantly enhanced TCES effects (P less than 0.05).
