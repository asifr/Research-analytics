Eight participants completed three separate sessions: isometric flexor contractions of the left wrist at 20% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) simultaneously with PAS (20s intervals; 14 min duration) delivered at the right median nerve and left primary motor cortex (M1); isometric contractions at 20% of MVC; and PAS only (14 min). Eight further participants completed two sessions of longer duration PAS (28 min): either alone or in conjunction with flexion contractions of the left wrist. Thirty motor potentials (MEPs) were evoked in the right flexor (rFCR) and extensor (rECR) carpi radialis muscles by magnetic stimulation of left M1 prior to the interventions, immediately post-intervention, and 10 min post-intervention. Both 14 and 28 min of combined PAS and (left wrist flexion) contractions resulted in reliable increases in rFCR MEP amplitude, which were not present in rECR. In the PAS only conditions, 14 min of stimulation gave rise to unreliable increases in MEP amplitudes in rFCR and rECR, whereas 28 min of PAS induced small (unreliable) changes only for rFCR. These results support the conclusion that changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway induced by PAS interact with those associated with contraction of the muscles ipsilateral to the site of cortical stimulation. Furthermore, focal contractions applied by the opposite limb increase the extent and muscle specificity of the induced changes in excitability associated with PAS.", "pages": "385-95"}, {"volume": "175", "title": "EEG and neuronavigated single-pulse TMS in the study of the observation/execution matching system: are both techniques measuring the same process?", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18762214", "authors": ["Lepage, JF", "Saint-Amour, D", "Th\u00e9oret, H"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "We report here the case of a hospitalized 11 year-old boy (YP) with a positive diagnosis of 'Childhood Onset Schizophrenia'.

Cortical targets are especially appealing, because they are easily accessible by noninvasive or invasive methods. Applicable techniques include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial electrical stimulation using pulsed or direct current, and epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) with surgically implanted electrodes. In contrast to deep brain stimulation in movement disorders or electroconvulsive therapy in depression, the efficacy of cortical stimulation to treat neurological or psychiatric disorders has not been yet clearly demonstrated. However, encouraging results have been reported in neuropathic pain (for ECS) and depression (for rTMS). In this review, we will consider some principles and mechanisms of action of these methods. First, it must be noted that fibers of intracortical or cortico-subcortical networks are more prone to be activated by the stimulation than cell bodies of local cortical neurons. Hence, the site(s) of action may be distant from the site of stimulation. In addition, various parameters of stimulation (such as stimulation frequency, intensity, or electrode polarity) and the configuration of the induced electrical field greatly influence the nature of the recruited circuits, and therefore, the overall efficacy. Finally, clinical changes may be delayed and prolonged beyond the time of stimulation, complicating programming algorithms in the case of implanted stimulation device. All these features need to be taken into account when considering cortical stimulation as a method of treatment.", "pages": "385-95"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Electrophysiological features of myoclonus-dystonia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "18759341", "authors": ["Li, JY", "Cunic, DI", "Paradiso, G", "Gunraj, C", "Pal, PK", "Lang, AE", "Chen, R"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "It is now well established that the human brain is endowed with a system that matches the observation of actions with their execution. At the motor cortex level, EEG mu rhythm modulation (8-12Hz) and TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are two techniques commonly used to assess brain activity during action observation. While both techniques have reliably demonstrated similarities in the pattern of activity induced by action production and action observation, the relationship they bear with each other remains elusive. In the present study, we combined ongoing EEG recordings and single-pulse TMS during the execution, imagination and observation of simple hand actions. Relationship between MEPs and EEG frequency bands at the individual level was investigated. Our results replicate those obtained independently with both techniques: a significant increase in MEP amplitude and a significant attenuation of the mu rhythm during action observation, imagination and execution compared to rest. Surprisingly, we found no significant correlation between MEP amplitude and mu rhythm modulation. However, modulation in the low to midrange beta (12-18Hz) was related to MEP size during the rest and execution conditions. These results suggest that although mu rhythm and TMS-induced MEPs are sensitive to motor resonance mechanisms, they may reflect different processes taking place within the observation/execution matching system.", "pages": "385-95"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "A neurophysiological study of myoclonus in patients with DYT11 myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "18759336", "authors": ["Marelli, C", "Canafoglia, L", "Zibordi, F", "Ciano, C", "Visani, E", "Zorzi, G", "Garavaglia, B", "Barzaghi, C", "Albanese, A", "Soliveri, P", "Leone, M", "Panzica, F", "Scaioli, V", "Pincherle, A", "Nardocci, N", "Franceschetti, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The effects of a novel repeated muscle vibration intervention (rMV; 100 Hz, 90 min over 3 consecutive days) on corticomotor excitability were studied in healthy subjects.", "pages": "385-95"}]
