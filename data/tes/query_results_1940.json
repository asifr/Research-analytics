The application of rTMS in the left temporoparietal cortex could modulate the neuronal activation and reduce the occurrence of auditory disperceptions. Sixteen schizophrenic patients (treated with atypical antipsycothic drugs) reporting auditory hallucinations were included in the study. Low frequency rTMS (1 Hz) was performed at the 90% of resting motor threshold (MT), during 4 sessions in four consecutive days for 15 minutes each application. Eight patients received active stimulation, while eight patients received sham stimulation. Scale for the assessment of positive symptoms (SAPS), scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) and a scale to asses the severity of the auditory hallucinations (SAH) were administered at the beginning and at regular intervals during the follow-up. The present study confirms the reduction in auditory hallucinations by means of rTMS. The main finding was the long-term reduction in auditory hallucinations in the active group, with a return to the baseline in the sham group. The negative symptomatology improved only in the later sessions and lasted during the follow-up. The improvements in auditory hallucinations and positive symptomatology increased and lasted during the follow-up till the end-point.

However, the precise participation of this region is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 1 Hz rTMS of DLPFCx modifies threshold and tolerance in experimental pain. The effect of 1 Hz rTMS during 15 min at 100% motor threshold was tested in one hundred and eighty right-handed healthy volunteers, using a parallel-group stimulation design. The stimulation sites were right or left DLPFCx, right or left motor cortex, vertex or sham. rTMS was applied in two experimental contexts: (1) To evaluate its transitory effect (interference or facilitation) during cold pressor threshold (CPTh) and tolerance (CPTt) and (2) to evaluate its long-term effect by stimulating before CPTh, CPTt, pain heat thermal threshold, pain pressure threshold and tolerance. During rTMS of right DLPFCx, an increase in left hand CPTt (mean +/- SD; 17.63 s +/- 5.58 to 30.94 s +/- 14.84, P < 0.001) and in right hand CPTt (18.65 s +/- 6.47 to 26.74 s +/- 11.85, P < 0.001) were shown. No other stimulation site modified any of the pain measures during or after rTMS.

Based on the results of electrocorticographic and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings, it has been considered that human rolandic oscillations originate in the anterior bank of the central sulcus (20-Hz rhythm) and the postcentral cortex (10-Hz rhythm): the 20-Hz oscillation is closely related to motor function, while the 10-Hz rhythm is attributed mainly to sensory function. To test whether the rolandic oscillations are functionally relevant to the motor cortical excitability, we examined effects of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left primary motor cortex (M1) on movement-related changes of the rolandic oscillations in 12 normal subjects. MEG data recorded during brisk extension of the right index finger in two different sessions (with and without rTMS conditioning) were compared. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) of the right hand muscle was also measured before and after rTMS to assess the motor cortical excitability. We found that 1-Hz rTMS over M1 significantly reduced the movement-related rebound of the 20-Hz oscillation in association with decreased motor cortical excitability. In particular, movement-related rebound of the 20-Hz rhythm was closely tied with motor cortical excitability. These findings further strengthen the notion of functional relevance of 20-Hz cortical oscillation to motor cortical excitability. In the framework of previous studies, the decrease in movement-related rebound may be regarded as a compensatory reaction to the inhibited cortical activity.", "pages": "97-104"}, {"volume": "566", "title": "Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol applied to visual cortex of anaesthetized cat: effects on visually evoked single-unit activity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "15919717", "authors": ["Moliadze, V", "Giannikopoulos, D", "Eysel, UT", "Funke, K"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "We investigated in 29 healthy subjects a simple model of rapid independent finger movement: the rapid sequential tapping of adjacent fingers. Inter-tap interval (ITI) was measured for adjacent pairs of fingers in each direction. ITI was shorter in the ulnar-->radial direction than in the reverse direction [P < 0.001 for middle to index (M-->I) compared with index to middle (I-->M)]. There was a gradient across the hand such that in the ulnar-->radial direction, little to ring (L-->R) tapping was fastest and M-->I slowest; in the radial-->ulnar direction, the reverse was the case. Rectified surface electromyography (EMG) from finger extensors and flexors was averaged with respect to either the first or second tap. The interval between the flexor EMG burst and the tap was similar irrespective of the order of finger tapping, excluding a mechanical explanation of the timing difference. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied at 0- to 50-ms intervals after the first tap. Interposed TMS delayed the second tap significantly more (P < 0.001) in the M-->I direction than in the I-->M direction. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by TMS interposed between taps showed a greater facilitation in the M-->I than in the I-->M direction (P < 0.001). Increasing intensity of TMS rendered subjects unable to produce the second tap, more frequently in the I-->M direction than in the M-->I direction. We have demonstrated a consistent pattern across the hand and postulate that finger-order-dependent differences in ITI and the gradient of these across the hand may reflect the mechanism of grasping and further that the cortical programming of finger tapping differs depending on finger order.", "pages": "97-104"}, {"volume": "164", "title": "The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on the latencies of vertical saccades.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10591905", "authors": ["Tzelepi, A", "Yang, Q", "Kapoula, Z"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Depending on the interstimulus interval (ISI) between the two pulses intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) or intra-cortical inhibition (ICI) can be observed. Similar patterns of inhibition and facilitation have also been demonstrated in prefrontal and parietal cortices. In order to prove whether principles that govern cortical excitability in the motor system also extend to the visual system and to further characterize possible neural correlates of phosphene generation, we applied short-interval paired-pulse TMS to the occipital cortex. In addition, we examined the effect of different coil orientations on perception of phosphenes induced by paired-pulse TMS. In all of 10 healthy subjects, a general facilitation of phosphene perception could be observed for interstimulus intervals of 2-12 ms (conditioning stimulus (CS) 90% and test stimulus (TS) 100% of subject's phosphene threshold) compared to TS alone. With CS intensity decreasing to 80% or less, the effect diminished. No significant changes occurred when TS intensity was increased to 110%. Phosphene perception was enhanced with an induced current direction from lateral to medial at an ISI of 12 ms. Inhibition was not observed in any condition. Our results indicate that the mechanisms underlying phosphene induction in the visual cortex are different from those underlying intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the motor cortex.", "pages": "97-104"}]
