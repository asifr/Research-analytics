Less attention has been given, however, to cranial stimulation with low-intensity alternating current (AC). Reviewing and discussing these methods simultaneously with special attention to what is known about their mechanisms of action may provide new insights for the field of noninvasive brain stimulation. Direct current appears to modulate spontaneous neuronal activity in a polarity-dependent fashion with site-specific effects that are perpetuated throughout the brain via networks of interneuronal circuits, inducing significant effects on high-order cortical processes implicated in decision making, language, memory, sensory perception, and pain. AC stimulation has also been associated with a significant behavioral and clinical impact, but the mechanism of AC stimulation has been underinvestigated in comparison with DC stimulation. Even so, preliminary studies show that although AC stimulation has only modest effects on cortical excitability, it has been shown to induce synchronous changes in brain activity as measured by EEG activity. Thus, cranial AC stimulation may render its effects not by polarizing brain tissue, but rather via rhythmic stimulation that synchronizes and enhances the efficacy of endogenous neurophysiologic activity. Alternatively, secondary nonspecific central and peripheral effects may explain the clinical outcomes of DC or AC stimulation. Here the authors review what is known about DC and AC stimulation, and they discuss features that remain to be investigated.", "pages": "285-307"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Increased motor cortical excitability after whole-hand electrical stimulation: a TMS study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "20036618", "authors": ["Golaszewski, SM", "Bergmann, J", "Christova, M", "Nardone, R", "Kronbichler, M", "Rafolt, D", "Gallasch, E", "Staffen, W", "Ladurner, G", "Beisteiner, R"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To examine the neuromodulatory effect of whole-hand mesh-glove (MG) stimulation on motor cortical pathways, we explored motor cortical excitability before and after suprathreshold whole-hand MG stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).", "pages": "285-307"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Quantitative assessment of myelopathy patients using motor evoked potentials produced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "20033461", "authors": ["Nakamae, T", "Tanaka, N", "Nakanishi, K", "Fujimoto, Y", "Sasaki, H", "Kamei, N", "Hamasaki, T", "Yamada, K", "Yamamoto, R", "Izumi, B", "Ochi, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society", "abstract": "Twenty-eight healthy volunteers (14 controls) were studied at baseline, immediately post and 1h post-MG stimulation for 30 min.

But there are no large studies on MEPs using TMS in myelopathy patients. The purpose of this study is to confirm the usefulness of MEPs for the assessment of the myelopathy and to investigate the use of MEPs using TMS as a screening tool for myelopathy. We measured the MEPs of 831 patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of myelopathy using TMS. The MEPs from the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and abductor hallucis (AH) muscles were evoked by transcranial magnetic brain stimulation. Central motor conduction time (CMCT) is calculated by subtracting the peripheral conduction time from the MEP latency. Later, 349 patients had surgery for myelopathy (operative group) and 482 patients were treated conservatively (nonoperative group). CMCTs in the operative group and nonoperative group were assessed. MEPs were prolonged in 711 patients (86%) and CMCTs were prolonged in 493 patients (59%) compared with the control patients. CMCTs from the ADM and AH in the operative group were significantly more prolonged than that in the nonoperative group. All patients in the operative group showed prolongation of MEPs or CMCTs or multiphase of the MEP wave. MEP abnormalities are useful for an electrophysiological evaluation of myelopathy patients. Moreover, MEPs may be effective parameters in spinal pathology for deciding the operative treatment.", "pages": "285-307"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Muscle contractile function and neural control after repetitive endurance cycling.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "6093680", "authors": ["Ross, EZ", "Gregson, W", "Williams, K", "Robertson, C", "George, K"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Medicine and science in sports and exercise", "abstract": "To investigate whether a period of 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over M1 preconditioned by tDCS improves bradykinesia of the upper limb in Parkinson's disease (PD). Fifteen patients with PD performed index finger, hand tapping and horizontal pointing movements as well as reach-to-grasp movements with either hand before (baseline conditions) and after a period of 1 Hz rTMS preconditioned by (1) sham, (2) anodal or (3) cathodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the more affected body side. Movement kinematics was analysed using an ultrasound-based motion analyser at baseline, immediately after and 30 min after each stimulation session. Dopaminergic medication was continued. Compared to baseline, 1 Hz rTMS significantly increased the frequency of index finger and hand tapping as well as horizontal pointing movements performed with the contralateral hand. Movement frequency increased up to 40% over 30 min after cessation of the stimulation. Preconditioning with cathodal tDCS, but not with anodal tDCS, reduced the effectiveness of 1 Hz rTMS to improve tapping and pointing movements. There was no significant increase of movement frequencies of the ipsilateral hand induced by 1 Hz rTMS preconditioned by either tDCS session. Movement kinematics of reach-to-grasp movements were not significantly influenced by either stimulation session. In PD the beneficial effects of 1 Hz rTMS over the primary motor cortex on bradykinesia of simple finger, hand and pointing movements is reduced by preconditioning with cathodal tDCS, but not with anodal tDCS. Preconditioning with tDCS is a powerful tool to modulate the behavioural effect of 1 Hz rTMS over the primary motor cortex in PD.", "pages": "285-307"}, {"volume": "198", "title": "Probing the corticospinal link between the motor cortex and motoneurones: some neglected aspects of human motor cortical function.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "2860322", "authors": ["Petersen, NC", "Butler, JE", "Taylor, JL", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)", "abstract": "Interest in techniques of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been growing exponentially in the last decade.

In this study, we performed a systematic review to identify NIBS methods with promising preliminary clinical results that were not fully developed and adopted into clinical practice, and discuss its clinical, research and device characteristics. We identified five devices (transmeatal cochlear laser stimulation, transcranial micropolarization, transcranial electrostimulation, cranial electric stimulation and stimulation with weak electromagnetic fields) and compared them with two established NIBS devices (transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) and with well-known drugs used in neuropsychiatry (pramipexole and escitalopram) in order to understand the reasons why they failed to reach clinical practice and further steps of research development. Finally, we also discuss novel NIBS devices that have recently showed promising results: brain ultrasound and transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation. Our results show that some of the reasons for the failure of NIBS devices with promising clinical findings are the difficulty to disseminate results, lack of controlled studies, duration of research development, mixed results and lack of standardization.", "pages": "285-307"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in a patient with therapy-resistant major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4 Pt 2", "pmid": "2874365", "authors": ["Palm, U", "Keeser, D", "Schiller, C", "Fintescu, Z", "Reisinger, E", "Baghai, TC", "Mulert, C", "Padberg, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry", "abstract": "Neuropathic pain in patients with MS is frequent and is associated with a great interference with daily life activities.

Pain was measured using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the short form McGill questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Quality of life was measured using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 scale (MSQoL-54). Depressive symptoms and anxiety were also evaluated as confounding factors using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and VAS for anxiety. Evaluations were performed at baseline, immediately after the end of treatment, and once a week during a 3-week follow-up period. Following anodal but not sham tDCS over the motor cortex, there was a significant pain improvement as assessed by VAS for pain and McGill questionnaire, and of overall quality of life.
