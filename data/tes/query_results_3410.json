Transcranial cortical and cervical root magnetic stimulation showed bilaterally delayed thenar responses with normal central conduction time. Needle electromyography demonstrated a chronic denervation pattern with large polyphasic motor units in several muscles of the upper limbs. Sensory symptoms were mild and limited to paresthesias in the fingertips. Sensory nerve conduction velocity and sensory nerve action potential amplitudes were normal in elbow-to-wrist and wrist-to-finger segments of the median and ulnar nerves, but there was a delayed cortical response and unrecognizable Erb's point and cervical responses in the somatosensory evoked potentials to median nerve electrical stimulation. Electrophysiologic examination was normal in most nerves of the lower limbs. These two patients, meeting clinical and electrophysiologic criteria of multifocal neuropathy with conduction block, demonstrate that sensory fibers may also be involved in this syndrome.", "pages": "2024-8"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "[The participation of the serotonin link in the neurochemical mechanism of transcranial electroanalgesia].", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "9026257", "authors": ["Lebedev, VP", "Savchenko, AB", "Otellin, VA", "Kucherenko, RP"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Fiziologicheski\u012d zhurnal imeni I.M.

It is, however, painful and not generally used for awake subjects. By means of topical anaesthesia and nerve blockades we wanted to find out which structures of the scalp and cranium are sensitive to electric TCS. Altogether 21 subjects participated in the present study. Our data show that pain experienced by the subjects during electric TCS is brought about by activation of the pain receptors in the scalp under the stimulating electrodes. Topical anaesthetic cream is incapable of attenuating this pain. The periosteum does not seem to be much more sensitive electric stimulation than rest of the scalp. Furthermore, contractions of facial and neck muscles do not seem to have a significant role in pain generation in electric TCS. Pain can be prevented if sufficiently large areas of the scalp are properly anaesthetized before stimulation by e.g. blockade of the major nerves responsible for the sensation of the stimulus area.", "pages": "2024-8"}, {"volume": "69", "title": "[Efferent spinal evoked potentials by transcranial magnetic stimulation in dog].", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "8551090", "authors": ["Kajihara, H"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Nihon Seikeigeka Gakkai zasshi", "abstract": "We have investigated the utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation for spinal cord monitoring, experimentally in dog. Experiment 1. Spinal cord potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TCMS) were recorded in the epidural space, using a bipolar mapping spinal electrode, and compared with potentials by transcranial electrical stimulation (TCES). Experiment 2. The effect of lateral compression on the spinal cord was observed, recording from 3 bipolar electrodes attached to the bilateral and dorsal midline epidural space. Experiment 3. The potentials evoked by TCMS were compared with the afferent potentials evoked by spinal electrical stimulation after lateral compression of the spinal cord. Efferent spinal cord potentials evoked by TCMS consisted of a 1 st component of high amplitude and short latency and a later polyphasic component with prolonged latency. The 1 st component was stable, and not affected by intravenous anesthesia. The potentials evoked by TCMS were similar to the potentials evoked by mild TCES, and the mean latency of the 1 st component by TCMS was very similar to that by mild TCES. After releasing the lateral compression, the amplitude recorded from the contralateral side of the spinal cord showed better recovery than that from the compression side. In experiment 3, for both potentials after good recovery, the latency was almost completely normalized, but the amplitude gradually decreased after two days. When there was relatively good recovery in the potentials by magnetic stimulation, the hind limbs resumed normal function. However when there was poor recovery in the potentials, the hind limbs showed a poor functional recovery. From these findings, we concluded that the potentials evoked by TCMS seem to reflect the function of the posterolateral portion of the spinal cord. These potentials were therefore a good indicator for monitoring the motor function of the spinal cord.", "pages": "2024-8"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "A stable late soleus EMG response elicited by cortical stimulation during voluntary ankle dorsiflexion.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7489691", "authors": ["Ertekin, C", "Erta\u015f, M", "Efendi, H", "Larsson, LE", "Sirin, H", "Ara\u00e7, N", "Toygar, A", "Demir, Y"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation was performed in 47 experiments on 42 normal adult subjects. Surface compound muscle action potentials were recorded from the antagonistic tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles. A stable late response recorded from SOL during voluntary ankle dorsiflexion is described and called soleus MEP-80. Its origin has been studied with different experimental procedures. (1) It is only obtained during active voluntary dorsiflexion of the ankle within 70-100 msec (mean 86.9 +/- 6.4 msec) whereas passive dorsiflexion does not promote such a response. The size of SOL MEP-80 was always bigger than the primary SOL response. (2) A similar constant response has not been obtained during voluntary plantar flexion from SOL and TA muscles. (3) SOL MEP-80 is not changed significantly by the Jendrassik manoeuvre. (4) It is not obtained or is suppressed when the subject is sitting with the feet free in space. On the other hand, it is obtained when the subject is standing, especially when standing is made difficult. (5) SOL MEP-80 has not been obtained by brain-stem, spinal cord or root stimulation. (6) A later response of longer than 100 msec latency was sometimes obtained at rest but such an S100 soleus response was abolished or transformed to the SOL MEP-80 immediately during ankle dorsiflexion. (7) It is concluded that SOL MEP-80 is a polysynaptic extensor response related to postural mechanisms and originating through convergence of descending motor commands and peripheral sensory feedback.", "pages": "2024-8"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Inhibitory phenomena in individual motor units induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7489690", "authors": ["Classen, J", "Benecke, R"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "It is well known that a silent period (SP) can be observed in voluntary tonic EMG activity starting directly after the initial early response when magnetic stimuli are delivered through the skull over the contralateral primary motor cortex. It is, however, unknown as to how an individual motoneurone (MN) contributes to the SP observed in the surface EMG. The present investigation was conducted to investigate inhibitory phenomena at the level of individual motor units. It demonstrates that the duration of the SP in single motor units is inhomogeneously distributed within the pool of active MNs. At various stimulation strengths, SP durations in single motor units can be similar or longer when compared to that observable in surface EMG records. In some motor units, which show low thresholds for early excitation and appearance of the SP, durations of SP can exceed 1000 msec. The length of suppression of spontaneous MN firing is maximal at stimulus intensities a little higher than those required for an early excitatory response. Although in general thresholds for early excitation and appearance of SPs are similar, at threshold stimulation in a number of trials inhibitory effects on the firing of voluntarily activated motoneurones were present, even in the absence of early excitations. This proves the independent nature of inhibitory as opposed to excitatory effects induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation. An SP in the absence of early excitation underlines its cortical origin. Inhibition and excitation of single MNs were maximal over the same small scalp area. We suggest that cortical inhibitory control plays an important role in the organization of natural movements.", "pages": "2024-8"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Motor cortex changes in a patient with hemicerebellectomy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7489689", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Restuccia, D", "Nardone, R", "Leggio, MG", "Oliviero, A", "Profice, P", "Tonali, P", "Molinari, M"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "To evaluate reorganisation of motor pathways following a cerebellar lesion, we studied motor cortex excitatory responses and inhibitory effects after transcranial stimulation, together with segmental spinal cord excitability, in one patient who had undergone hemicerebellectomy. We compared the results obtained using different forms of stimulation capable of activating the cortico-spinal tract at different sites. Results were compared between sides. We previously reported that the threshold for responses is higher in the motor cortex contralateral to the impaired hemicerebellum and the right/left threshold asymmetry is clearly greater than normal when a circular coil centred over the vertex is used. In the present study, using electrical anodal stimulation, no side difference was observed. Significant interside differences were absent also when the durations of the silent periods or the mean amplitude of the flexor carpi radialis H reflex between the two sides were compared. The outcome is that the interside differences previously observed are mainly due to reduction in the intrinsic excitability properties of the motor cortex functionally related to the impaired hemicerebellum and not to modification of the inhibitory properties of the cortex or to spinal mechanisms.", "pages": "2024-8"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Trial-to-trial variability of corticospinal volleys in human subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7489684", "authors": ["Burke, D", "Hicks, R", "Stephen, J", "Woodforth, I", "Crawford, M"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The trial-to-trial variability of the different components of corticospinal volleys evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex using a constant stimulus intensity was measured from epidural recordings during surgery to correct scoliosis. The recordings were made when there was no operative interference, and blood pressure, temperature, ventilation and anaesthetic regimen were stable. A simple D wave with a single negative peak of 10-30 microV amplitude was recorded in 4 patients. It varied little in amplitude (S.D.s < 8% for 100 consecutive single responses). In 4 patients the stimulus was adjusted to produce a complex D wave with 3 components, the earliest 2 of which arise from subcortical/brain-stem sites. The variability of amplitude of these components was high (S.D.s of 13-50%), but the variability of latency was low (S.D.s of 2-3%). Eighteen I waves were recorded in 6 of the subjects. Their variability from trial to trial was similar to that of the components of the complex D wave. It is argued that there would be greater trial-to-trial variability of the corticospinal volley in the awake state, particularly when the stimulus was magnetic rather than electrical.

The main features of the method introduced were: (i) use of the recharging time of the magnetic stimulator for response recording to the electrical stimulus, (ii) use of specific stimulus timing with respect to the motor unit discharges, and (iii) on-line display with statistical testing of the response functions allowing to stop stimulus application, if the responses to both types of stimuli had reached statistical significance.

The Labmag product was compared with a commercially available high frequency stimulator, MagPro. The electric fields induced by Labmag were half the size of those induced by MagPro at identical stimulus intensities. Using a leaky integrator to simulate the effects on neurons, only minor differences in integrated electric fields were observed. There were no changes of the electric fields in relation to coil geometry. A minor difference in electric fields (1.0 +/- 0.8%) was observed when the polarity of the capacitor voltage alternated.
