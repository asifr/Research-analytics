The parietal cortex has long been recognized as a neural substrate of spatial attention, but the unique role of distinct parietal subregions has remained unclear. Using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that the angular gyrus of the right parietal cortex mediates spatial orienting during two distinct time periods after the onset of a behaviorally relevant event. The biphasic involvement of the angular gyrus suggests that both fast and slow visual pathways are necessary for orienting spatial attention.", "pages": "217-8"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "The antinociceptive effect of transcranial electrostimulation with combined direct and alternating current in freely moving rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "14980928", "authors": ["Nekhendzy, V", "Fender, CP", "Davies, MF", "Lemmens, HJ", "Kim, MS", "Bouley, DM", "Maze, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Transcranial electrostimulation (TES) has been reported to elicit significant analgesia, allowing a substantial reduction of intraoperative opioids. Acceptance of TES into clinical practice is hampered by lack of controlled clinical trials and inconclusive animal data regarding the TES antinociceptive action. This inconclusive data may be explained, in part, by failure in rat experiments to simulate the variables used in humans when TES electrodes are positioned on the skin. In this study we validated the TES antinociceptive effect in a novel animal model of cutaneously administered TES, when the stimulating conditions mimic the ones used in clinical practice. The antinociceptive effect was assessed by measuring nociceptive thresholds in the tail-flick and hot-plate latency tests in awake, unrestrained male rats. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and mixed-effects population modeling. The administration of TES at 2.25 mA produced an almost immediate, sustained, frequency-dependent (40-60 Hz) antinociceptive effect, reaching approximately 50% of the maximal possible value. We conclude that an antinociceptive effect of cutaneously administered TES can be demonstrated in the rat. Some characteristics of the effect suggest an important role of the sensory nerves of the rat's scalp in mediating the TES antinociceptive response.", "pages": "217-8"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Improved neuromonitoring during spinal surgery using double-train transcranial electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14977231", "authors": ["Journ\u00e9e, HL", "Polak, HE", "de Kleuver, M", "Langeloo, DD", "Postma, AA"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "abstract": "Transcranial electrostimulation produces a significant, frequency-dependent antinociceptive effect that may be mediated by cutaneous nerves of the scalp.", "pages": "217-8"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Using the international 10-20 EEG system for positioning of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "14977202", "authors": ["Herwig, U", "Satrapi, P", "Sch\u00f6nfeldt-Lecuona, C"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Brain topography", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) have become an important technique for monitoring spinal cord function intra-operatively, but can fail in some patients. A new technique of double-train stimulation is described. A multipulse transcranial electrical stimulus is preceded by a preconditioning pulse train that leads to larger MEP responses. An MEP monitoring system was adapted for double-train transcranial stimulation (DTS). MEP responses from 160 anterior tibial muscles obtained by double-train stimulation were analysed. All patients received propofol/remifentanil/O2/N2O anaesthesia. Fifty-two (83%) out of 63 single-train tibial MEPs with response amplitudes below 100 microV were magnified to over 100 microV, with an inter-train (inter-stimulus) interval ITI = 10-35 ms. These 63 amplitudes were magnified by an overall logarithmic mean factor of 15.5. For 97 MEPs with amplitudes above 100 microV, the logarithmic mean facilitation factor was 2.4. It was concluded that double-train TES stimulation can markedly facilitate responses to a single stimulus train (STS). The facilitation appears to be most effective when the responses to STS would otherwise be small or absent. This preconditioning stimulation technique is therefore useful when an STS leads to responses that are too small for effective monitoring.", "pages": "217-8"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Learning modifies subsequent induction of long-term potentiation-like and long-term depression-like plasticity in human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "14973238", "authors": ["Ziemann, U", "Ili\u0107, TV", "Ilia\u0107, TV", "Pauli, C", "Meintzschel, F", "Ruge, D"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "The International 10-20 system for EEG electrode placement is increasingly applied for the positioning of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in cognitive neuroscience and in psychiatric treatment studies.

It is a long-held hypothesis that modification of synaptic strength along cortical horizontal connections through long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) forms one important mechanism for learning-induced cortical plasticity. Strong evidence in favor of this hypothesis was provided for rat primary motor cortex (M1) by showing that motor learning reduced subsequent LTP but increased LTD. Whether a similar relationship exists in humans is unknown. Here, we induced LTP-like and LTD-like plasticity in the intact human M1 by an established paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol. PAS consisted of 200 pairs of electrical stimulation of the right median nerve, followed by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand area of the left M1 at an interval equaling the individual N20 latency of the median nerve somatosensory-evoked cortical potential (PAS(N20)) or N20-5 msec (PAS(N20-5)). PAS(N20) induced reproducibly a LTP-like long-lasting (>30 min) increase in motor-evoked potentials from the left M1 to a thumb abductor muscle of the right hand, whereas PAS(N20-5) induced a LTD-like decrease. Repeated fastest possible thumb abduction movements resulted in learning, defined by an increase in maximum peak acceleration of the practiced movements, and prevented subsequent PAS(N20)-induced LTP-like plasticity but enhanced subsequent PAS(N20-5)-induced LTD-like plasticity. The same number of repeated slow thumb abduction movements did not result in learning and had no effects on PAS-induced plasticity. Findings support the view that learning in human M1 occurs through LTP-like mechanisms.", "pages": "217-8"}, {"volume": "162", "title": "[Changes to hemodynamics and immune status of the patients operated for lung cancer using anesthesia with transcranial electrostimulation of brain opioid system].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "14768108", "authors": ["Dimitrienko, AI", "Kovalev, MG", "Komarova, MO", "Leosko, VA", "Lebedev, VP", "Orlov, SV", "Ses', TP"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Vestnik khirurgii imeni I.
