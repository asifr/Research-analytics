However, MEPs recorded using epidural electrodes in the presence of nitrous oxide are highly reproducible from trial to trial. We wished to establish the reproducibility over time of the CMAP produced by supramaximal transcranial electrical stimulation of the human motor cortex. Cascades of 100 successive CMAPs were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscles of six anesthetized patients undergoing scoliosis surgery, in response to transcranial electrical stimuli of > 500 V. Satisfactory CMAPs could be recorded in the presence of nitrous oxide, but not isoflurane. Latencies and amplitudes were reproducible in repeated sequences of 100 responses. However, amplitude and, to a lesser extent, latency, were highly variable within a sequence. In addition, occasional individual stimuli, although rarely successive ones, failed to evoke a CMAP. CMAPs have a much higher trial-to-trial variability than corticospinal volleys recorded from the epidural space. Using the present methodology it would be difficult to rely on CMAP recordings as an indicator of corticospinal function in the clinical monitoring situation.", "pages": "744-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulations of the rat.

Therefore we characterized the effect of acute or chronic stimulations with RTMS on the induction of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced clonic seizures in the rat. Male Wistar rats were stimulated with a 13-cm coil with a stimulus frequency of 50 Hz. The motor threshold (Tm) was determined by a single transcranial stimulus. Acute stimulation was performed with a stimulus intensity of 0.9 x Tm and 1.5 x Tm using a duration of the train of stimuli of five seconds. Chronic stimulation was performed with a duration of the train of stimuli of one and five seconds using a stimulus intensity of 1.8 x Tm, every day for 30 days. Time to onset of PTZ-induced clonic seizure was determined after the acute stimulation or the last stimulation in chronic RTMS. In the groups of rats receiving acute RTMS (0.9 and 1.5 x Tm) no seizures developed. No differences were observed in time to onset of clonic seizures after PTZ injection compared to control rats. In the group of rats receiving chronic RTMS some rats showed facial contractions, chewing or head movements during or immediately after the stimulations. None of the rats developed tonic or clonic seizures in relation to RTMS. Time to onset of PTZ clonic seizures was reduced in both groups receiving RTMS with a stimulus duration of one (P < 0.01) and five (P < 0.05) seconds compared to control rats. The results from this study suggest that acute suprathreshold stimulation with a stimulus frequency of 50 Hz does not affect the induction of clonic PTZ seizures, whereas chronic (daily) stimulations have a facilitatory effect. This indicates that chronic stimulation with RTMS may induce a kindling process in the rat. Chronic RTMS stimulation may therefore represent an interesting alternative non-invasively kindling model to chemical and electrical stimulations.", "pages": "744-9"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Effects of judgement process on motor evoked potentials in Go/No-go hand movement task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "8861114", "authors": ["Hoshiyama, M", "Koyama, S", "Kitamura, Y", "Shimojo, M", "Watanabe, S", "Kakigi, R"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Neuroscience research", "abstract": "We examined the motor evoked potentials (MEP) of the forearm muscles following transcranial magnetic stimulation after the Go/No-go reaction-time hands movement in ten normal subjects.

In this study, relationships between stimulus intensity and MEP latency, amplitude, duration, and area of the hypothenar muscles were assessed in 12 right- and 14 left-handed subjects. Effects of handedness, coil orientation, intensity of stimulation, and intersubject variability on these relationships were analyzed. The intraindividual variability was analyzed as the standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV) of four trials. The mean response threshold was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) for preferential stimulation (32%) than for nonpreferential stimulation (45%). With increasing stimulus intensities, MEP amplitudes still increased at 100% intensity in some subjects while in others the stimulus response-relations saturated. MEP amplitudes at an intensity of 20% above threshold ranged between 6 and 100% of MEP amplitude at maximum intensity. Differences between dominant and non-dominant hands were not seen, regardless of handedness. The SD of latency, amplitude, duration, or area depended on stimulus intensity. The CV however, was influenced by the intensity of stimulation: The CV for amplitude decreased from 46% at threshold to 10% at higher intensities. The variability of the MEP amplitude is only related to stimulus intensity when it is expressed in relation to it but not when it is expressed in absolute terms. The stimulus-response relation offers a more extensive measure of cortical excitability than the use of thresholds alone for the measurement of cortical excitability. The question can be raised whether high intensities should be used for clinical testing rather than threshold-related intensities.", "pages": "744-9"}, {"volume": "347", "title": "[Modulation of transcranial electroanalgesia by effecting the serotoninergic system of the brain].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8768093", "authors": ["Savchenko, AB", "Lebedev, VP", "Nozdrachev, AD"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Doklady Akademii nauk / [Rossi\u012dskaia akademii nauk]", "abstract": "Relatively pain-free excitation of both superficial and deep nerves in the assessment of nerve conduction velocity is the main advantage of magnetic stimulation over conventional electrical stimulation. General utility of this technique has often been called into question by a number of authors because of difficulties in obtaining supramaximal responses or in determining the exact site of impulse generation when stimulating a peripheral nerve distally. Meanwhile, magnetic stimulation of the cervical and lumbar roots has become a routine procedure for the assessment of peripheral conduction time and is combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in the assessment of central conduction time. Recent developments in magnetic coil and stimulator design have improved the focality of the stimulus, so that selective supramaximal stimuli can be delivered to commonly studied peripheral nerves in the upper and lower limbs, both at proximal and distal segments. Furthermore, the introduction of small figure-8-shaped coils enables safe diagnosis of chronic compression syndromes with exact assessment of conduction velocities over short distances of peripheral nerves. The ease of application of magnetic stimulation and the absence of pain for the patient make magnetic stimulation a particularly attractive method for also investigating patients with demyelinating polyneuropathies, and will certainly replace conventional electrical stimulation in the near future.", "pages": "744-9"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Magnetic stimulation in the assessment of peripheral nerve disorders.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8732203", "authors": ["Benecke, R"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Bailli\u00e8re's clinical neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive method for assessing the motor function in humans. It is well established that orientation of the magnetic coil plays an important role on the stimulation effects of the motor cortex. However, there has been a few study regarding the effect of magnetic coil orientation on the efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation. Therefore, in the present study, I carried out two experiments to clarify the relationship between the magnetic coil orientation and the stimulation effects of human peripheral nerve. First, median nerve was stimulated at the elbow and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of abductor pollicis brevis muscle were recorded in 8 subjects at 4 different directions of the induced current. Two eight-shaped coils, 10 cm and 3.5 cm in outer diameter, were used. Stimulus intensities of big and small coils were 850 V and 90%, respectively. Motor threshold was measured at 4 directions with the big coil by increasing stimulus intensity up to 850 V from 150 V at a step of 50 V. It was found that the amplitude of the CMAP was the greatest in outer direction (toward the radial side) using either the big coil or the small coil. There was no significant difference between the amplitude in outer direction and that of supramaximal electrical stimulation. Motor threshold was the lowest in outer direction. Then, I measured the induced current of the big and small coils in a tank filled with saline that mimicked the forearm. The induced currents by both big and small coils were the largest and the first spatial derivatives of the induced electric field were the greatest in outer direction. These results suggest that the orientation of the eight-shaped coil is important for peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation. The fact that the forearm is a restrictive volume conductor may result in the different effects of coil orientation on the excitement of the peripheral nerve.", "pages": "744-9"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "[Changes in magnetic coil orientation affect the stimulation effects of human peripheral nerve].", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "8727356", "authors": ["Sun, SJ"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Fukuoka igaku zasshi = Hukuoka acta medica", "abstract": "Area and depth penetration of transcranial stimulation methods such as transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) are poorly defined.

Tes induced contralateral finger contractions and in T2* weighted images a transient signal increase was observed in the area underlying the electrodes. Compared with the signal obtained during sequential finger movements, the area activated by TES was more localized, signal amplitude, was smaller and there was no post-stimulus undershoot.

The former type of response is due to stimulation of tactile afferents in the skin of the digits, whereas the latter also activates muscle receptors. Previous studies have provided good evidence that long-latency reflex responses to stretch of distal muscles involve activity in a transcortical reflex pathway. The present experiments examined whether cutaneous reflexes also utilise a transcortical route. Transcranial magnetic or electrical stimuli were given over the motor cortex to evoke EMG activity during the period of the long-latency reflex response. When evoked by muscle stretch the responses to magnetic stimulation were facilitated more than those to electric stimulation. In contrast, facilitation was equal during the long-latency reflex elicited by cutaneous stimulation. Because of the different ways in which electrical and magnetic stimuli are believed to activate the motor cortex, we interpret these results to mean that the long-latency response to skin stretch is not mediated by a transcortical mechanism in the majority of subjects, whereas that following muscle stretch is. However, these are average data. In a few individual subjects, the opposite results were obtained. We suggest that there may be differences between subjects in the transcortical contribution to long-latency reflex responses. The implication is that, under normal circumstances, several pathways may contribute to these responses. If so, the relative roles of the pathways may change during different tasks, and in pathological states lesions in one system may well be accompanied by compensatory changes in other systems.", "pages": "744-9"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "The contribution of transcortical pathways to long-latency stretch and tactile reflexes in human hand muscles.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8721163", "authors": ["Macefield, VG", "Rothwell, JC", "Day, BL"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
