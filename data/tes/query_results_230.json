Most neurons rapidly die after injury. Even if the injured CNS neurons do not die in a short time, the neurons eventually die because they are not able to regenerate their axons to reconnect with their normal targets. In addition, neurons are normally not replaced. Therefore, much work has been directed toward understanding of the molecular regulation of the CNS degeneration following injury, and different experimental strategies are being used to try to protect the damaged neurons. Following axonal lesion, the neurons not only need to survive but also to reconnect to be functionally relevant, and efforts are directed toward not only survival but also axonal regeneration and proper rewiring of injured neurons. Recent experimental data suggest that electrical activity, endogenous or exogenous, can enhance neuronal survival and regeneration in vitro and in vivo. This chapter reviews the evidence that have been obtained on the role of neuronal electrical activity on neuroprotection. We will develop perspectives toward neuroprotection and regeneration of adult lesioned CNS neurons based on electrical activity-dependent cell survival that may be applicable to various diseases of the CNS.", "pages": "19-38"}, {"volume": "22 Suppl 3", "title": "Potential interests and limits of magnetic and electrical stimulation techniques to assess neuromuscular fatigue.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23182636", "authors": ["Millet, GY", "Bachasson, D", "Temesi, J", "Wuyam, B", "F\u00e9asson, L", "Verg\u00e8s, S", "L\u00e9vy, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuromuscular disorders : NMD", "abstract": "Neuromuscular function can change under different conditions such as ageing, training/detraining, long-term spaceflight, environmental conditions (e.g. hypoxia, hyperthermia), disease, therapy/retraining programs and also with the appearance of fatigue. Neuromuscular fatigue can be defined as any decrease in maximal voluntary strength or power. There is no standardized method to induce fatigue and various protocols involving different contraction patterns (such as sustained or intermittent submaximal isometric or dynamic contractions on isokinetic or custom chairs) have been used. Probably due to lack of motivation/cooperation, results of fatigue resistance protocols are more variable in patients than in healthy subjects. Magnetic and electrical stimulation techniques allow non-invasive assessment of central and peripheral origins of fatigue. They also allow investigation of different types of muscle fatigue when combining various types of stimulation with force/surface EMG measurements. Since maximal electrical stimuli may be uncomfortable or even sometimes painful, several alternative methods have been recently proposed: submaximal muscle stimulation, low/high-frequency paired pulses instead of tetanic stimuli and the use of magnetic stimulation at the peripheral level.", "pages": "19-38"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Intraoperative monitoring of carotid endarterectomy by transcranial motor evoked potential: a multicenter study of 600 patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "23200315", "authors": ["Malcharek, MJ", "Ulkatan, S", "Marin\u00f2, V", "Geyer, M", "Llad\u00f3-Carb\u00f3, E", "Perez-Fajardo, G", "Arranz-Arranz, B", "Climent, J", "Aloj, F", "Franco, E", "Chiacchiari, L", "Kulpok, A", "Sablotzki, A", "Hennig, G", "Deletis, V"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study was to investigate the utility of motor evoked potential monitoring elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation (tcMEP) during CEA in addition to the established median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (mSSEPs).", "pages": "19-38"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "[Stimulation of primary motor cortex and reorganization of cortical function].", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "23196556", "authors": ["Saitoh, Y", "Hosomi, K", "Maruo, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Rinsh\u014d shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "abstract": "We retrospectively reviewed data from 600 patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia with monitoring of mSSEPs and tcMEPs in a multicenter study.

EMCS has been used for the treatment of neuropathic pain, Parkinson's syndrome, and recovery of motor paresis. Since 2000, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been developed for the treatment of various neurological disorders. rTMS is a non-invasive method with almost no adverse effects. In the USA, rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was approved for the treatment of major depression in 2008. rTMS of the primary motor cortex (M1) has been studied worldwide for the treatment of neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease, motor paresis after stroke, and other neurological problems. For neuropathic pain, high-frequency rTMS of M1 is safe and significantly effective for consecutive 14 days. After cessation of rTMS, pain gradually returned within two weeks. For 'Kaifukuki' rehabilitation, high-frequency rTMS of affected M1 seemed to be effective for recovery of hand function. And even after cessation of rTMS, the recovery would be better than usual rehabilitation for two weeks. New methods and devices for rTMS therapy are under development, and rTMS of the M1 is likely to be established as an effective therapy for some neurological disorders.", "pages": "19-38"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Could dual-hemisphere transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduce spasticity after stroke?", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10699400", "authors": ["Vandermeeren, Y", "Lefebvre, S", "Desfontaines, P", "Laloux, P"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Acta neurologica Belgica", "abstract": "Investigations of the causal involvement of particular brain areas and interconnections in behavior require an external stimulation system with reasonable spatio-temporal resolution. Current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technology is limited to stimulating a single brain area once in a given trial. Here, we present a feasibility study for a novel TMS system based on multi-channel reconfigurable coils. With this hardware, researchers will be able to stimulate multiple brain sites in any temporal order in a trial. The system employs a wire-mesh coil, constructed using x- and y-directional wires. By varying the current direction and/or strength on each wire, we can configure the proposed mesh-wire coil into a standard loop coil and figure-eight coil of varying size. This provides maximum flexibility to the experimenter in that the location and extent of stimulation on the brain surface can be modified depending on experimental requirement. Moreover, one can dynamically and automatically modify the site(s) of stimulation several times within the span of seconds. By pre-storing various sequences of excitation patterns inside a control unit, one can explore the effect of dynamic TMS on behavior, in associative learning, and as rehabilitative therapy. Here, we present a computer simulation and bench experiments that show the feasibility of the dynamically-reconfigurable coil.", "pages": "19-38"}, {"volume": "24 Suppl 1", "title": "The current perspective of neuromodulation techniques in the treatment of alcohol addiction: a systematic review.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "20471549", "authors": ["Herremans, SC", "Baeken, C"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Psychiatria Danubina", "abstract": "Aphasia effects up to 38% of acute stroke patients.
