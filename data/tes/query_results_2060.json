Although the clinical relevance of the putative C3/4 PS in humans is not clear, there is some evidence indicating that drive to upper limb muscles via this nonmonosynaptic pathway is upregulated as a compensatory mechanism in stroke and in Parkinson's disease. The authors investigated whether descending drive via the C3/4 PS to affected limb wrist flexors of moderately to well-recovered chronic stroke patients is upregulated compared with controls. The extent of descending drive via the C3/4 PS was assessed in seven patients and seven control subjects during the onset of cocontraction of the biceps brachii and flexor carpi radialis (FCR), during which transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to evoke motor potentials in FCR. Responses were conditioned by subthreshold stimulation of the musculocutaneous nerve. The extent of this facilitation was taken as a measure of the proportion of drive to FCR motoneurons being transmitted via the C3/4 PS. Patients revealed greater facilitation than control subjects, suggesting that descending drive to forearm flexors was being transmitted via the C3/4 PS as a compensation mechanism after stroke.", "pages": "2309-15"}, {"volume": "163", "title": "Neurophysiological examination of the corticospinal system and voluntary motor control in motor-incomplete human spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15616965", "authors": ["McKay, WB", "Lee, DC", "Lim, HK", "Holmes, SA", "Sherwood, AM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The aim of the present study was to search for further evidence of hyperexcitability in the hemisphere contralateral to the affected limb in patients with CRPS by employing both psychophysical and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methods. Twelve patients with CRPS type I, confined to the distal part of a limb (six in an upper-limb and six in a lower-limb), were enrolled in the study. The quantitative thermal, mechanical and 'wind-up' like pain testing was performed at the most painful site in the affected limb and in the ipsilateral limb. Results were then compared to those found at mirror sites in the contralateral limbs. TMS was used to assess the inter-hemispheric difference in parameters of corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition, and intracortical facilitation. The quantitative thermal and mechanical testing showed significant differences in cold, heat and mechanical pain thresholds, as well as in the first and last 'wind-up' stimuli between the affected and the contralateral limbs of the CRPS patients. No significant differences between the ipsilateral unaffected limbs and their contralateral pair limbs were found. A significant reduction in the short intracortical inhibition associated with a significant increase of the I-wave facilitation was found in the hemisphere contralateral to the affected side in the upper-limb CRPS group. No significant inter-hemispheric asymmetry between the affected and the non-affected sides was revealed in the lower-limb CRPS group. Taken together, these results suggest that in patients with well-localized CRPS, there is evidence for sensory and motor CNS hyperexcitability, though it seems to involve only corresponding regions within the CNS rather than the entire hemisphere.", "pages": "2309-15"}, {"volume": "563", "title": "Hyperthermia: a failure of the motor cortex and the muscle.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "15616810", "authors": ["Todd, G", "Butler, JE", "Taylor, JL", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the excitability of corticomotor projections to forearm muscles exhibit phasic modulation during passive movement (flexion-extension) about the wrist joint. We examined the stimulus-response properties of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the contralateral motor cortex while the wrist was moved passively at two different sinusoidal frequency-amplitude relationships. Movement velocity (and therefore, the rate of change in muscle length) at the time of stimulation was held constant. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were facilitated during passive muscle shortening and suppressed during passive muscle lengthening with suppression being more evident at higher stimulation intensities. For both FCR and ECR, during the shortening phase, responses were facilitated during the large amplitude movement relative to the small amplitude movement.
