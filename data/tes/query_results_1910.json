Cognitive brain research", "abstract": "In order to clarify the respective contribution of the right and left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to number comparison, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to disrupt PPC processing in subjects instructed to determine whether a digit was smaller or larger than 5. Single pulse TMS was applied over the PPC, either unilaterally or bilaterally, 150, 200, or 250 ms after digit presentation. Sham TMS was used as a control condition to take into account the unspecific effects of TMS on reaction time (RT). The main finding of the present study is a significant increase in RTs when comparing digits close to 5 following a disruption either of the left PPC alone or of both PPC simultaneously. The comparison of digits far from 5 was unaltered by disrupting only one PPC but RTs were found increased after bilateral PPC stimulation. These disruptive effects were observed irrespective of the TMS delay. We concluded that coding precise numerical values requires the integrity of the left PPC, as suggested by the deficit in discriminating close digits consequent to its disruption. In contrast, approximate comparisons can be processed either by the left or right PPC, since simultaneous bilateral TMS was needed to alter the comparison of digits far from 5.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "568", "title": "Modulating parameters of excitability during and after transcranial direct current stimulation of the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "16002441", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Seeber, A", "Frommann, K", "Klein, CC", "Rochford, C", "Nitsche, MS", "Fricke, K", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W", "Tergau, F"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex results in excitability shifts which occur during and after stimulation. These excitability shifts are polarity-specific with anodal tDCS enhancing excitability, and cathodal reducing it. To explore the origin of this excitability modulation in more detail, we measured the input-output curve and motor thresholds as global parameters of cortico-spinal excitability, and determined intracortical inhibition and facilitation, as well as facilitatory indirect wave (I-wave) interactions. Measurements were performed during short-term tDCS, which elicits no after-effects, and during other tDCS protocols which do elicit short- and long-lasting after-effects. Resting and active motor thresholds remained stable during and after tDCS. The slope of the input-output curve was increased by anodal tDCS and decreased by cathodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex reduced intracortical inhibition and enhanced facilitation after tDCS but not during tDCS. Cathodal tDCS reduced facilitation during, and additionally increased inhibition after its administration. During tDCS, I-wave facilitation was not influenced but, for the after-effects, anodal tDCS increased I-wave facilitation, while cathodal tDCS had only minor effects. These results suggest that the effect of tDCS on cortico-spinal excitability during a short period of stimulation (which does not induce after-effects) primarily depends on subthreshold resting membrane potential changes, which are able to modulate the input-output curve, but not motor thresholds. In contrast, the after-effects of tDCS are due to shifts in intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and at least partly also to facilitatory I-wave interaction, which is controlled by synaptic activity.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "BOLD MRI responses to repetitive TMS over human dorsal premotor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12436087", "authors": ["Bestmann, S", "Baudewig, J", "Siebner, HR", "Rothwell, JC", "Frahm, J"], "year": "2005", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have hitherto failed to demonstrate activity changes in the direct vicinity of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that cannot be attributed to re-afferent somatosensory feedback or a spread of excitation. In order to investigate the underlying activity changes at the site of stimulation as well as in remote connected regions, we applied short trains of high-intensity (110% of resting motor threshold) and low-intensity (90% of active motor threshold) repetitive TMS (rTMS; 3 Hz, 10 s duration) over the presumed location of the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during fMRI. Signal increases in the direct vicinity of the stimulated PMd were observed during rTMS at 110% RMT. However, positive BOLD MRI responses were observed with rTMS at both 90% and 110% RMT in connected brain regions such as right PMd, bilateral PMv, supplementary motor area, somatosensory cortex, cingulate motor area, left posterior temporal lobe, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus. Responses were generally smaller during low-intensity rTMS. The results indicate that short trains of TMS can modify local hemodynamics in the absence of overt motor responses. In addition, premotor rTMS cannot only effectively stimulate cortico-cortical but also cortico-subcortical connections even at low stimulation intensities.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Increases in corticospinal tract function by treadmill training after incomplete spinal cord injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "9818853", "authors": ["Thomas, SL", "Gorassini, MA"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "In this study, we examined if several months of intensive locomotor training increases the function of spared corticospinal tract pathways after chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) in association with the recovery of locomotor function. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at incrementing levels of intensity was applied over the motor cortex supplying either the tibialis anterior or vastus lateralis muscles, and the resulting peak-to-peak amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured to obtain a recruitment curve both before and after training. In the majority of subjects (7/8), 3-5 mo of daily intensive training increased the responses to TMS in at least one of the leg muscles tested (9/13). On average, across all muscles tested MEP(max), which was evoked at high stimulation intensities, increased by 46% and MEP(h), which was evoked at intermediate stimulation intensities, increased by 45% (both significantly different from 0), indicating an increase in corticospinal tract connectivity from training. The slope of the sigmoid function fit to the recruitment curve increased by 24% after training (significantly different), indicating an expansion and/or increased excitability of corticospinal circuits supplying muscles to the lower leg. We also observed that the average duration of the silent period measured at MEP(max) increased after training from 130 to 178 ms, suggesting that training had effects on cortical circuits thought to mediate this long-lasting inhibition. The percentage increase in MEP(max) was positively and significantly correlated to the degree of locomotor recovery as assessed by the WISCI II score, the distance a subject could walk in 6 min, and the amplitude of the locomotor EMG activity, suggesting that the corticospinal tract, in part, mediated the functional locomotor recovery produced from training.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "166", "title": "Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of prefrontal cortex enhances working memory.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12686268", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Boggio, PS", "Nitsche, M", "Bermpohl, F", "Antal, A", "Feredoes, E", "Marcolin, MA", "Rigonatti, SP", "Silva, MT", "Paulus, W", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Our aim was to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, which enhances brain cortical excitability and activity, would modify performance in a sequential-letter working memory task when administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fifteen subjects underwent a three-back working memory task based on letters. This task was performed during sham and anodal stimulation applied over the left DLPFC. Moreover seven of these subjects performed the same task, but with inverse polarity (cathodal stimulation of the left DLPFC) and anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1). Our results indicate that only anodal stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex, but not cathodal stimulation of left DLPFC or anodal stimulation of M1, increases the accuracy of the task performance when compared to sham stimulation of the same area. This accuracy enhancement during active stimulation cannot be accounted for by slowed responses, as response times were not changed by stimulation. Our results indicate that left prefrontal anodal stimulation leads to an enhancement of working memory performance. Furthermore, this effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation. This result may be helpful to develop future interventions aiming at clinical benefits.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Multimodal electrophysiologic follow-up study in 3 mutated but presymptomatic members of a spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) family.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12949224", "authors": ["Ragno, M", "Perretti, AC", "Castaldo, I", "Scarcella, M", "Acciarri, S", "Manganelli, F", "Santoro, L"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The objective was to determine the progression of nervous system involvement in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1).

A clinical and electrophysiologic 7-9 year follow-up was performed. The Inherited Ataxia Progression Scale was used for clinical staging. Sensory and motor conduction velocities, somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial magnetic stimulation were performed at least three times in each subject. Clinical examination showed the early corticospinal pathway involvement. Electrophysiologic investigations confirmed that at the asymptomatic stage only magnetic motor cortex stimulation was abnormal and rapidly worsened with time. Somatosensory pathway studies showed a later involvement and a light sensory-motor neuropathy was the last electrophysiologic abnormality to be recognised. These data confirm that SCA1 phenotype is characterised by early and prevalent pyramidal tract involvement and that peripheral neuropathy is a late and moderate complication.", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "83", "title": "Antiepileptic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with cortical malformations: an EEG and clinical study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "14244793", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Thome-Souza, S", "Bermpohl, F", "Marcolin, MA", "Herzog, A", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Valente, KD"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "To study the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on epileptic EEG discharges in patients with refractory epilepsy and malformations of cortical development (MCDs).", "pages": "283-90"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Localized transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials for monitoring cranial nerves in cranial base surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1 Suppl", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Akagami, R", "Dong, CC", "Westerberg, BD"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Eight patients with MCD and refractory epilepsy underwent 1 session of low-frequency rTMS (0.5 Hz, 600 pulses) focally targeting the MCD.
