Many different stimulation targets and methods have been investigated. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is now approved for the treatment of refractory epilepsies by several governmental authorities in Europe and North America. However, it is mainly used as a palliative method when patients do not respond to medical treatment and epilepsy surgery is not possible. Numerous studies of the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on epileptic seizures have been performed and almost invariably report remarkable success. However, a limited number of controlled studies failed to show a significant effect. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) also was effective in open studies, and controlled studies are now being carried out. In addition, several uncontrolled reports describe successful treatment of refractory status epilepticus with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In summary, with the targets and stimulation parameters investigated so far, the effects of electrical brain stimulation on seizure frequency have been moderate at best. In the animal laboratory, we are now testing high-intensity, low-frequency stimulation of white matter tracts directly connected to the epileptogenic zone (e.g., fornix, corpus callosum) as a new methodology to increase the efficacy of DBS (\"overdrive method\").", "pages": "664-76"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "The role of parietal cortex in awareness of self-generated movements: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "12902395", "authors": ["MacDonald, PA", "Paus, T"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Awareness of self-generated movements arises from comparing motor plans, and the accompanying (hypothetical) efference copy, with the visual and proprioceptive consequences of movement. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate the role of a posterior region in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in this process. Nine healthy volunteers performed a finger extension actively and passively while wearing a CyberGlove; the glove recorded these (actual) finger movements and used this information in real time to move a virtual hand displayed on a computer screen. To assess the participant's awareness of movement onset, we introduced a delay between the onset of the actual and virtual movement (60-270 ms, 30 ms increments); the task was to judge whether the virtual hand movements were delayed relative to the actual hand movements. Low-frequency rTMS (15 min, 0.6 Hz) was applied either over the left SPL or the left temporal cortex (control site) to decrease excitability of these regions and, in turn, test their role in the awareness of self-generated movement. Following the SPL stimulation, participants' assessments of asynchrony were impaired for active but not passive movements. No significant changes were observed after rTMS applied over the control site. We suggest that these findings are consistent with the role of the SPL in evaluating the temporal congruency of peripheral (visual) and central (efference copy) signals associated with self-generated movements. As such, this region may contribute to the sense of 'agency' and its disturbances in disorders such as apraxia and schizophrenia.", "pages": "664-76"}, {"volume": "348", "title": "Combination of 5 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and tactile coactivation boosts tactile discrimination in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12902029", "authors": ["Ragert, P", "Dinse, HR", "Pleger, B", "Wilimzig, C", "Frombach, E", "Schwenkreis, P", "Tegenthoff, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "A combination of 5 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left primary somatosensory cortex together with tactile coactivation applied to the right index-finger representation (coac + rTMS) boosted tactile discrimination ability tested on the right index-finger. Applying coactivation alone caused a 0.25 mm lowering in tactile discrimination thresholds. In contrast, after coac + rTMS we found a significant further improvement of discrimination thresholds in comparison to the coactivation-induced perceptual changes alone. We demonstrate that the individual further improvement after coac + rTMS depended on the effectiveness of the coactivation protocol when applied alone. Subjects, who showed little gain in tactile performance after coactivation alone, showed the largest improvement after coac + rTMS implying that the combined application was selective for poor learners. The selective effects of coac + rTMS are discussed in respect to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation.", "pages": "664-76"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "New developments in electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "12894034", "authors": ["Lisanby, SH", "Morales, O", "Payne, N", "Kwon, E", "Fitzsimons, L", "Luber, B", "Nobler, MS", "Sackeim, HA"], "year": "2003", "journal": "CNS spectrums", "abstract": "New findings regarding the mechanisms of action of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) have led to novel developments in treatment technique to further improve this highly effective treatment for major depression. These new approaches include novel placements, optimization of electrical stimulus parameters, and new methods for inducing more targeted seizures(eg, magnetic seizure therapy [MST]). MST is the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce a seizure. Magnetic fields pass through tissue unimpeded, providing more control over the site and extent of stimulation than can be achieved with ECT. This enhanced control represents a means of focusing the treatment on target cortical structures thought to be essential to antidepressant response and reducing spread to medial temporal regions implicated in the cognitive side effects of ECT. MST is at an early stage of development. Preliminary results suggest that MST may have some advantages over ECT in terms of subjective side effects and acute cognitive functioning. Studies designed to address the antidepressant efficacy of MST are underway. As with all attempts to improve convulsive therapy technique, the clinical value of MST will need to be established through controlled clinical trials. This article reviews the experience to date with MST, and places this work in the broader context of other means of optimizing convulsive therapy in the treatment of depression.", "pages": "664-76"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Putative common pathways in therapeutic brain stimulation for affective disorders.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "12894030", "authors": ["Bolwig, TG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "CNS spectrums", "abstract": "Brain stimulation methods in the treatment of affective disorder are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Clinically, ECT is considered the strongest remedy in the treatment of severe depression, especially depression with psychotic features, and in the elderly. TMS, despite positive reports, is somewhat more controversial. VNS has, so far, only been used in treatment-resistant depression with limited results. DBS may be of potential use in rare cases of treatment-resistant cases of affective disorder. This article highlights the similarities and differences between the four stimulation methods. The main difference is the seizures necessary in ECT. A stronger involvement of the hippocampus following experimental seizures compared with effects in that region induced by TMS and VNS might explain the consistent findings of the superiority of ECT in the most severe cases of affective disorder.", "pages": "664-76"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the parietal cortex transiently ameliorates phantom limb pain-like syndrome.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "12888036", "authors": ["T\u00f6pper, R", "Foltys, H", "Meister, IG", "Sparing, R", "Boroojerdi, B"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Phantom pain is linked to a reorganization of the partially deafferented sensory cortex.
