To further analyze its role and to assess whether it has a lateralized influence, in the present study we used a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interference approach in a group of normal subjects performing a serial reaction time task. We studied 36 normal volunteers: 13 subjects underwent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the left cerebellum and performed the task with the right (6 subjects) or left (7 subjects) hand; 10 subjects underwent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the right cerebellum and performed the task with the hand ipsilateral (5 subjects) or contralateral (5 subjects) to the stimulation; another 13 subjects served as controls and were not submitted to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; 7 of them performed the task with the right hand and 6 with the left hand. The main results show that interference with the activity of the lateral cerebellum induces a significant decrease of procedural learning: Interference with the right cerebellar hemisphere activity induces a significant decrease in procedural learning regardless of the hand used to perform the serial reaction time task, whereas left cerebellar hemisphere activity seems more linked with procedural learning through the ipsilateral hand. In conclusion, the present study shows for the first time that a transient interference with the functions of the cerebellar cortex results in an impairment of procedural learning in normal subjects and it provides new evidences for interhemispheric differences in the lateral cerebellum.", "pages": "1605-11"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Giovanni Aldini: from animal electricity to human brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15595271", "authors": ["Parent, A"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Canadian journal of neurological sciences. Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques", "abstract": "Two hundred years ago, Giovanni Aldini published a highly influential book that reported experiments in which the principles of Luigi Galvani (animal electricity) and Alessandro Volta (bimetallic electricity) were used together for the first time. Aldini was born in Bologna in 1762 and graduated in physics at the University of his native town in 1782. As nephew and assistant of Galvani, he actively participated in a series of crucial experiments with frog's muscles that led to the idea that electricity was the long-sought vital force coursing from brain to muscles. Aldini became professor of experimental physics at the University of Bologna in 1798. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, spending much time defending the concept of his discreet uncle against the incessant attacks of Volta, who did not believe in animal electricity. Aldini used Volta's bimetallic pile to apply electric current to dismembered bodies of animals and humans; these spectacular galvanic reanimation experiments made a strong and enduring impression on his contemporaries. Aldini also treated patients with personality disorders and reported complete rehabilitation following transcranial administration of electric current. Aldini's work laid the ground for the development of various forms of electrotherapy that were heavily used later in the 19th century. Even today, deep brain stimulation, a procedure currently employed to relieve patients with motor or behavioral disorders, owes much to Aldini and galvanism. In recognition of his merits, Aldini was made a knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of state at Milan, where he died in 1834.", "pages": "1605-11"}, {"volume": "251", "title": "Optimising the detection of upper motor neuron function dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis--a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "15592732", "authors": ["Osei-Lah, AD", "Mills, KR"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Evidence of upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction is essential in making the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Central motor conduction (CMC) abnormalities detected using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are presumed to reflect UMN dysfunction. CMC is, however, often normal in patients with classical sporadic ALS. The aim of the study was to determine whether the utility of the CMC measure in ALS could be enhanced. We measured CMC to four pairs of muscles (abductor digiti minimi (ADM), biceps, vastus medialis (VM) and abductor hallucis (AH) in 20 controls and 25 ALS patients. The commonest abnormality detected in the ALS patients was an absent MEP, found in 11 patients (44 %) and in 25 of 200 muscles examined. Studying a minimum of three muscles increased the probability of detecting UMN dysfunction. Weakness in the muscle as well as selecting a distal rather than a proximal muscle was significantly associated with an abnormal CMC. Interside differences in CMC were significantly more pronounced in the patient group. In 30% of patients a significant interside difference in AH CMC time was the sole abnormality, suggesting mild UMN dysfunction on the side with the longer CMC.", "pages": "1605-11"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in lower motor neuron diseases.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15589181", "authors": ["Attarian, S", "Azulay, JP", "Lardillier, D", "Verschueren, A", "Pouget, J"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To study the diagnostic value of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a group of patients with lower motor neuron disease (LMND).

Patients with pure motor neuropathy had normal SP and amplitude ratio. Four out of 14 patients had increased central motor conduction time (CMCT), one had increased CMCT and excitatory threshold, and one patient had a slightly increased excitatory threshold. Considering the abnormality of TMS variables in the groups, SP, excitatory threshold, and amplitude ratio were chosen in a post-hoc attempt to select variables yielding high sensitivity and specificity. The overall sensitivity of TMS for diagnosis of ALS among LMND was 85.7%, its specificity was 93.9%. When only the abnormality of SP was taken into account, the sensitivity was unchanged.

Here we recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right first dorsal interosseus muscle to investigate how sub-threshold high-frequency rTMS to the M1-HAND modulates cortical and spinal excitability. In a first experiment, we gave 1500 stimuli of 5 Hz rTMS. At an intensity of 90% of active motor threshold, rTMS produced no effect on MEP amplitude at rest. Increasing the intensity to 90% of resting motor threshold (RMT), rTMS produced an increase in MEP amplitude. This facilitatory effect gradually built up during the course of rTMS, reaching significance after the administration of 900 stimuli. In a second experiment, MEPs were elicited during tonic contraction using weak anodal electrical or magnetic test stimuli. 1500 (but not 600) conditioning stimuli at 90% of RMT induced a facilitation of MEPs in the contracting FDI muscle. In a third experiment, 600 conditioning stimuli were given at 90% of RMT to the M1-HAND. Using two well-established conditioning-test paradigms, we found a decrease in short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), and a facilitation of the first peak of facilitatory I-waves interaction (SICF). There was no correlation between the relative changes in SICI and SICF. These results demonstrate that subthreshold 5 Hz rTMS can induce lasting changes in specific neuronal subpopulations in the human corticospinal motor system, depending on the intensity and duration of rTMS. Short 5 Hz rTMS (600 stimuli) at 90% of RMT can selectively shape the excitability of distinct intracortical circuits, whereas prolonged 5 Hz rTMS (> or =900 stimuli) provokes an overall increase in excitability of the corticospinal output system, including spinal motoneurones.", "pages": "1605-11"}, {"volume": "160", "title": "Excitability of the motor cortical representation of the external anal sphincter.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15565435", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test the postulate that perceptual learning of a visual task initially performed at 60-65% accuracy strengthens visual processing in early visual cortex. Single pulse TMS was delivered to human occipital cortex at time delays of 70-154 ms after the onset of an odd-element, line orientation discrimination task. When TMS was delivered at a delay of 84 ms or later the accuracy of visual discrimination was transiently degraded in ten subjects. As visual performance in control trials without TMS improved with training, the absolute magnitude of TMS suppression of performance decreased in parallel. This result occurred both when TMS was delivered to broad areas of occipital cortex and when TMS was optimally delivered to early occipital cortex. No change in TMS suppression was observed when three new subjects were given feedback during an odd-element task that did not require substantial perceptual learning. Thus, perceptual learning improved visual performance and reduced TMS suppression of early visual cortex in parallel.", "pages": "1605-11"}]
