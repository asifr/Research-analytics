Here we use magnetic resonance spectroscopy to define mechanisms mediating this inhibition by noninvasively measuring local changes in the cortical concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate/glutamine (Glx). cTBS to the left M1 led to an increase in GABA compared with stimulation at a control site without significant change in Glx. This direct evidence for increased GABAergic interneuronal activity is framed in terms of a new hypothesis regarding mechanisms underlying cTBS.", "pages": "2872-7"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Near space functioning of the human angular and supramarginal gyri.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "10611637", "authors": ["Bjoertomt, O", "Cowey, A", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neuropsychology", "abstract": "The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been associated with the encoding of events in peripersonal space, but little is known about the precise segregation of parietal areas involved specifically in 'near-space' visuospatial processing. This study applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to two parietal areas: the right angular gyrus (ANG) and the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in addition to a control site, cortical visual area V5, while subjects performed symmetry judgements on lines presented simultaneously in the left and right visual fields. Eight subjects performed the task with the stimuli presented either in peripersonal or extra personal space. As expected, TMS over the right ANG caused subjects to report lines as being longer ipsilateral to the stimulation site, but only in near space. TMS of the right SMG, however, induced a bias shift in both near and far space, but the change only reached significance in near space. Our findings suggest that, consistent with its role in somatosensory functions, the SMG, like the ANG, is specialised for near space.", "pages": "2872-7"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "Vibration prolongs the cortical silent period in an antagonistic muscle.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "16221751", "authors": ["Binder, C", "Kaya, AE", "Liepert, J"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "We tested whether the silent period, an indicator of inhibitory neuronal activity, is modulated by muscle vibration. Vibration was applied to the right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle in 17 healthy subjects and, as a control experiment, to the dorsal terminal phalanges in 5 subjects. Data before vibration were compared with those during vibration. The cortical silent period (CSP) was evoked by transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) during voluntary wrist flexion or during voluntary wrist extension. TMS-evoked motor potentials (MEPs) of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle were recorded during muscle relaxation. The mixed nerve silent period (MNSP) was obtained by electrical stimulation of the median nerve during wrist flexion. ECR vibration induced a significant prolongation of the CSP in FCR. CSP increases induced by vibration of the dorsal terminal phalanges were significantly less pronounced. In ECR, the CSP tended to be shortened. MEPs and MNSP remained unchanged. We conclude that vibration enhances inhibitory neuronal properties in a non-vibrated antagonistic muscle, presumably at a supraspinal level. These results may be relevant for the treatment of spasticity of the upper extremity.", "pages": "2872-7"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Commentary: physical approaches for the treatment of epilepsy: electrical and magnetic stimulation and cooling.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10802449", "authors": ["L\u00f6scher, W", "Cole, AJ", "McLean, MJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "abstract": "Physical approaches for the treatment of epilepsy currently under study or development include electrical or magnetic brain stimulators and cooling devices, each of which may be implanted or applied externally. Some devices may stimulate peripheral structures, whereas others may be implanted directly into the brain. Stimulation may be delivered chronically, intermittently, or in response to either manual activation or computer-based detection of events of interest. Physical approaches may therefore ultimately be appropriate for seizure prophylaxis by causing a modification of the underlying substrate, presumably with a reduction in the intrinsic excitability of cerebral structures, or for seizure termination, by interfering with the spontaneous discharge of pathological neuronal networks. Clinical trials of device-based therapies are difficult due to ethical issues surrounding device implantation, problems with blinding, potential carryover effects that may occur in crossover designs if substrate modification occurs, and subject heterogeneity. Unresolved issues in the development of physical treatments include optimization of stimulation parameters, identification of the optimal volume of brain to be stimulated, development of adequate power supplies to stimulate the necessary areas, and a determination that stimulation itself does not promote epileptogenesis or adverse long-term effects on normal brain function.", "pages": "2872-7"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation protocols in the treatment of epilepsy: current state and perspectives.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10985677", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "abstract": "In epileptic seizures, there is an enhanced probability of neuronal networks to fire synchronously at high frequency, initiated by a paroxysmal depolarisation shift. Reducing neuronal excitability is a common target of antiepileptic therapies. Beyond or in addition to pharmacological interventions, excitability-reducing brain stimulation is pursued as an alternative therapeutic approach. Hereby, noninvasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have gained increased interest as efficient tools to modulate cortical excitability and activity. In animal models, stimulation-induced cortical excitability diminution has been shown to be suited to reduce seizures. Clinical studies conducted to date, however, have shown mixed results.
