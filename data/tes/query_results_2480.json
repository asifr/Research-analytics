We first altered motor excitability by applying low-frequency repetitive TMS over two cortical motor regions in separate experiments: the dorsal premotor and primary motor cortices. We then assessed the consequences of modulating motor excitability by applying single-pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex and measuring: 1) muscle responses with electromyography and 2) cerebral blood flow with PET. Low-frequency repetitive stimulation reduced muscle responses to a similar degree in both experiments. To map networks of brain regions in which activity changes reflected modulation of motor excitability, we generated t-statistical maps of correlations between reductions in muscle response and differences in cerebral blood flow. Low-frequency repetitive stimulation altered neural activity differently in both experiments. Neural modulation occurred in multiple brain regions after dorsal premotor cortex stimulation; these included motor regions in the frontal cortex as well as more associational regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices. In contrast, neural modulation occurred in a smaller number of brain regions after primary motor cortex stimulation, many of these confined to the motor system. These findings are consistent with the known differences between the dorsal premotor and primary motor cortices in the extent of cortico-cortical anatomical connectivity in the monkey.", "pages": "450-7"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Magnetic stimulation of motor and somatosensory cortices suppresses perception of ulnar nerve stimuli.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11214267", "authors": ["McKay, DR", "Ridding, MC", "Miles, TS"], "year": "2003", "journal": "International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology", "abstract": "The stimulation of nerve or cortical tissue by magnetic induction is a relatively new tool for the non-invasive study of the brain and nervous system.

Since tissue is conductive, particle motion created by an ultrasonic wave will induce an electric current density generated by Lorentz forces. An analytical derivation is given for the electric field distribution induced by a collimated ultrasonic beam. An example shows that peak electric fields of up to 8 V/m appear to be achievable at the upper range of diagnostic intensities. This field strength is about an order of magnitude lower than fields typically associated with TMS; however, the electric field gradients induced by ultrasound can be quite high (about 60 kV/m2 at 4 MHz), which theoretically play a more important role in activation than the field magnitude.

Lack of habituation is the principal and most reproducible interictal abnormality in sensory processing in migraineurs. It is found in evoked potential (EP) studies for every stimulation modality including nociceptive stimuli, and it is likely to be responsible for the increased intensity dependence of EP. We have hypothesized that deficient EP habituation in migraine could be due to a reduced preactivation level of sensory cortices because of hypofunctioning subcortico-cortical aminergic pathways. This is not in keeping with simple hyperexcitability of the cortex, which has been suggested by some, but not all, studies of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A recent study of the effects of repetitive TMS on visual EP strongly supports the hypothesis that migraine is characterized by interictal cortical hypoexcitability. With regard to pain mechanisms in migraine, electrophysiological studies of trigeminal pathways using nociceptive blink and corneal reflexes have confirmed that sensitization of central trigeminal nociceptors occurs during migraine attacks.", "pages": "450-7"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Abnormal cutaneomotor integration in patients with cerebellar syndromes: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "1705219", "authors": ["Tamburin, S", "Fiaschi, A", "Andreoli, A", "Forgione, A", "Manganotti, P", "Zanette, G"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become a major research tool in experimental clinical neurophysiology as a result of its potential to noninvasively and focally stimulate cortical brain regions. Currently, studies are being conducted to investigate whether repetitive TMS (rTMS)-mediated modulation of cortical function may also provide a therapeutic approach in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Preclinical findings have shown that prefrontal rTMS can modulate the function of fronto-limbic circuits, which is reversibly altered in major depression. rTMS has also been found to exert effects on neurotransmitter systems involved in the pathophysiology of major depression (e.g. stimulates subcortical dopamine release and acts on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, which is dysregulated in depression). To date, numerous open and controlled clinical trials with widely differing stimulation parameters have explored the antidepressant potential of rTMS. Though conducted with small sample sizes, the majority of the controlled trials demonstrated significant antidepressant effects of active rTMS compared with a sham condition. Effect sizes, however, varied from modest to substantial, and the patient selection focused on therapy-resistant cases. Moreover, the average treatment duration was approximately 2 weeks, which is short compared with other antidepressant interventions. Larger multicentre trials, which would be mandatory to demonstrate the antidepressant effectiveness of rTMS, have not been conducted to date.A putative future application of rTMS may be the treatment of patients who did not tolerate or did not respond to antidepressant pharmacotherapy before trying more invasive strategies such as electroconvulsive therapy and vagus nerve stimulation. Theoretically, rTMS may be also applied early in the course of disease in order to speed up and increase the effects of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. However, this application has not been a focus of clinical trials to date. Research efforts should be intensified to further investigate the effectiveness of rTMS as an antidepressant intervention and to test specific applications of the technique in the treatment of depressive episodes.", "pages": "450-7"}]
