The ability of the primary motor cortex (M1) to modulate motor responses in ipsilateral hand muscles seems to be important for normal motor control and potentially also for recovery after brain lesions. It is not clear which pathways mediate this ipsilateral modulation. Transcallosal connections have been proposed, but are known to be sparse between cortical hand motor representations in primates. The present study was performed to determine whether descending ipsilateral modulation of motor responses might also be mediated below the cortical level in humans. 2. A paired-pulse protocol was used, in which motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were produced by cortical transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS) or by electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract at the level of the pyramidal decussation (pdTES), in both preactivated and relaxed hand muscles. Paired stimuli were applied at various interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between 2 and 100 ms. The conditioning stimulus (CS) was always magnetic, and delivered to the M1 ipsilateral to the target hand, prior to the test stimulus (TS). The magnetic TS was delivered to the M1 contralateral to the target hand; the electrical TS was applied through electrodes placed over the mastoid process bilaterally. Further experiments included cortical electrical stimulation and H-reflexes. The MEP amplitudes were averaged separately for each ISI and the control condition (no CS), and expressed as a percentage of the unconditioned response. 3. Conditioning stimulation of the ipsilateral M1 resulted in significant inhibition of magnetically evoked MEPs, and also of MEPs produced by pdTES. Inhibition occurred at ISIs between 6 and 50 ms, and was observed in preactivated and relaxed muscles. Higher CS intensities caused greater inhibition of both cTMS- and pdTES-evoked MEPs. 4. While the conditioning effects on magnetically evoked muscle responses could be explained by a transcallosal mechanism, the effects on pdTES-evoked MEPs cannot, because they are elicited subcortically and are therefore not susceptible to inhibitory mechanisms transmitted at the cortico-cortical level. 5. In conclusion, the present results provide novel evidence that the inhibitory influence of the human M1 on ipsilateral hand muscles is to a significant extent mediated below the cortical level, and not only through cortico-cortical transcallosal connections. They point to a concept of inhibitory interaction between the two primary motor cortices that is relayed at multiple levels along the neuroaxis, thus perhaps providing a structurally redundant system which may become important in case of lesions.", "pages": "241-50"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Transcranial AC pulsed applications of weak electromagnetic fields reduces freezing and falling in progressive supranuclear palsy: a case report.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "9273860", "authors": ["Sandyk, R"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The International journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Freezing is a common and disabling symptom in patients with Parkinsonism. It affects most commonly the gait in the form of start hesitation and sudden immobility often resulting in falling. A higher incidence of freezing occurs in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) which is characterized clinically by a constellation of symptoms including supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, postural instability, axial rigidity, dysarthria, Parkinsonism, and pseudobulbar palsy. Pharmacologic therapy of PSP is currently disappointing and the disease progresses relentlessly to a fatal outcome within the first decade after onset. This report concerns a 67 year old woman with a diagnosis of PSP in whom freezing and frequent falling were the most disabling symptoms of the disease at the time of presentation. Both symptoms, which were rated 4 on the Unified Parkinson Rating Scale (UPRS) which grades Parkinsonian symptoms and signs from 0 to 4, with 0 being normal and 4 being severe symptoms, were resistant to treatment with dopaminergic drugs such as levodopa, amantadine, selegiline and pergolide mesylate as well as with the potent and highly selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor nortriptyline. Weekly transcranial applications of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of picotesla flux density was associated with approximately 50% reduction in the frequency of freezing and about 80-90% reduction in frequency of falling after a 6 months follow-up period. At this point freezing was rated 2 while falling received a score of 1 on the UPRS. In addition, this treatment was associated with an improvement in Parkinsonian and pseudobulbar symptoms with the difference between the pre-and post EMF treatment across 13 measures being highly significant (p < .005; Sign test). These results suggest that transcranial administration AC pulsed EMFs in the picotesla flux density is efficacious in the treatment of PSP.", "pages": "241-50"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "[The use of transcranial electrostimulation for pain relief in cancer patients].", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8994119", "authors": ["Evtiukhin, AI", "Dunaevski\u012d, IV", "Shabut, AM", "Aleksandrov, VA"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Voprosy onkologii", "abstract": "The report discusses whether transcranial electrostimulation in cancer patients can be accepted.

Evidence was sought to support the suggestion that corticospinal input can be relayed to motoneurones (MNs) via a population of interneurones (premotoneurones) in the cervical cord, and that this pathway operates in parallel with the direct monosynaptic pathway. 2. Single motor units were recorded in forearm muscles and post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of their firing pattern were constructed during voluntary activation. Weak transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex was used to produce a small facilitation in the PSTH. We then examined how the size of this peak was affected by low threshold electrical stimulation of either the homonymous muscle nerve or the musculo-cutaneous nerve at various interstimulus intervals (ISIs). 3. Homonymous nerve stimulation had the following characteristics: (a) the cortical peak was facilitated when stimuli were timed so that both inputs arrived simultaneously at the MN; (b) the amount of facilitation was only slightly greater than the sum of the effects of each stimulus given alone; and (c) facilitation affected even the earliest bins of the cortically evoked peak. These three features are consistent with a monosynaptic input onto the MN from both sources. 4. Stimulation of the musculo-cutaneous nerve (which has no monosynaptic connections with forearm MNs) had no effect at similar timings. It (a) produced facilitation only at longer intervals corresponding to an extra central delay of 4-6 ms; (b) always gave a significantly larger facilitation than expected from the algebraic sum of the effects of each stimulus given alone; and (c) never affected the earliest bins of the cortical peak. These features are compatible with interaction of peripheral and cortical inputs at a population of premotoneurones. 5. These results confirm the suggestion that premotoneurones mediate part of the cortical command to MNs innervating forearm muscles. 6. Excitation is followed by an inhibition which may almost completely suppress the cortical peak. It is suggested that cortical and musculo-cutaneous volleys also converge onto inhibitory interneurones projecting to the premotoneuronal pool.", "pages": "241-50"}, {"volume": "508 ( Pt 2)", "title": "Effects of voluntary contraction on descending volleys evoked by transcranial stimulation in conscious humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9009990", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Restuccia, D", "Oliviero, A", "Profice, P", "Ferrara, L", "Insola, A", "Mazzone, P", "Tonali, P", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. The spinal volleys evoked by single transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation over the cerebral motor cortex were recorded from a bipolar electrode inserted into the cervical epidural space of three conscious human subjects. These volleys were termed direct (D) and indirect (I) waves according to their latency. 2. We measured the size and number of volleys elicited by magnetic stimulation at various intensities with subjects at rest and during 20 or 100 % maximum contraction of the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). Surface EMG activity was also recorded. 3. Electrical stimulation evoked a D-wave volley. Magnetic stimulation at intensities up to about 15 % of stimulator output above threshold evoked only I-waves. At higher intensities, a D-wave could be seen in two of the three subjects. 4. At all intensities tested, voluntary contraction increased the number and size of the I-waves, particularly during maximum contractions. However, there was only a small effect on the threshold for evoking descending activity. Voluntary contraction produced large changes in the size of EMG responses recorded from FDI. 5. Because the recorded epidural activity is destined for muscles other than the FDI, it is impossible to say to what extent increased activity contributes to voluntary facilitation of EMG responses. Indeed, our results suggest that the main factor responsible for enhancing EMG responses in the transition from rest to activity is likely to be increased excitability of spinal motoneurones, rather than increases in the corticospinal volley. The latter may be more important in producing EMG facilitation at different levels of voluntary contraction.", "pages": "241-50"}]
