We investigated whether the long-lasting rTMS effect on motor behavior can be modulated by subsequent engagement of the contralateral sensorimotor system. Motor task was performed in different experimental conditions: immediately after rTMS, 30 min after rTMS, or when real rTMS was substituted with sham rTMS. Subjects performing the motor task immediately after rTMS showed modifications in motor behavior < or =30 min after rTMS. On the other hand, when real rTMS was substituted with sham stimulation or when subjects performed the motor task 30 min after the rTMS session, the effect was no longer present. These findings suggest that the combination of ipsilateral 1Hz-rTMS and voluntary movement is crucial to endure the effect of rTMS on the movement itself, probably acting on synaptic plasticity-like mechanism. This finding might provide some useful hints for neurorehabilitation protocols.", "pages": "1690-4"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Changes in corticospinal excitability and the direction of evoked movements during motor preparation: a TMS study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "18559096", "authors": ["van Elswijk, G", "Schot, WD", "Stegeman, DF", "Overeem, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "BMC neuroscience", "abstract": "Preparation of the direction of a forthcoming movement has a particularly strong influence on both reaction times and neuronal activity in the primate motor cortex. Here, we aimed to find direct neurophysiologic evidence for the preparation of movement direction in humans. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evoke isolated thumb-movements, of which the direction can be modulated experimentally, for example by training or by motor tasks. Sixteen healthy subjects performed brisk concentric voluntary thumb movements during a reaction time task in which the required movement direction was precued. We assessed whether preparation for the thumb movement lead to changes in the direction of TMS-evoked movements and to changes in amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the hand muscles.", "pages": "1690-4"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Monitoring of nerve root injury using transcranial motor-evoked potentials in a pig model.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "10030680", "authors": ["Mok, JM", "Lyon, R", "Lieberman, JA", "Cloyd, JM", "Burch, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "When the required movement direction was precued early in the preparatory interval, reaction times were 50 ms faster than when precued at the end of the preparatory interval. Over time, the direction of the TMS-evoked thumb movements became increasingly variable, but it did not turn towards the precued direction. MEPs from the thumb muscle (agonist) were differentially modulated by the direction of the precue, but only in the late phase of the preparatory interval and thereafter. MEPs from the index finger muscle did not depend on the precued direction and progressively decreased during the preparatory interval.", "pages": "1690-4"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "High-frequency rTMS over the supplementary motor area for treatment of Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "9928787", "authors": ["Hamada, M", "Ugawa, Y", "Tsuji, S", ""], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Our data show that the human corticospinal movement representation undergoes progressive changes during motor preparation.
