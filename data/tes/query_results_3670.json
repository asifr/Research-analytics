Electrical and magnetic stimuli were applied over the motor areas of the hand and the leg. Surface EMGs were recorded from the antagonistic extensor and flexor carpi radialis and the anterior tibial and triceps surae muscles. Except for the well known early (primary) responses several secondary responses have been recorded. (1) A response with a latency of approximately 100 msec and with higher threshold than the primary response. It was found in approximately half of the muscles recorded from except for the anterior tibial where it was comparatively rare. It could appear both contra- and ipsilaterally and increased in amplitude with preactivation of the target muscle. It is probably not of startle origin but its appearance may be influenced by an approximately simultaneous startle effect from the scalp stimulus. (2) In some subjects a response with a latency of 50-60 msec was recorded. Sometimes it was easily separated from the primary response and from S 100 but sometimes the differentiation was difficult. (3) It was found that the known inhibitory period which follows the primary response was contralateral and increased in duration with increasing stimulus strength. The increase in duration may be due to inhibitory feedback from receptors activated by the simultaneously increasing primary muscle twitch. (4) In relaxed muscle we also observed a contralateral response with a latency exceeding 150 msec. The latency increased with increasing stimulus strength. This increase seems to be related to discontinuance of the inhibitory period.", "pages": "161-72"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve: recording technique and estimation of the stimulated site.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2308677", "authors": ["Seki, Y", "Krain, L", "Yamada, T", "Kimura, J"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "We compared transcranial magnetic and conventional electrical stimulation in 20 facial nerves of 10 normal subjects. A magnetic coil was placed tangentially over T5 or T6 (10-20 electroencephalogram electrode placement system) and electrical stimulation was applied 1 cm below the anterior tragus. Compound muscle action potentials recorded from the ipsilateral nasalis muscle showed onset latencies (mean +/- SD) of 4.48 +/- 0.50 ms with magnetic stimulation and 3.15 +/- 0.40 ms with electrical stimulation, a mean difference of 1.33 +/- 0.14 ms. Stimulation of the extracranial facial nerve at two sites yielded a conduction velocity of 59.6 +/- 4.5 m/s. Based on these findings, the magnetically stimulated site was estimated to fall 79.0 +/- 8.6 mm proximal to the point of electrical stimulation. Taking the average length of the nerve trunk and histological specificity of the root exit zone into consideration, evidence indicates that the root exit zone of the facial nerve is the most likely initiating site of excitation with magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "161-72"}, {"volume": "75", "title": "Estimation of facial central motor delay by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex of the dog.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1688777", "authors": ["Haghighi, SS", "Estrem, SA"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Central delay time (CD) has been estimated for activation of limb muscles by electrical or transcranial magnetic coil (TMC) stimulation of motor cortex and ventral root outflow.

A better understanding of the characteristics of the normal MEP is needed before one can fully appreciate the effects of injury on the MEP. We describe characteristic patterns of spinal cord MEPs, recorded epidurally, in response to transcranial (dura-to-palate) brain stimulation in a rat model. Series of signal averaged MEP responses at a duration of 100 microseconds were recorded at T10/11, T12/13, and L1/2 in 8 normal rats. We used a much greater range of current intensities (0.5-65 mA) than has been studied previously. Also, we studied the gradual development of the MEP wave form using smaller increments of current strength than have been reported previously. We confirmed in rats our earlier report in cats that long latency peaks appear first at low intensities while short latency peaks appear with higher intensities (Konrad et al. 1988). We also report average peak latencies over the range of stimulus intensities used for each recording level in each rat. In some rats, conduction velocities of several MEP peaks were calculated, and they range from 35 to 42 m/sec. These velocities are consistent with values reported in the literature for extrapyramidal pathways. Our rat model provides a method of measuring spinal cord potentials at three levels with no trauma to the spinal cord. Therefore, it can be used to repeatedly test motor function in chronic studies of spinal cord injury.", "pages": "161-72"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Central motor conduction in ischaemic and hemorrhagic cerebral lesions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "2406125", "authors": ["Segura, MJ", "Gandolfo, CN", "Sica, RE"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Electrical Transcranial Cortical Stimulation was performed in 20 healthy volunteers and 14 patients having supra- or infratentorial vascular lesions.

TES for 18-20 min in duration abolished the reactions of high threshold SMRs activated only by nociceptive stimuli. Inhibitory effects of TES on all SMR types under study were eliminated by preliminary intraperitoneal or local intracutaneous (near SMRs location) injection of naloxone.
