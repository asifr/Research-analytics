The facial nerve was stimulated preoperatively and intraoperatively by transcranial magnetic stimulation and intraoperatively by electrical stimulation at its root exit zone with a minimum of surgical invasion of the facial nerves. The onset latency of compound muscle action potentials recorded from the nasalis muscle was 5.06 +/- 0.44 ms by magnetic stimulation and 5.08 +/- 0.43 ms by electrical stimulation. The latency difference was 0.06 +/- 0.08 ms. Therefore, transcranial magnetic stimulation was basically the same as electrical stimulation in onset latency. From this study, it appears that the root exit zone of the facial nerves is stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "414-6; discussion 415-6"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "Determination of current density distributions generated by electrical stimulation of the human cerebral cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "7885571", "authors": ["Nathan, SS", "Sinha, SR", "Gordon, B", "Lesser, RP", "Thakor, NV"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "With the use of a 3-dimensional finite element model of the human brain based on structural data from MRI scans, we simulated patterns of current flow in the cerebral hemisphere with different types of electrical stimulation. Five different tissue types were incorporated into the model based on conductivities taken from the literature. The boundary value problem derived from Laplace's equation was solved with a quasi-static approximation. Transcranial electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes was poorly focussed and required high levels of current for stimulation of the cortex. Direct cortical stimulation with bipolar (adjacent) electrodes was found to be very effective in producing localized current flows. Unipolar cortical stimulation (with a more distant reference electrode) produced higher current densities at the same stimulating current as did bipolar stimulation, but stimulated a larger region of the cortex. With the simulated electrodes resting on the pia-arachnoid, as usually occurs clinically, there was significant shunting of the current (7/8 of the total current) through the CSF. Possible changes in electrodes and stimulation parameters that might improve stimulation procedures are considered.", "pages": "414-6; discussion 415-6"}, {"volume": "116 ( Pt 1)", "title": "Plasticity of the sensorimotor cortex representation of the reading finger in Braille readers.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "7680994", "authors": ["Pascual-Leone, A", "Torres, F"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "We studied the organization of the somatosensory cortex in proficient Braille readers, recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 10 subjects and using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in five subjects, and compared the results with those of 15 control subjects. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited by a focal electrical stimulus to the tip of the index finger and recorded from a contralateral 4 x 4 grid of scalp electrodes centred around C3' and C4'. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, with an 8-shaped coil centred over the same scalp positions, was delivered simultaneously with, and at different intervals after, the finger stimulus. The results of the right index (reading) finger in Braille readers were compared with those of their left index (non-reading) finger and of the right and left index fingers of the control subjects. The scalp areas from which we recorded N20 and P22 components of the SEP with an amplitude of at least 70% of the maximal amplitude recorded in each trial were significantly larger in SEPs evoked from the reading fingers. Detection of the stimulus applied to the reading finger was blocked by TMS delivered over a larger contralateral scalp area and during a longer time window after the stimulus. These experiments suggest that reading Braille is associated with expansion of the sensorimotor cortical representation of the reading finger.", "pages": "414-6; discussion 415-6"}, {"volume": "264", "title": "Swallowing and upper esophageal sphincter contraction with transcranial magnetic-induced electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2 Pt 1", "pmid": "8453464", "authors": ["Valdez, DT", "Salapatek, A", "Niznik, G", "Linden, RD", "Diamant, NE"], "year": "1993", "journal": "The American journal of physiology", "abstract": "This study in three dogs explores the effect of magnetically induced electrical stimulation of the brain to induce swallowing and produce contraction of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). Single stimuli were delivered at intervals from 15 s to 3 min. Studies were performed with and without perfusion of fluid into the pharynx and upper esophagus. Results showed that magnetic stimulation produced a twitch contraction of the UES when stimulus intensity was above a threshold that varied between 14 and 20% of the stimulator output. Increasing stimulus intensity progressively increased twitch amplitude. Magnetic stimulation also induced swallowing, above a stimulus threshold similar to that for induction of the UES twitch contraction. Fluid perfusion augmented the ability of the magnetic stimulus to induce swallowing. We concluded that a magnetically induced single electrical stimulus of the cerebral cortex produces UES contraction and induces swallowing. The effect on swallowing is facilitated by sensory stimulation of the pharynx. This technique holds the potential for further study of 1) motor and sensory neural mechanisms involved in the control of swallowing and 2) the assessment and management of oropharyngeal dysphagia in humans.", "pages": "414-6; discussion 415-6"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "The muscle silent period following transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8447403", "authors": ["Wilson, SA", "Lockwood, RJ", "Thickbroom, GW", "Mastaglia, FL"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex during tonic muscle contraction produces a motor evoked potential followed by a silent period in the electromyogram. We sought to characterize the TMS induced silent period and to compare it to the silent period induced by supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation. TMS was delivered to the motor cortex using a 9 cm diameter circular coil and the surface electromyogram was recorded from the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis muscle in six normal subjects. Increasing TMS stimulus intensity from 10 to 50% above threshold resulted in an increase in the duration of the silent period from a mean of 50 ms to 185 ms. Increasing the level of tonic muscle contraction from 5% of maximum to maximum resulted in a decrease in silent period duration from a mean of 155 ms to 133 ms. In contrast, the duration of the silent period following supramaximal median nerve stimulation showed greater shortening under similar conditions, from a mean of 160 ms at 5% of maximum contraction to 99 ms at 75% of maximum contraction. The TMS induced silent period was present during a TMS induced increase in the reaction time for a ballistic movement, the onset of movement being delayed until the end of the silent period. Peripheral nerve stimulation did not produce a delay in movement onset. The present findings favour a cortical origin for the TMS induced silent period, probably on the basis of intracortical inhibition, rather than peripheral inhibition of spinal motoneurones which is considered to be the basis for the silent period following peripheral nerve stimulation.", "pages": "414-6; discussion 415-6"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "The interval between the positive peak of premyoclonus spike and the onset of myoclonus is shorter than the cortical latency in cortical myoclonus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "8445404", "authors": ["Sakai, K", "Ugawa, Y", "Genba, K", "Mannen, T", "Kanazawa, I"], "year": "1993", "journal": "European neurology", "abstract": "In 6 patients with cortical myoclonus, the intervals between the positive peak of the premyoclonus cortical spike and the onset of the myoclonic jerk [interval (Sp-Mcl)] were precisely measured by the computer-assisted jerk-locked averaging method.

The components of the blink reflex were absent in all cases. In 3 patients electrical stimulation was possible (compound muscle action potentials were delayed). With transcranial magnetic stimulation ipsilateral short-latency and contralateral long-latency responses (stimulation of the cortex) were elicited and registered from the M. mentalis as well as 3 times from the M. orbicularis oculi. The short-latency response revealed no prognostic aspects. Despite the missing response, a recovery was possible. Long-latency responses could be evoked in all patients. The extent of delay in latency was strongly correlated with clinical improvement of the paresis. Interestingly, this correlation could also be observed in the single rami of the facial nerve when two muscles were investigated in a patient.

In six subjects, magnetic stimulation was applied over the scalp in the focus for the motor response of those muscles. At intensities below motor threshold, a facilitation of the H-reflex started at a conditioning-test interval of -4 ms (i.e. when the magnetic stimulus lagged the test stimulus by 4 ms), reached a peak at about -2 ms and rapidly decayed. At about -1 ms, the decay attained a local minimum, which in three subjects had values indicating the presence of an inhibition. Thereafter, a second facilitatory phase peaked at about +1 ms. By matching the time course with the latency of the cortical muscle action potential (CMAP) evoked by suprathreshold magnetic stimulation, it is inferred that the motoneuronal discharge coincides with the second peak of facilitation and is preceded by 3-4 ms of subliminal excitation. This early effect could be brought to threshold by convergence of a subliminal Ia EPSP, leading to a reduction of the CMAP latency. The early excitatory effects reported above are as fast as those described as following transcranial electrical stimulation, and should likewise be considered as monosynaptic.", "pages": "414-6; discussion 415-6"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "8299752", "authors": ["Beri\u0107, A"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Advances in neurology", "abstract": "An electroneurographic study was made of the accessory nerve in 15 healthy subjects by conventional peripheral electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation at three different levels: cortical contralateral (frontoparietal), homolateral occipital and at the base of the skull.
