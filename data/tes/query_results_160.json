Physiological brain aging is characterized by a progressive dysfunction and loss of synaptic contacts and neuronal abnormal apoptosis. Neural and synaptic redundancy as well as functional and structural plastic remodeling of brain networking promote maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life but are not sufficient to face the pathologic scenario of excessive synaptic/ neuronal loss as in dementias. It is, then, important to implement techniques that are able to measure changes in normal aging brain and to discriminate the threshold from neurodegenerative processes. Rhythmic electromagnetic brain oscillatory activity is a hallmark of neuronal function and it contains relevant traces of neuronal assemblies cooperation across different brain functions; an integrated approach utilizing modern neurophysiological techniques, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging is promising for largescale, affordable, and non-invasive intercept of at-risk populations both at a group and probably also at a single-subject level. This approach might also guarantee the possibility of studying drug-induced changes in the electrical properties of the human cortex, developing and testing models of brain connectivity and treating neuropsychiatric diseases. In this paper some neurophysiological cutting-edge techniques will be presented that provide innovative information and deal with the broad issue of the role of neurophysiology for the assessment of patho-physiological aging and dementia also providing new insight to the actions of central nervous system drugs at the cortical level.", "pages": "374-5"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Clinical neurophysiology of brain plasticity in aging brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "36", "pmid": "23432716", "authors": ["Rossini, PM", "Ferilli, MA", "Rossini, L", "Ferreri, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "abstract": "This study examined whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor cortex alters the response time in motor suppression using the stop-signal task (SST).", "pages": "374-5"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on the motor suppression in stop-signal task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "23422472", "authors": ["Kwon, JW", "Nam, SH", "Lee, NK", "Son, SM", "Choi, YW", "Kim, CS"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroRehabilitation", "abstract": "Forty healthy subjects were enrolled in this study.

This study evaluated the effects of TFS via TCREs on the memory formation of healthy rats as a safety test of TFS. Short- and long-term memory formation was tested after the application of TFS using the novel object recognition (NOR) test. The following independent groups were used: na\u00efve, control (without TFS), and TFS (treated). The na\u00efve, control, and stimulated groups spent more time investigating the new object than the familiar one during the test phase. Transcranial focal electrical stimulation via TCREs given once does not modify the short- and long-term memory formation in rats in the NOR test.

In this study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data before and after real or sham stimulation on the left DLPFC. Resting state functional connectivity of the stimulated brain region was compared between the two groups. Compared to the sham stimulation group, the tDCS group showed increased DLPFC connectivity to the right hemisphere and decreased DLPFC connectivity to the brain regions around the stimulation site in the left hemisphere.

Deep brain stimulation can provide striking tremor relief, but the introduction of stimulating electrodes deep in the substance of the brain carries significant risks, including those of hemorrhage. Here, we pioneer an alternative approach in which we noninvasively apply transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) over the motor cortex to induce phase cancellation of the rest tremor rhythm. We first identify the timing of cortical oscillations responsible for rest tremor in the periphery by delivering tremor-frequency stimulation over motor cortex but do not couple this stimulation to the on-going tremor-instead, the rhythms simply \"drift\" in and out of phase alignment with one another. Slow alternating periods of phase cancellation and reinforcement result, informing on the phase alignments that induce the greatest change in tremor amplitude. Next, we deliver stimulation at these specified phase alignments to demonstrate controlled suppression of the on-going tremor. With this technique we can achieve almost 50% average reduction in resting tremor amplitude and in so doing form the basis of a closed-loop tremor-suppression therapy that could be extended to other oscillopathies.", "pages": "374-5"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Clinical differentiation and outcome evaluation in vegetative and minimally conscious state patients:the neurophysiological approach.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22305755", "authors": ["De Salvo, S", "Bramanti, P", "Marino, S"], "year": "", "journal": "Functional neurology", "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a prevalent chronic pain syndrome characterized by altered pain and sensory processing in the central nervous system, which is often refractory to multiple therapeutic approaches. Given previous evidence supporting analgesic properties of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in this condition, this study examined the effects of a novel, more focal method of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), using the 4\u00d71-ring configuration of high-definition (HD)-tDCS, on overall perceived pain in fibromyalgia patients. In this patient- and assessor-blind, sham-controlled, crossover trial, 18 patients were randomized to undergo single 20-minute sessions of anodal, cathodal, and sham HD-tDCS at 2.0 mA in a counterbalanced fashion. The center electrode was positioned over the left primary motor cortex. Pain scales and sensory testing were assessed before and after each intervention. A finite element method brain model was generated to predict electric field distribution. We found that both active stimulation conditions led to significant reduction in overall perceived pain as compared to sham. This effect occurred immediately after cathodal HD-tDCS and was evident for both anodal and cathodal HD-tDCS 30 minutes after stimulation. Furthermore, active anodal stimulation induced a significant bilateral increase in mechanical detection thresholds. These interventions proved well tolerated in our patient population.", "pages": "374-5"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Long-term depression-like plasticity of the blink reflex for the treatment of blepharospasm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20739569", "authors": ["Kranz, G", "Shamim, EA", "Lin, PT", "Kranz, GS", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "4\u00d71-ring HD-tDCS, a novel noninvasive brain stimulation technique capable of more focal and targeted stimulation, provides significant reduction in overall perceived pain in fibromyalgia patients as compared to sham stimulation, irrespective of current polarity.
