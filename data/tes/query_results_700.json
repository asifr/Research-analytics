Interictal epileptiform discharges, on the other hand, are not specific enough for SOZ as they are recorded at zones other than the SOZ; they are also recorded from areas that do not generate the ictal pattern and from areas to which ictal discharges propagate. Besides spikes and sharp waves, a novel index of human epileptogenicity has been investigated in association with wide-band electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. We primarily noted the following during clinical neurophysiological analysis for clinical epilepsy. (1) Recent development of digital EEG technology enabled us to record wide-band EEG in a clinical setting. Thus, high frequency (>200 Hz) and low frequency (<1 Hz) components can be reliably recorded using subdural electrodes. Direct current shift, slow shift, ripple, and fast ripple can be well delineated, and they will be potentially useful in the diagnosis and management of epileptic patients. (2) Fiber tractography (morphological parameter) and cortico-cortical-evoked potentials with single cortical stimulation (electrophysiological parameter) elucidated cortico-cortical connections in human brain. The data thus obtained can help us understand the mechanism of seizure propagation and normal cortical functional connectivity. (3) Non-invasive simultaneous recording of EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided information on the roles of deep brain structures associated with scalp-recorded epileptiform discharges. Interventional neurophysiology can shed light on the non-pharmacological treatment of epilepsy. In this report, we discuss these novel electrophysiological approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical epilepsy.", "pages": "355-64"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation may improve stroke-related dysphagia: a pilot study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "21441148", "authors": ["Kumar, S", "Wagner, CW", "Frayne, C", "Zhu, L", "Selim, M", "Feng, W", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Treatment options for stroke-related dysphagia are currently limited.

Either method of stimulation resulted in recordings of short- and long-latency responses (SLRs and LLRs) in CTHY muscle. After DCS, SLRs were recorded in all patients but two, in whom only LLR was obtained; in patient No. 1 (Table 3) LLR was elicited by a strip electrode, while in patient No. 4 (Table 3), LLR was elicited by a hand-held electrode. The possible explanation for eliciting only LLR in patient No. 1 was that the strip electrode did not cover the primary motor cortex. In patient No. 4, only LLR but not SLR was recorded, due to the underlying pathology which displaced M1 for cricothyroid muscle not being accessible to the DCS with the hand-held electrode. As each CTHY muscle is innervated from both hemispheres, CoMEPs were recorded from the left or right CTHY muscle during TES or DCS over either the left or right hemisphere. In healthy subjects, TES elicited SLR with a latency of 13.25 \u00b1 1.38 ms, while in patients the latency was 12.73 \u00b1 0.64 ms.
