Such crossed facilitation should favour patterns of bimanual coordination in which homologous muscles are engaged simultaneously, and disrupt those in which the muscles are activated in an alternating fashion. In order to examine these issues, we obtained responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to stimulation of the cervicomedullary junction (cervicomedullary-evoked potentials, CMEPs), to peripheral nerve stimulation (H-reflexes and f-waves), and elicited stretch reflexes in the relaxed right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle during rhythmic (2 Hz) flexion and extension movements of the opposite (left) wrist. The potentials evoked by TMS in right FCR were potentiated during the phases of movement in which the left FCR was most strongly engaged. In contrast, CMEPs were unaffected by the movements of the opposite limb. These results suggest that there was systematic variation of the excitability of the motor cortex ipsilateral to the moving limb. H-reflexes and stretch reflexes recorded in right FCR were modulated in phase with the activation of left FCR. As the f-waves did not vary in corresponding fashion, it appears that the phasic modulation of the H-reflex was mediated by presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. The observation that both H-reflexes and f-waves were depressed markedly during movements of the opposite indicates that there may also have been postsynaptic inhibition or disfacilitation of the largest motor units. Our findings indicate that the patterned modulation of excitability in motor pathways that occurs during rhythmic movements of the opposite limb is mediated primarily by interhemispheric interactions between cortical motor areas.", "pages": "2343-9"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Shift in sound localization induced by rTMS of the posterior parietal lobe.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "10899195", "authors": ["Lewald, J", "Wienemann, M", "Boroojerdi, B"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex can interrupt voluntary contralateral rhythmic limb movements. Using the method of \"resetting index\" (RI), our study investigated the TMS effect on different types of bimanual movements. Six normal subjects participated. For unimanual movement, each subject tapped either the right or left index finger at a comfortable rate. For bimanual movement, index fingers of both hands tapped in the same (in-phase) direction or in the opposite (antiphase) direction. TMS was applied to each hemisphere separately at various intensities from 0.5 to 1.5 times motor threshold (MT). TMS interruption of rhythm was quantified by RI. For the unimanual movements, TMS disrupted both contralateral and ipsilateral rhythmic hand movements, although the effect was much less in the ipsilateral hand. For the bimanual in-phase task, TMS could simultaneously reset the rhythmic movements of both hands, but the effect on the contralateral hand was less and the effect on the ipsilateral hand was more compared with the unimanual tasks. Similar effects were seen from right and left hemisphere stimulation. TMS had little effect on the bimanual antiphase task. The equal effect of right and left hemisphere stimulation indicates that neither motor cortex is dominant for simple bimanual in-phase movement. The smaller influence of contralateral stimulation and the greater effect of ipsilateral stimulation during bimanual in-phase movement compared with unimanual movement suggest hemispheric coupling. The antiphase movements were resistant to TMS disruption, and this suggests that control of rhythm differs in the 2 tasks. TMS produced a transient asynchrony of movements on the 2 sides, indicating that both motor cortices might be downstream of the clocking command or that the clocking is a consequence of the 2 hemispheres communicating equally with each other.", "pages": "2343-9"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a provocation for epileptic seizures in multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11251064", "authors": ["Haupts, MR", "Daum, S", "Ahle, G", "Holinka, B", "Gehlen, W"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)", "abstract": "Unilateral movements are enabled through a distributed network of motor cortical areas but the relative contribution from the parts of this network is largely unknown.

We found that disruption of right dPMC enhanced mirror activation of the ipsilateral left M1, as probed by motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude to the right FDI. This was not the case with sham rTMS, when rTMS was directed to the right M1, or with rTMS of the right dPMC but without contraction of the left FDI.

Stimulation with 10Hz rTMS produced a better learning performance in terms of target score and execution time than sham stimulation.
