Acceptable results have been obtained during opioid/N2O anesthesia, provided that the concentration of N2O does not exceed 50%. However, this technique may necessitate supplementation with additional agents to achieve adequate depth of anesthesia. Etomidate and ketamine have been reported anecdotally or in nonsurgical situations to produce little tc-MER depression. We investigated the effects on tc-MER amplitude and latency of supplementation of a sufentanil/N2O anesthetic with etomidate or ketamine in patients undergoing spinal instrumentation. Anesthesia was induced with etomidate 0.3 mg/kg and sufentanil 1.5 mg/kg and maintained with sufentanil 0.5 mg/kg/h and N2O 50%. Muscle relaxation was kept at 25% of control. Paired transcranial electrical stimulation was performed. Each patient randomly received either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or etomidate (0.1 mg/kg) as a single bolus intravenously, during stable surgical conditions. Triplicate tc-MERs were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscles before and 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after drug administration. Administration of ketamine did not significantly change tc-MER amplitudes, whereas etomidate resulted in a transient amplitude depression to 72% of control (p < 0.05) at 2 min after injection. Latency remained unchanged with both drugs. In conclusion, the data suggest that both ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and etomidate (0.1 mg/kg) can be used to supplement sufentanil/N2O anesthetic without disrupting tc-MER monitoring.", "pages": "228-33"}, {"volume": "149", "title": "Motor evoked potentials recorded from external anal sphincter by cortical and lumbo-sacral magnetic stimulation: normative data.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9168168", "authors": ["Pelliccioni, G", "Scarpino, O", "Piloni, V"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Electrophysiological activation of the motor pathways can be obtained by electrical or magnetic stimulation.

Our purpose is to present normative data of motor evoked responses from EAS in a group of healthy subjects (age range 19-80 years) using a standardized protocol of magnetic stimulation. Nine females and 7 males, with a mean age of 52.63 years, were included in this study. They had no known neurological and gastrointestinal disease. Magnetic shocks were delivered by a Magstim 200 (Novametrix) and a circular coil, centered on the vertex and on the lumbo-sacral region. Electromyographic recordings were taken from EAS using needle electrodes. The cortical magnetic stimulation was performed in two conditions: at rest and during a mild contraction of pelvic floor muscles. The mean values of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) latencies after cortical stimulation were 26.92+/-3.01 ms at rest and 23.31+/-2.70 ms during facilitation. Motor latency after lumbo-sacral root stimulation was 6.09+/-1.43 ms. The MEPs from EAS are easily obtained and stably reproducible in normal subjects.

Fink). What is not yet known is which of these mechanisms is crucial for the psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. However, it is clear that the effects of ST tend to be relatively acute, and do not attack the deep-seated abnormalities that are the underlying causes of recurrences of affective disorders. This is corroborated by the fact that in animals, most of the effects of ECS on catecholamines and their receptors (and on receptors for benzodiazepines or neuropeptides such as TRH) tend to be relatively transient, and in most cases have been found to represent compensatory adaptations to the induced motor convulsions. However, recent preclinical data using attenuation, and clinical findings using reiterated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), suggest that it may not be necessary to provoke a clonic convulsion in order to achieve the beneficial psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. In rodents receiving stimulation to the cerebellar tonsil, seven daily subacute low-frequency sessions (stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes) produced clear improvement in clonic convulsions and in post-discharge thresholds, together with durable inhibition of convulsions when stimulation was resumed (Weiss et al., 1995). Stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes was more effective than stimulation at 10 or 20 Hz in attenuating convulsions. Although reiterated ECS also induced an anti-triggering effect, this dissipated rapidly over five days (Post et al., 1984). It is of great interest that recent publications have shown that rTMS at 10 or 20 Hz to the left frontal cortex, administered to patients suffering from refractory depression (George et al., 1995) or to patients (hospitalised or not) with milder degrees of depression (Pasquale-Leon et al., 1996), had a moderate or marked antidepressant effect. In these studies, rTMS showed few unwanted effects (other than mild pain in some patients, due to contraction of the temporal muscles); it did not induce motor convulsions, and did not, as such, appear to be associated with the memory loss described in subjective accounts or in preliminary neuropsychological tests (Little and Kimbrell et al., 1996). The optimal frequencies, durations and positions for rTMS to maximise its antidepressant effect still remain to be determined. However, the first controlled and open studies have tended to show that (because of the capacity of rapid magnetic fluxes to produce sub-convulsant electrical discharges that are relatively localised in the brain), rTMS may be found to be a clinically useful antidepressant model. This would suggest the possibility that some of the neurochemical changes induced by the clonic convulsions of ECS could be directly induced by stimulation at the very edge of the threshold (but still below it); this would open up the hope that one day these endogenous neurochemical processes could be identified and exploited in an optimal way for therapeutic purposes.", "pages": "228-33"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Bridging the skull: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in psychiatry.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9253528", "authors": ["Kirkcaldie, M", "Pridmore, S", "Reid, P"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Convulsive therapy", "abstract": "A brief account of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with reference to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is given, identifying similarities and dissimilarities, and discussing their potential therapeutic roles. The insulating properties of the skull prevent specific, noninvasive stimulation of particular brain regions by direct electrical means. ECT allows electrical stimulation of the cortex, but its concomitant seizures and distributed electrical currents can have adverse effects on patients. By contrast, magnetic fields pass almost without attenuation through the skull, and can induce secondary electrical currents in localized areas of the brain. Subconvulsive rTMS does not require seizure or general anesthetic, and does not affect memory. Recent studies suggest that rTMS has therapeutic potential for mood disorders, for which ECT is well established. rTMS is a new technology with the potential to treat some mental disorders currently treated with ECT, with fewer side effects. ECT will almost certainly remain the treatment of choice in some situations, but ECT and rTMS may be alternatives for other patients. It is possible that rTMS will become established in some areas where ECT is not used. Further research will define these roles and evaluate the utility of rTMS.", "pages": "228-33"}, {"volume": "120 ( Pt 6)", "title": "Impaired cortico-bulbar tract function in dysarthria due to hemispheric stroke.

Stimulation of the superficial peroneal or the sural nerve (3 shocks, 3 ms interval, 1 ms duration, 2.5 x perception threshold) evoked a reflex activation of the tibialis anterior muscle at a latency of approximately 70-95 ms in all of nine healthy human subjects. Stimulation of the medial plantar nerve only rarely produced similar effects. The possibility that a transcortical pathway contributes to these late reflex responses was investigated by combining the cutaneous stimulations and a transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex. 2. A significant facilitation of short-latency peaks in the post-stimulus time histogram of single tibialis anterior motor units evoked by the transcortical magnetic stimulation was observed in eight out of nine subjects following stimulation of the superficial peroneal or sural nerves at the latency of the long-latency reflex. In contrast such a facilitation was only rarely seen when the medial plantar nerve was stimulated. 3. With the same timing for the stimuli, the superficial peroneal and sural nerve stimulations also produced a significant increase in the short-latency, presumed monosynaptic, facilitation of the tibialis anterior H reflex produced by the brain stimulation. 4. Similar facilitatory effects of the cutaneous stimuli could not be demonstrated when the magnetic stimulation of the cortex was replaced with electrical stimulation, implying that cortical excitability is affected by a conditioning cutaneous stimulation. 5.

Although it is agreed that magnetic stimulation could be a useful tool for studying information processing in man, we argue that, because of the use of simple reaction time, the results reported so far are difficult to interpret within this theoretical framework. In the present paper, three experiments are reported. Six subjects participated in experiment 1 in which magnetic stimulation was delivered, at different times, during choice reaction time. The effects of the magnetic stimulation of the cortical area involved in the response (induced current passing forward over the motor representation of the responding hand), were compared to the effects of an electrical stimulation of the median nerve (H-reflex). In a first control experiment (experiment 2a; 5 subjects), the coil was placed over the ipsilateral motor cortex (induced current passing backward over the motor representation of the non-responding hand) thus minimizing the probability to excite the same neural nets as in the first experiment. In a second control experiment (experiment 2b; 4 subjects), the coil was placed a few centimeters away from the subject's scalp thus ensuring no stimulation of any neural nets. The results show that: (1) the noise and the smarting of the skin associated with the coil discharge produce an intersensory facilitation thereby shortening reaction time (experiment 2a), (2) actually, the noise produced by the stimulation is sufficient to produce such a facilitatory effect (experiment 2b), (3) a stimulation over the area at the origin of the motor command causes a reaction time delay which counteracts this intersensory facilitation effect (experiment 1), (4) in this latter case, the closer the stimulation to the actual overt response, the longer the delay and (5) there is no trace of correlation between the amplitude of the motor evoked potential and the reaction time change.", "pages": "228-33"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Intraoperative spinal cord monitoring for intramedullary surgery: an essential adjunct.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "7623293", "authors": ["Kothbauer, K", "Deletis, V", "Epstein, FJ"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Pediatric neurosurgery", "abstract": "Intraoperative monitoring of the functional integrity of the spinal cord during removal of intramedullary spinal cord lesions is an aid in intraoperative decision making and a primary tool for the prediction of neurological outcome.

In the senior author's experience with over 130 pediatric patients suffering from intramedullary spinal cord tumors, the neurophysiological data of both motor and sensory evoked potentials was utilized in an integrative fashion. Motor evoked potentials, elicited with single transcranial electrical stimuli and recorded directly from the spinal cord with an electrode in the spinal epidural space, reflect the functional integrity of the corticospinal tract. Motor evoked potentials, elicited with a short train of transcranial electrical stimuli and recorded from limb muscles, reflect the functional integrity of the motor system from the cerebral cortex/white matter to beyond the neuromuscular junction. Both epidural and muscle motor evoked potentials correlated closely with postoperative neurological function. Both techniques provide fast, practical and reliable information on the functional integrity of the motor tracts of the spinal cord. No complications attributable to stimulation or recording occurred. Over time both the technique's reliable power of predicting clinical outcome and its practical versatility have altered the surgical approach in that gross total resections are more readily attempted as long as motor evoked potential data indicate the intact functional integrity of the corticospinal tract.
