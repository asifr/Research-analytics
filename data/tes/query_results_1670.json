Because it accomplishes long-lasting effects and its application is simple, it is used increasingly. However, one drawback is its low focality, caused by 1) the large stimulation electrode and 2) the functionally effective reference electrode, which is also situated on the scalp. We aimed to increase the focality of tDCS, which might improve the interpretation of the functional effects of stimulation because it will restrict its effects to more clearly defined cortical areas. Moreover, it will avoid unwanted reversed effects of tDCS under the reference electrode, which is of special importance in clinical settings, when a homogeneous shift of cortical excitability is needed. Because current density (current strength/electrode size) determines the efficacy of tDCS, increased focality should be accomplished by 1) reducing stimulation electrode size, but keeping current density constant; or 2) increasing reference electrode size under constant current strength. We tested these hypotheses for motor cortex tDCS. The results show that reducing the size of the motor cortex DC-stimulation electrode focalized the respective tDCS-induced excitability changes. Increasing the size of the frontopolar reference electrode rendered stimulation over this cortex functionally inefficient, but did not compromise the tDCS-generated motor cortical excitability shifts. Thus tDCS-generated modulations of cortical excitability can be focused by reducing the size of the stimulation electrode and by increasing the size of the reference electrode. For future applications of tDCS, such paradigms may help to achieve more selective tDCS effects.", "pages": "3109-17"}, {"volume": "102", "title": "Influence of acute inspiratory loading upon diaphragm motor-evoked potentials in healthy humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17234806", "authors": ["Ross, EZ", "Nowicky, AV", "McConnell, AK"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "Acute prior activity of the inspiratory muscles can enhance inspiratory muscle strength and reduce effort perception during subsequent inspiratory efforts. However, the mechanisms subserving these changes are poorly understood. Responses to magnetic stimulation in 10 subjects were studied after an acute bout of nonfatiguing inspiratory muscle loading (IML), corresponding to 40% of subjects' initial maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and after an acute bout of nonloaded, forced inspiration (NLF). Motor-evoked potentials elicited by cortical stimulation (MEP(c)) and by phrenic nerve stimulation (MEP(p)) were recorded transcutaneously from the diaphragm before, immediately after, and 15 min after two sets of 30 inspiratory efforts, at rest and during an MIP effort. After IML, MIP increased to 113 +/- 3% (SE) of baseline and diaphragm MEP(p) (during MIP) significantly increased (129 +/- 10% of baseline). Diaphragmatic MEP(c) (during MIP), expressed as a percentage of maximal MEP(p), decreased after IML (from 29 +/- 9% to 20 +/- 6%; P = 0.017) and after NLF (from 43 +/- 5% to 31 +/- 5%; P = 0.032). Observations from the biceps brachi demonstrated that changes after IML and NLF were specific to the inspiratory muscle, since no significant changes were observed in biceps force generation or in MEP(p) or MEP(c) amplitudes. These data indicate that after IML increased global inspiratory strength is accompanied by increased peripheral excitability and by a dampening of corticospinal excitability of the diaphragm.", "pages": "3109-17"}, {"volume": "1137", "title": "The influence of rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on top-down attentional processes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17229406", "authors": ["Vanderhasselt, MA", "De Raedt, R", "Baeken, C", "Leyman, L", "Clerinx, P", "D'haenen, H"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) provides a unique opportunity to study causal relationships between activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and executive functioning, by modulating brain activity in SHAM controlled designs. We devised a new Stroop task paradigm in which subjects must engage in both strategic and automatic attentional processes. In the current experiment, we manipulated subjects' expectancies for incongruent stimuli. Previous research demonstrated that when subjects have a high level of expectancy that a stimulus will be incongruent, they are able to strategically adjust the relative influence of word reading on color naming. The effect of high frequency (HF) rTMS on Stroop performance of 20 right-handed healthy female volunteers was tested using a double blind within subjects design by counterbalanced crossover sham (placebo) and active rTMS over the right DLPFC. Since mood remained unchanged after rTMS, the Stroop data could be evaluated independent of mood changes. Only in the high expectancy condition, we found a decreased response time to both congruent and incongruent trials on the Stroop task performance after HF rTMS. The SHAM placebo condition yielded no effects. We conclude that high frequency stimulation over the right DLPFC has an effect on top-down attentional processes by modulating the attentional set.", "pages": "3109-17"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Electrophysiological evaluation of motor pathways to proximal lower limb muscles: a combined method and reference values.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17223381", "authors": ["Alisauskiene, M", "Magistris, MR", "Vaiciene, N", "Truffert, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In contrast with their important functional and clinical role, motor pathways to proximal muscles of lower limbs are rarely investigated in clinical neurophysiology.

For this purpose we evaluated the after-effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on excitability of the motor cortex of eight ALS patients and eight healthy controls. Healthy controls showed a transient polarity-specific change in corticospinal excitability of about +/-45%, with anodal tDCS inducing facilitation and cathodal tDCS leading to inhibition, whereas no change could be induced in ALS patients after either type of tDCS. It is likely that the lack of tDCS after-effects in ALS is the result of alterations of the motoneuronal membrane or, alternatively, may represent an electrophysiological correlate of disordered glutamate neurotransmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results.

To prevent motor deficits, either somatosensory (SSEP) or transcranial motor evoked potentials (MEP) are applied. This prospective study was conducted to evaluate if the combined use of SSEP and MEP might be beneficial. Combined SSEP/MEP monitoring was attempted in 100 consecutive procedures, including intracranial and spinal operations. Repetitive transcranial electric motor cortex stimulation was used to elicit MEP from muscles of the upper and lower limb. Stimulation of the tibial and median nerves was performed to record SSEP. Critical SSEP/MEP changes were defined as decreases in amplitude of more than 50% or increases in latency of more than 10% of baseline values. The operation was paused or the surgical strategy was modified in every case of SSEP/MEP changes. Combined SSEP/MEP monitoring was possible in 69 out of 100 operations. In 49 of the 69 operations (71%), SSEP/ MEP were stable, and the patients remained neurologically intact. Critical SSEP/ MEP changes were seen in six operations. Critical MEP changes with stable SSEP occurred in 12 operations. Overall, critical MEP changes were recorded in 18 operations (26%). In 12 of the 18 operations, MEP recovered to some extent after modification of the surgical strategy, and the patients either showed no (n = 10) or only a transient motor deficit (n = 2). In the remaining six operations, MEP did not recover and the patients either had a transient (n = 3) or a permanent (n = 3) motor deficit. Critical SSEP changes with stable MEP were observed in two operations; both patients did not show a new motor deficit. Our data again confirm that MEP monitoring is superior to SSEP monitoring in detecting impending impairment of the functional integrity of cerebral and spinal cord motor pathways during surgery. Detection of MEP changes and adjustment of the surgical strategy might allow to prevent irreversible pyramidal tract damage. Stable SSEP/MEP recordings reassure the surgeon that motor function is still intact and surgery can be continued safely. The combined SSEP/ MEP monitoring becomes advantageous, if one modality is not recordable.", "pages": "3109-17"}]
