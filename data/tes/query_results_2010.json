The costal and crural motor evoked potential recruitment curves during submaximal inspiratory efforts were similar. The response to stimulation before, during and at 10 and 30 min after 44 consecutive maximal inspiratory efforts was also the same. Using paired stimulations to investigate intra-cortical facilitatory and inhibitory circuits we found no difference between the costal and crural response with varying interstimulus intervals, or when conditioning and test stimulus intensity were varied.

Patients were evaluated before and immediately following treatment, and at one and three months after the end of treatment. Outcome measures were: the \"neck pain and disability visual analogue scale\" (NPDVAS), an algometric evaluation of pain, an evaluation of the TP characteristics, and the range of cervical bending and rotation contralateral to the affected trapezius muscle. At the end of treatment, the rMS group showed a significant improvement in the NPDVAS, algometry, TP characteristics, and cervical contralateral rotation. This improvement also persisted at one and three months post-therapy. After treatment, the TENS group showed significant improvement in the same outcome measures except for algometry. At the one month follow-up visit, this improvement had returned to non significant levels in all outcome measures with the exception of NPDVAS. No significant effect of TENS was seen at the three-month follow-up visit. The placebo group showed no significant improvement in any measure.

The objectives of this study were, i) to evaluate the corticonuclear descending fibers to the perioral muscles and, ii) to determine how central facial palsy (CFP) occurs and often recovers rapidly following a stroke. Eighteen healthy volunteers and 28 patients with a previous history of a stroke and CFP (mean ages: 51 and 61 years) were investigated by TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) with a figure of eight coil. Intracranial facial nerve and cortical motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the perioral muscles. The periorbital MEPs were also studied. The absence of MEPs in both perioral muscles with TMS of the affected hemisphere was the most obvious abnormality. Also, central conduction time was significantly prolonged in the remaining patients. The mean amplitude of the affected hemisphere MEPs was diminished. The amplitudes of the unaffected hemisphere MEPs recorded from the intact side were enhanced especially in the first week following the stroke. During TMS, only the blink reflexes were elicited from the periorbital muscles due to stimulus spreading to trigeminal afferent nerve fibers. It is concluded that perioral muscles are innervated by the corticobulbar tract bilaterally. CFP caused by a stroke is generally incomplete and mild because of the ipsilateral cortical and multiple innervations out of the infarction area, and recovers fast through cortical reorganisation.", "pages": "87-9"}, {"volume": "252", "title": "Corticonuclear innervation to facial muscles in normal controls and in patients with central facial paresis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15726262", "authors": ["Yildiz, N", "Ertekin, C", "Ozdemirkiran, T", "Yildiz, SK", "Aydogdu, I", "Uludag, B", "Secil, Y"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Sensorimotor integration is an essential feature of the central nervous system that contributes to the accurate performance of motor tasks. Some patients with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonian features (MSAp) exhibit clinical signs compatible with an abnormal central nervous system excitability to somatosensory inputs, such as action myoclonus or enhanced cutaneo-muscular reflexes. To investigate further the site where such dysfunction in sensorimotor integration takes place, we examined the inhibitory effects of a cutaneous afferent volley at two different levels of the motor system in 10 MSAp patients and in 10 age-matched healthy volunteers. Electrical digital nerve stimuli were given as the conditioning stimulus for the motor evoked potentials (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation in hand muscles, and for the blink reflex responses obtained in the orbicularis oculi muscles by supraorbital nerve stimulation. Intervals for the conditioning were 20 to 50 ms for the MEP and 90 to 110 ms for the blink reflex. The MEP was significantly inhibited in test trials in healthy volunteers, reaching a mean of 32% of the baseline values at the ISI of 35 ms. Significant inhibition occurred also in the blink reflex, in which the R2 response was a mean of 12% of baseline values at the ISI of 100 ms. The inhibitory effects were abnormally reduced in 8 patients on the MEP, and in 7 patients on the blink reflex. There were significant group differences between patients and control subjects in the size of the conditioned MEP and blink reflex. These results suggest that sensorimotor integration is abnormal in patients with MSAp in at least two central nervous system sites: the sensorimotor cortex, and the brainstem reticular formation.", "pages": "87-9"}, {"volume": "252", "title": "Sensorimotor integration in patients with parkinsonian type multisystem atrophy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15726255", "authors": ["Mascia, MM", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Mart\u00ed, MJ", "Salazar, G"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate effects of voluntary teeth clenching (VTC) on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) by different oriented currents (anterior-medially (AM), posterior-laterally (PL)) of the human motor cortex. In active FDI, VTC enhanced MEP responses induced by AM directed current but reduced these responses induced by PL. In relaxed FDI, VTC enhanced MEP responses by AM but had no significant effects on those by PL. Thus, the results suggest that any components produced by AM directed current were enhanced, whereas those by PL directed currents were not affected or reduced. The present evidence indicates that I-waves recorded at the same latency were not completely the same between those produced by AM and PL directed currents. Because VTC had no influence on responses to brainstem electrical stimulation (BES) or F-waves just after the onset of teeth clenching [T. Furubayashi, K. Sugawara, T. Kasai, A. Hayashi, R. Hanajima, Y. Shiio, N.K. Iwara, Y. Ugawa, Remote effects of self-paced teeth clenching on the excitability of hand motor area, Exp. Brain Res., 148 (2003) 261-265], these modulatory effects on MEPs to both AM and PL directed currents must be due to changes of the motor cortical excitability. Thus, we conclude that VTC affects the motor cortical circuits activated by PL and AM directed currents differentially; it facilitates the one and inhibits the other. This is the first demonstration of opposite effects of the same maneuver on MEP responses elicited by AM and PL directed currents.", "pages": "87-9"}, {"volume": "377", "title": "Remote effects of voluntary teeth clenching on excitability changes of the human hand motor area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15722181", "authors": ["Sugawara, K", "Furubayashi, T", "Takahashi, M", "Ni, Z", "Ugawa, Y", "Kasai, T"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Connections between the cerebellum and the contralateral motor cortex are dense and important, but their physiological significance is difficult to measure in humans. We have studied a group of 10 healthy subjects to test whether a modulation of the excitability of the left cerebellum can affect the excitability of the contralateral motor cortex. We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at 1 Hz frequency to transiently depress the excitability of the left cerebellar cortex and paired-pulse TMS testing of intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) to probe the excitability of cortico-cortical connections in the right motor cortex. The cortical silent period was also measured before and after cerebellar rTMS. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were significantly larger after than before conditioning rTMS trains (p < 0.01). Moreover, left cerebellar rTMS increased the ICF of the right motor cortex as measured with paired-pulses separated by an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 15 ms. The effect lasted for up to 30 min afterward and was specific for the contralateral (right) motor cortex. The cortical silent period was unaffected by cerebellar rTMS. The implication is that rTMS of the cerebellar cortex can shape the flowing of inhibition from Purkinje cells toward deep nuclei, thereby increasing the excitability of interconnected brain areas.", "pages": "87-9"}, {"volume": "376", "title": "Increased facilitation of the primary motor cortex following 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral cerebellum in normal humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15721219", "authors": ["Oliveri, M", "Koch, G", "Torriero, S", "Caltagirone, C"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the left and right temporoparietal cortex compared with sham stimulation in schizophrenic patients with treatment-refractory auditory hallucinations (AH).
