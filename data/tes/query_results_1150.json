In mapping experiments, a grid of coil positions is used to systematically assess the TMS effect on, e.g. muscle responses or error rates. The center-of-mass (CoM) of the response distribution is projected onto the cortex to determine the likely target site, implicitly assuming the existence of a single, contiguous target. The mapping results, however, often contain several local maxima. These could either stem from measurement noise, or hint towards a distributed target region. Critically, the calculation of a CoM, by design, treats multiple maxima as if they were noise. Here, a stringent hierarchical sigmoidal model fitting approach is developed that determines the cortical target(s) from TMS mapping based on electric field calculations. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to assess the significance and the goodness-of-fit of the sigmoidal fits, and to obtain confidence regions around the calculated targets. The approach was applied to mapping data on visual suppression (N=7). In all subjects, we reliably identified two or three neighboring targets commonly contributing to the suppression effect (average distance+/-SD: 7.7+/-2.3 mm). This demonstrates that (i) the assumption of a single CoM is not generally valid and (ii) the combination of TMS mapping with the fitting approach has a cortical resolution of <1 cm. The estimates for the field strength necessary to achieve 50% of the maximal suppression effect vary noticeably across subjects (mean+/-SD: 139+/-24 V/m), indicating inter-individual differences in the susceptibility to TMS.", "pages": "1319-30"}, {"volume": "66", "title": "Dysfunctions of cortical excitability in drug-na\u00efve posttraumatic stress disorder patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19368897", "authors": ["Rossi, S", "De Capua, A", "Tavanti, M", "Calossi, S", "Polizzotto, NR", "Mantovani, A", "Falzarano, V", "Bossini, L", "Passero, S", "Bartalini, S", "Ulivelli, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The investigation of a wide set of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-related variables in both hemispheres might help to identify a pattern of cortical excitability changes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, reflecting gamma-amino-butiric acid (GABA)/glutamate balance and dysfunction, and to determine whether some of these variables are related to clinical features.", "pages": "1319-30"}, {"volume": "153", "title": "[Treatment of central and facial pain.

These two factors, known as stimulus-driven and goal-directed factors, respectively, are thought to be integrated into a unique salience map, possibly located in the frontal or the parietal cortex. However, the distinct contribution of these two regions to salience representation is difficult to establish experimentally and remains debated. In an attempt to address this issue, we designed several dual tasks composed of a letter reporting task and a visual search task, allowing us to quantify the salience of each visual item by measuring its probability to be selected by attention. In Experiment 1, the salience of the visual search items depended on a combination of conspicuity and relevance factors, whereas in Experiment 2, stimulus-driven and goal-directed factors were tested separately. Then, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to interfere transiently with the function of the right angular gyrus (ANG) or right FEFs in healthy subjects performing these dual tasks. We found that interfering with the ANG and the FEF function specifically altered the influence of salience on the letter report rate without affecting the overall letter reporting rate, suggesting that these areas are involved in salience representation. In particular, the present study suggests that ANG is involved in goal-directed salience representation, whereas FEF would rather house a global salience map integrating both goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors.", "pages": "1319-30"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "Invasive cortical stimulation to promote recovery of function after stroke: a critical appraisal.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "19359643", "authors": ["Plow, EB", "Carey, JR", "Nudo, RJ", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases has been used for more than 50 years. Although its development has been slow, current advances in the techniques of brain stimulation have improved its clinical efficacy. The use of non-invasive brain stimulation has significant advantages, such as not involving surgical procedures and having relatively mild adverse effects. In this paper we briefly review the use of 2 non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), as therapeutic approaches in physical and rehabilitation medicine. We also compare the effects of non-invasive central nervous system stimulation with techniques of non-invasive peripheral electrical stimulation, in order to provide new insights for future developments. Although the outcomes of these initial trials include some conflicting results, the evidence supports that rTMS and tDCS might have a therapeutic value in different neurological conditions. Studies published within the last year have examined new approaches of stimulation, such as longer intensities of stimulation, new electrode sizes for tDCS, novel coils for stimulation of deeper areas, and new frequencies of stimulation for rTMS. These new approaches need to be tested in larger clinical trials in order to determine whether they offer significant clinical effects.", "pages": "1319-30"}, {"volume": "219", "title": "Translational development strategy for magnetic seizure therapy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16678818", "authors": ["Rowny, SB", "Benzl, K", "Lisanby, SH"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Consistent with a functional role of the motor system in speech perception, disturbing the activity of the left ventral premotor cortex by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to impair auditory identification of syllables that were masked with white noise. However, whether this region is crucial for speech perception under normal listening conditions remains debated. To directly test this hypothesis, we applied rTMS to the left ventral premotor cortex and participants performed auditory speech tasks involving the same set of syllables but differing in the use of phonemic segmentation processes. Compared to sham stimulation, rTMS applied over the ventral premotor cortex resulted in slower phoneme discrimination requiring phonemic segmentation. No effect was observed in phoneme identification and syllable discrimination tasks that could be performed without need for phonemic segmentation. The findings demonstrate a mediating role of the ventral premotor cortex in speech segmentation under normal listening conditions and are interpreted in relation to theories assuming a link between perception and action in the human speech processing system.", "pages": "1319-30"}, {"volume": "219", "title": "Stimulating the brain to treat depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16900046", "authors": ["Bajbouj, M", "Heuser, I"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Residual motor deficits frequently linger after stroke.
