The key hardware components include slew-rate limited preamplifiers to prevent saturation of the EEG system due to TMS. The protocol involves artifact subtraction to isolate the electrophysiological signals from residual TMS-induced contaminations. The TMS compatibility of the protocol is illustrated with examples of two data sets demonstrating the feasibility of the approach in the single-pulse TMS design, as well as during repetitive TMS. Our data show that both high-amplitude potentials evoked by visual checkerboard stimulation and low-amplitude steady-state oscillations induced by auditory click-trains can be retrieved with the present protocol. The signals recorded during TMS perfectly matched control EEG responses to the same visual and auditory stimuli. The main field of application of the present protocol is in cognitive neuroscience complementing behavioral studies that use TMS to induce transient, 'virtual lesions'. Combined EEG-TMS techniques provide neuroscientists with a unique method to test hypothesis on functional connectivity, as well as on mechanisms of functional orchestration, reorganization, and plasticity.", "pages": "181-3"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Caffeine has no effect on measures of cortical excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15661302", "authors": ["Orth, M", "Amann, B", "Ratnaraj, N", "Patsalos, PN", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To assess the effect of caffeine on motor thresholds, short interval intra-cortical inhibition (SICI), intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) and cortical silent periods in a placebo controlled double-blinded trial.", "pages": "181-3"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Motor cortex dysfunction revealed by cortical excitability studies in Parkinson's disease: influence of antiparkinsonian treatment and cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15661109", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In eleven healthy non-smoking subjects the following parameters were measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): motor thresholds (rest, RMT and active, AMT), SICI and ICF at different conditioning stimulus intensities (60, 70, 80, 90% AMT), cortical silent periods at 130, 150 and 175% AMT, and size of motor evoked potential at rest at 110, 125 and 150% RMT.

Various changes in TMS parameters, revealing motor cortex dysfunction, were found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). For instance, low MT and increased MEP size disclosed an enhanced corticospinal motor output at rest, while reduced ICF and failure of MEP size increase during contraction suggested defective facilitatory cortical inputs, particularly for movement execution. Inhibitory cortical pathways were also found less excitable at rest (reduced ICI) and sometimes during contraction (shortened CSP). By restoring cortical inhibition, dopaminergic drugs and deep brain stimulation probably overcome the difficulty to focus neuronal activity onto the appropriate network required for a specific motor task. The application of repetitive TMS trains over motor cortical areas also showed some effect on cortical excitability, opening perspectives to consider the motor cortex as a target for therapeutic neuromodulation in PD. However, systematic studies of cortical excitability remained to be performed in large series of patients with PD, taking into account disease stage, clinical symptoms and medication influence.", "pages": "181-3"}, {"volume": "252", "title": "Uncrossed cortico-muscular projections in humans are abundant to facial muscles of the upper and lower face, but may differ between sexes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15654554", "authors": ["Fischer, U", "Hess, CW", "R\u00f6sler, KM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "This study examines the effect of high-level skilled behaviour on motor cortex representations of upper extremity muscles of ten sportswomen. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to map proximal medial deltoid and distal extensor carpi radialis muscle representations on both hemispheres during low-level voluntary contraction. We compared cortical representation areas between two groups of subjects and between hemispheres within subjects. The first group comprised five elite volleyball attackers and the second group five runners. Four stimuli were delivered on multiple scalp sites (1.5 cm apart) to induce motor-evoked potentials recorded by surface EMG. Maps were described in terms of excitable scalp positions and of motor-evoked potentials. We observed differences in map areas between the two groups. Volleyball players had larger cortical representations of the proximal medial deltoid muscle than runners. Furthermore, the volleyball players had larger map areas for dominant muscles compared with non-dominant muscles. There was no difference, however, in map area for either muscle between the dominant and non-dominant arm in the runner group. Our results show that heavy training in a specific skill induces an expansion of proximal muscle representation in the contralateral primary motor cortex. This enlarged map area for proximal muscle is accompanied by an increase in the overlapping of proximal and distal muscle representations. This could reflect the fact that motor learning of co-ordinated movement involves a common control of both muscles. This reorganization supports the hypothesis of a cortical plasticity driven by activity.", "pages": "181-3"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Slow transcranial magnetic stimulation can rapidly reduce resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15654551", "authors": ["Poulet, E", "Brunelin, J", "Bediou, B", "Bation, R", "Forgeard, L", "Dalery, J", "d'Amato, T", "Saoud, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The few electrophysiologic studies of the cremasteric muscle (CM) have mainly been restricted to the cremaster reflex with no reference to central and peripheral nerve conduction to the muscle, probably for technical reasons.Twenty-six normal adult male volunteers were studied by transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation (TMS) and stimulation of thoracolumbar roots. The genitofemoral nerve (GFN) was stimulated electrically at the anterior superior iliac spine and a needle electrode was inserted into the CM for conduction studies. The motor latency to the CM from the cortical TMS ranged from 20 to 33 ms among the subjects (25.8 +/- 2.9 ms, mean +/- SD). Magnetic stimulation of the lumbar roots produced a motor response of the CM within 9.6 +/- 1.9 ms (range, 6-15). The central motor conduction time to the CM was 16.5 +/- 2.8 ms (range, 10-21). Stimulation of the GFN produced a compound muscle action potential with a mean value of 6.4 +/- 1.8 (range, 4-10) ms in 23 of the 26 cases. Thus, central motor nerve fibers to the CM motor neurons exist, and there may be a representation area for the CM in the cerebral cortex. The GFN motor conduction time to the CM may have clinical utility, such as in the evaluation of the groin pain due to surgical procedures in the lower abdomen.", "pages": "181-3"}]
