A single motor-threshold electrical stimulus to the radial nerve in the spiral groove produced three phases of inhibition in the H reflex of relaxed wrist and finger flexor muscles. The first phase of inhibition occurred with a conditioning-test interval of -1 to 3 ms and represents disynaptic Ia reciprocal inhibition of flexor motoneurones by afferent input from extensor muscles. The second phase occurred with a conditioning-test interval of 5-40 ms. The characteristics of the second inhibitory phase have been investigated in the present study. 2. The threshold intensity of radial nerve stimulation required to produce the second phase of inhibition was 0.7 X motor threshold and was the same as that required to produce the first (disynaptic) phase of inhibition. 3. The time course of the effect of a radial nerve stimulus on the size of e.m.g. response to transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex also was studied. The results were compared to those obtained with H reflex testing. The time course and depth of the first phase of inhibition were identical with both test inputs. The second phase of inhibition, however, was seen only with the H reflex test stimulus. When the corticospinal volley was timed to arrive at the cervical cord 30 ms after the radial nerve afferent volley, the flexor muscle response was facilitated rather than inhibited. 4. A single stimulus (2-3 X sensory threshold) to the superficial (cutaneous) branch of the radial nerve at the wrist failed to produce inhibition of the flexor H reflex. Instead, the H reflex was facilitated when the median nerve Ia volley (for the H reflex) was timed to arrive at the cervical cord between 30-40 ms after the radial nerve cutaneous afferent volley. In contrast to results using mixed nerve stimulation in the spiral groove, there was no difference between the effect of this cutaneous input on the cortically evoked e.m.g. response and the H reflex. 5. We conclude that the second phase of flexor H reflex inhibition is produced by activity in large-diameter (group I) extensor muscle afferents which acts on the H reflex pathway at a premotoneuronal site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "71-83"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "[Methodology and normal values in recording evoked motor potentials following transcranial stimulation in the human].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "16992116", "authors": ["Ludolph, AC", "Elger, CE", "G\u00f6ssling, JH", "Hugon, J"], "year": "1987", "journal": "EEG-EMG Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektroenzephalographie, Elektromyographie und verwandte Gebiete", "abstract": "Electric non-invasive stimulation of the motor cortex was performed in 19 healthy subjects.

The response chosen was that elicited by a corticocortical afferent input, specifically the transcallosal response (TCR). We used ourselves as subjects. The large shock artifacts associated with passing large currents through the head were reduced by: stimulating percutaneously with a focal anode (5 cm2) situated midway between F4 and C4 (i.e., frontal region, standard 10-20 nomenclature) and a medially located, semicircular grounded cathode (26 cm2) no closer than 3 to 4 cm away; and recording with the focal scalp electrode over homologous left frontal cortex vs. two or more reference electrodes interconnected through variable resistors and at least 6 cm away. Transcranial stimulation with pulses of 80 to 140 mA and lasting 100 microseconds elicited a brief diphasic deflection (latency, 2 to 4 ms), followed by an initially positive, often bifid wave with a latency of 9 to 14 ms, lasting 18 to 44 ms and reaching 5 to 10 microV. The initial diphasic deflection greatly increased when the stimulating anode was moved laterally over temporalis muscle, indicating an electromyographic (EMG) origin. The EMG, but not the positive wave, was elicited when the interpolar distance was reduced to 1 cm, which greatly reduced the fraction of current traversing the cortex (epicranial stimulation); furthermore, occluding the circulation to the scalp for 30 minutes by rubber tubing above the zygomas and brows dulled sensation, reduced the EMG, but did not alter the latency or rising phase of the positive wave.

The latter cause only a trivial scalp sensation. Stimuli exciting the motor cortex cause contralateral muscle responses, but the threshold for excitation is markedly reduced by slight voluntary contraction of the target muscle. For small hand muscles, the overall latency from scalp to muscle is shorter by 1.8 ms when electrical stimuli are used than when stimuli are magnetic. Central motor conduction time (CMCT) can be estimated by stimulating over the scalp and then over the cervical area. In healthy subjects, the CMCT is 6.1 +/- 0.8 (SD) (n = 29). Physiological studies have shown that the facilitation of responses in hand muscles produced by voluntary contraction is also present when contralateral muscles are used, but not when a leg muscle is contracted. The mechanism of facilitation may involve neural activity at both spinal and cortical levels. Single motor units can be caused to discharge by threshold brain stimuli. These motor units are the same ones activated first during weak voluntary contractions. Clinical studies have shown that the CMCT may be greatly prolonged in patients with multiple sclerosis and that subclinical motor pathway lesions can be detected. Central conduction may also be abnormal in patients with motor neuron disease and cervical myelopathy.

The data of motor evoked potentials (MEP) demonstrated in all patients a normal central motor conduction time of 5.0 msec. In 30% of patients the VEP data showed a significant delay of P2 latency, independently of clinical status or age. But there were no more P2 alterations after special visual stimulation techniques.
