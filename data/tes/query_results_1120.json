While it has been demonstrated that the contralateral hemisphere is dominant in visuo-motor integration, involvement of the ipsilateral hemisphere has also been proposed. Furthermore, a dominant role for left posterior parietal cortex has been shown in this process, independently of the hand and visual field involved. In this study, the possible involvement of ipsilateral parieto-occipital cortex in planning of reaching movements was investigated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS was applied on four points of the parietal and occipital cortex at 50% (Time 1), 75% (Time 2) and 90% (Time 3) of reaction time from a go-signal to hand movement. The only effect observed was an increase in reaction time when a region around the parieto-occipital junction was stimulated at Time 2. These results provide further support to the hypothesis that, in the posterior parietal cortex, planning of reaching movements also relies on the ipsilateral hemisphere, in addition to the contralateral or dominant one.", "pages": "112-6"}, {"volume": "460", "title": "The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on the cortical activation by motor task in the human brain: an fMRI study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19450657", "authors": ["Jang, SH", "Ahn, SH", "Byun, WM", "Kim, CS", "Lee, MY", "Kwon, YH"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "We attempted to evaluate whether cortical activation resulting from hand movements is changed by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied on the primary motor cortex for the hand in the human brain, using functional MRI (fMRI).", "pages": "112-6"}, {"volume": "460", "title": "Motor cortical organization in an adult with hemimegalencephaly and late onset epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19450654", "authors": ["Civardi, C", "Vicentini, R", "Collini, A", "Boccagni, C", "Cantello, R", "Monaco, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Fourteen normal subjects were recruited; subjects were randomly assigned to either the tDCS group (n=7) or the sham group (n=7). fMRI was performed with hand grasp-release movements at 1Hz before and after 20 min of intervention (the tDCS group: anodal tDCS, the sham group: sham stimulation).", "pages": "112-6"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Evaluation of the applicability of sevoflurane during post-tetanic myogenic motor evoked potential monitoring in patients undergoing spinal surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19444553", "authors": ["Hayashi, H", "Kawaguchi, M", "Abe, R", "Yamamoto, Y", "Inoue, S", "Koizumi, M", "Takakura, Y", "Furuya, H"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of anesthesia", "abstract": "The activation of the tDCS underlying primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) was significantly increased in the tDCS group (p<0.05).
