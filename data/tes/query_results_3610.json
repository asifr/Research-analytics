Five of the 11 patients showed normal somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) along the same arm. The short term (2-4 weeks) follow-up study in 10 patients showed normalization of the prolonged CMCT in one and reappearance of MEPs with C7 stimulation in another.

After transcutaneous stimulation of the cervical cord with single electrical stimuli, the latency is not affected by muscle contraction. This is thought to be due to a lack of temporal summation at the spinal motoneurones. Results are different when paired stimuli are used. With contraction most motoneurones respond to the first cervical stimulus while in a relaxed condition they respond to the second. Temporal summation brings motoneurones to their firing threshold. Therefore, cervical double stimulation is more effective than single stimuli. It is however less powerful than cortical stimulation. Paired stimuli are most powerful at an interval of 2 ms similar to the D I-wave interval after cortical stimulation.", "pages": "409-15"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation excites the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve: an intraoperative electrophysiological study in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2067727", "authors": ["Schmid, UD", "M\u00f8ller, AR", "Schmid, J"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The site where transcranial magnetic stimulation (magStim) depolarizes the facial nerve was investigated in 6 patients who underwent surgery of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The facial nerve was stimulated (1) magnetically prior to craniotomy, (2) electrically near the brainstem (elREZ), (3) at the exit from the CPA into the facial canal (elPorus), and (4) in the stylomastoid fossa (elStylo). The range of latency differences (delta) of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) recorded from the ipsilateral mentalis muscle were as follows: delta elREZ-magStim: +0.5 to +1.1 ms (P less than or equal to 0.03, Wilcoxon test); delta elPorus-magStim: +0.2 to +0.5 ms (P less than or equal to 0.03); delta elStylo-magStim: +0.8 to +1.0 ms (P less than or equal to 0.03). On the basis of anatomical data and a facial nerve conduction velocity of 33-46 m/s in these patients, it was concluded that transcranial magnetic stimuli depolarized the facial nerve at a location 10-15 mm distal to its entrance into the facial canal. This corresponds to the end of the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve, i.e. the transit zone where the nerve ceases to be surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with its high electrical conductivity and enters the high-resistance tissue of the petrous bone.", "pages": "409-15"}, {"volume": "238", "title": "Induction of seizures by transcranial magnetic stimulation in epileptic patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "1856737", "authors": ["Hufnagel, A", "Elger, CE"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "The interval between muscle stretch and the onset of the long latency electromyographic responses (LLRs) has been theoretically fragmented into an afferent time (AT), taken at the peak of wave N20 of somatosensory evoked potentials and an efferent time (ET), calculated by means of magnetic transcranial stimulation (TCS), the two being separated by a cortical interval (CI). If this were the case, the afferent input should progressively 'energize' the sensorimotor cortex during the CI and change the excitability of cortico-spinal tracts. To investigate this, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from thumb flexor muscles were recorded, whilst a conditioning stimulation of median or ulnar nerve randomly preceded (10-48 msec intervals) magnetic brain TCS. Nerve stimulation was adjusted to motor threshold and amplitudes of conditioned and test MEPs at different nerve-TCS interstimulus intervals were evaluated. Conditioned MEPs were significantly attenuated with nerve-TCS intervals between 16 and 20 msec for elbow and 20 and 22 msec for wrist stimulation. This was followed by MEP potentiation with nerve-TCS intervals corresponding to the sum of AT + CI (mean 23.2 msec, range 21.7-24.8). The onset latency of facilitated conditioned MEPs was about 1 msec briefer than that of test MEPs, but invariably longer than the latency of MEPs facilitated by a voluntary contraction.

The effect of muscle stretch on the EMG response from the stretched muscle to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex was studied in eight subjects. Muscle stretch was produced by increasing the torque of a motor acting through a lever which was held at constant position by a flexion force of the index and middle fingers. EMG responses were recorded from fine-wire electrodes inserted into flexor digitorum profundus muscle in the forearm. They consisted of a spinal latency component and a long-latency component which could in some subjects be separated into an early and a late phase. 2. In four subjects, four intervals between the stretch and the cortical stimulus were explored using three intensities of cortical stimulation. At all three intensities, when the magnetic cortical stimulus was timed to produce an EMG response in the period of the later part of the long-latency stretch reflex the response was larger than when it was timed to produce a response in the period of the short-latency spinal reflex or when superimposed on the tonic muscle activity used to resist the standing torque of the motor. 3. When the intensity of magnetic cortical stimulation was reduced so that it was just below threshold to produce an EMG response in the short-latency reflex period or on the background tonic EMG activity, it still was capable of producing a response when superimposed on the long-latency stretch reflex. 4. In four subjects the time course of this effect was studied in more detail using only one intensity of magnetic cortical stimulus set to be just above threshold to produce a response in tonically active muscles. The time course of the facilitatory effect was similar to the time course of the later part of the long-latency stretch reflex. From these data it was not possible to determine whether the early part of the long-latency stretch reflex also was accompanied by the facilitatory effect since this component was present in only one of the four subjects. 5. The facilitatory effect persisted after the ulnar and median nerves were totally blocked at the wrist by injections of local anaesthetic. This suggests that inputs from muscle receptors of the stretched muscle contribute to the effect.4=", "pages": "409-15"}, {"volume": "433", "title": "Changes in the response to magnetic and electrical stimulation of the motor cortex following muscle stretch in man.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "1841949", "authors": ["Day, BL", "Riescher, H", "Struppler, A", "Rothwell, JC", "Marsden, CD"], "year": "1991", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "409-15"}]
