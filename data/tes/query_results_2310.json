This study clarified the effects of acute rTMS treatment on extracellular serotonin (5-HT) concentrations in the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by using in vivo microdialysis methods. Each rat received acute rTMS treatment of the frontal brain at 500 stimuli from twenty trains applied at 25 Hz for 1 s at 1-min intervals between trains. Sham-treated rats received the same handling procedure and sound of the stimulator. Sham treatment increased the extracellular 5-HT levels compared with the non-treated group. However, rTMS treatment using the stimulation intensity of 110% motor threshold eliminated the increase in 5-HT levels induced by the sham treatment. Acute rTMS treatment of the frontal brain is related to the serotonergic neuronal system in the rat PFC, and it may have therapeutic implications for emotional disorders.", "pages": "451-7"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "The transition from development to motor control function in the corticospinal system.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "14736845", "authors": ["Meng, Z", "Li, Q", "Martin, JH"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "During early postnatal development, corticospinal (CS) system stimulation, electrical or transcranial magnetic, is minimally effective in producing muscle contraction, despite having axon terminals that excite spinal neurons. Later, after stimulation becomes more effective, the cortical motor representation develops, and movements the system controls in maturity are expressed. We determined whether development of temporal facilitation (response enhancement produced by the second of a pair of pyramidal tract stimuli, or a higher stimulus multiple of a train of stimuli) correlated with these changes. Facilitation of the monosynaptic CS response was larger in older kittens and adults than younger kittens. When facilitation was strong, strong motor responses were evoked by pyramidal stimulation with small currents and few pulses. With strong facilitation in older kittens, corticospinal axon varicosities colocalize synaptophysin like adults, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism. With effective facilitation, control signals from the cortex can be sufficiently effective to provoke muscle contraction for guiding movements.", "pages": "451-7"}, {"volume": "309", "title": "Brain stimulation for neurological and psychiatric disorders, current status and future direction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14730004", "authors": ["Chang, JY"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "abstract": "Interest in brain stimulation therapies has been rejuvenated over the last decade and brain stimulation therapy has become an alternative treatment for many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, pain, epilepsy, depression, and schizophrenia. The effects of brain stimulation on PD are well described, and this treatment has been widely used for such conditions worldwide. Treatments for other conditions are still in experimental stages and large-scale, well controlled studies are needed to refine the treatment procedures. In the treatment of intractable brain disorders, brain stimulation, especially transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is an attractive alternative to surgical lesioning as it is relatively safe, reversible, and flexible. Brain stimulation, delivered either via deeply implanted electrodes or from a surface-mounted transcranial magnetic device, can alter abnormal neural circuits underlying brain disorders. The neural mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of brain stimulation, however, are poorly understood. Conflicting theories and experimental data have been presented. It seems that the action of stimulation on brain circuitry is not limited to simple excitation or inhibition. Alterations of neural firing patterns and long-term effects on neurotransmitter and receptor systems may also play important roles in the therapeutic effects of brain stimulation. Future research on both the basic and clinical fronts will deepen our understanding of how brain stimulation works. Real-time computation of neural activity allows for integration of brain stimulation signals into ongoing neural processing. In this way abnormal circuit activity can be adjusted by optimal therapeutic brain stimulation paradigms.", "pages": "451-7"}, {"volume": "355", "title": "Short-term high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases human motor cortex excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "14729241", "authors": ["Mima, T", "Oga, T", "Rothwell, J", "Satow, T", "Yamamoto, J", "Toma, K", "Fukuyama, H", "Shibasaki, H", "Nagamine, T"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Several previous studies have shown that periods of changed sensory input can have after effects on the excitability of the corticospinal system. Here we test whether the parameters of peripheral stimulation conventionally used to treat pain with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS: 90 Hz) also have modulatory effects on the motor system. We measured the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by the focal transcranial magnetic stimulation in the right abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous muscles before and after 30 min TENS over the right thenar eminence. In addition, we evaluated tactile and 2-point discrimination thresholds at the same site. TENS transiently reduced MEPs and increased sensory thresholds. This suggests that short-term TENS might have an inhibitory effect on both the sensory and motor systems.", "pages": "451-7"}, {"volume": "355", "title": "Changes in motor cortical excitability in humans following orally administered theophylline.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "14729236", "authors": ["Nardone, R", "Buffone, E", "Covi, M", "Lochner, PG", "Tezzon, F"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The effects of theophylline on human corticospinal excitability were studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after double-blind oral administration of theophylline or placebo in 20 healthy volunteers. TMS measurements included resting and active motor threshold, silent period, intracortical inhibition (ICI), and intracortical facilitation. F-wave and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) were also measured. Theophylline produces a reduction in ICI, while other parameters of corticospinal excitability remained unaffected. Since ICI is thought to depend on GABAA intracortical inhibitory mechanisms, our data suggest that the increase of human motor cortex excitability is the result of a decrease in GABAergic transmission. Our results further support the hypothesis that theophylline might induce convulsions by inhibiting GABAA receptor binding.", "pages": "451-7"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Modulation of associative human motor cortical plasticity by attention.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14724259", "authors": ["Stefan, K", "Wycislo, M", "Classen, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The role of attention in generating motor memories remains controversial principally because it is difficult to separate the effects of attention from changes in kinematics of motor performance. We attempted to disentangle attention from performance effects by varying attention while plasticity was induced in human primary motor cortex by external stimulation in the absence of voluntary movement. A paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol was employed consisting of repetitive application of single afferent electric stimuli, delivered to the right median nerve, paired with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the optimal site for activation of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) to generate near-synchronous events in the left primary motor cortex. In experiment 1, the spatial location of attention was varied. PAS failed to induce plasticity when the subject's attention was directed to their left hand, away from the right target hand the cortical representation of which was being stimulated by PAS. In experiment 2, the grade of attention to the target hand was manipulated. PAS-induced plasticity was maximal when the subject viewed their target hand, and its magnitude was slightly reduced when the subject could only feel their hand. Conversely, plasticity was completely blocked when the subject's attention was diverted from the target hand by a competing cognitive task. A similar modulation by attention was observed for PAS-induced changes in the duration of the silent period evoked by TMS in voluntarily contracted muscle. Associative plasticity in the human motor cortex depends decisively on attention.", "pages": "451-7"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "Transcranial myogenic motor-evoked potentials after transient spinal cord ischemia predicts neurologic outcome in rabbits.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14718841", "authors": ["Murakami, H", "Tsukube, T", "Kawanishi, Y", "Okita, Y"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery", "abstract": "Myogenic transcranial motor-evoked potentials (tc-MEPs) were applied to monitor spinal cord ischemia in the repairs of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.
