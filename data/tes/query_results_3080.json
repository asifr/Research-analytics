Motor evoked potentials had the same latency, amplitude and threshold on both sides of the body, whilst the silent period duration was shorter in the dominant hand. Silent periods elicited by nerve and brainstem stimulation were the same in both hands. Since the latter part of the cortical silent period is due mainly to withdrawal of corticospinal input to spinal motoneurones, we speculate that the results are compatible with the suggestion that tonic contractions of the non-dominant hand are associated with a greater involvement of the corticospinal tract than those of the dominant hand. It also seems likely that there is an asymmetry in the excitability of cortical inhibitory mechanisms with those responsible for the cortical silent period being less excitable in the dominant motor cortex.", "pages": "390-6"}, {"volume": "99", "title": "AC pulsed electromagnetic fields-induced sexual arousal and penile erections in Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-4", "pmid": "10495212", "authors": ["Sandyk, R"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The International journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) since brain dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of sexual behavior. Activation of dopamine D2 receptor sites, with resultant release of oxytocin from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, induces sexual arousal and erectile responses in experimental animals and humans. In Parkinsonian patients subcutaneous administration of apomorphine, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, induces sexual arousal and penile erections. It has been suggested that the therapeutic efficacy of transcranial administration of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla flux density in PD involves the activation of dopamine D2 receptor sites which are the principal site of action of dopaminergic pharmacotherapy in PD. Here, 1 report 2 elderly male PD patients who experienced sexual dysfunction which was recalcitrant to treatment with anti Parkinsonian agents including selegiline, levodopa and tolcapone. However, brief transcranial administrations of AC pulsed EMFs in the picotesla flux density induced in these patients sexual arousal and spontaneous nocturnal erections. These findings support the notion that central activation of dopamine D2 receptor sites is associated with the therapeutic efficacy of AC pulsed EMFs in PD. In addition, since the right hemisphere is dominant for sexual activity, partly because of a dopaminergic bias of this hemisphere, these findings suggest that right hemispheric activation in response to administration of AC pulsed EMFs was associated in these patient with improved sexual functions.", "pages": "390-6"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Imaging of current density and current pathways in rabbit brain during transcranial electrostimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "10493077", "authors": ["Joy, ML", "Lebedev, VP", "Gati, JS"], "year": "1999", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "abstract": "A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method was used for a noninvasive study of current density (CD) and current pathways (CP's) inside the skull during transcranial electrostimulation in rabbits. The transcranial impulse current directions studied were those previously used in transcranial electric treatment either sagittally or bilaterally. MRI data were collected from slices perpendicular to the direction of current application. In these slices, only the perpendicular component of the CD was measured. Computer methods for accurate topographic mapping of the main areas with high CD and for reconstruction of CP's are described. It was revealed that current applied on the head sagittally passed mostly through the cerebrospinal fluid in the basal brain cisternas connected in series, and through the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles, foramina of Monro, ventrocaudal part of the third ventricle, aqueductus, and fourth ventricle. Possible connections between these CP's are suggested. Bilaterally applied current passed through the brain and skull core more diffusely without concentrations in cisternas and ventricles. The results of the present study suggest an explanation for the observation that sagittally applied current more effectively stimulates brain structures with antinociceptive function and elicits more pronounced analgesic effect.", "pages": "390-6"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Inhibition in the human motor cortex is reduced just before a voluntary contraction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10489033", "authors": ["Reynolds, C", "Ashby, P"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To examine inhibition in the human motor cortex before and during voluntary movements.", "pages": "390-6"}, {"volume": "127", "title": "Comparison of input-output patterns in the corticospinal system of normal subjects and incomplete spinal cord injured patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10489022", "authors": ["Davey, NJ", "Smith, HC", "Savic, G", "Maskill, DW", "Ellaway, PH", "Frankel, HL"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study the patterns of recruitment, with increasing stimulus intensity, and facilitation, with increasing voluntary contraction, in thenar muscles of 12 patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries and 13 control subjects. The patients had all suffered spinal cord injury at a segmental level rostral to C8 and T1, the segments supplying innervation of thenar muscles. The patients showed a less pronounced increase in MEP amplitude with increasing strength of TMS compared with the controls. Specifically, at a stimulus strength of 120% threshold and above, the patients showed significantly smaller MEPs relative to the maximum ulnar nerve M-wave response than the controls. The patients also showed a less steep pattern of facilitation with voluntary drive. The MEP continued to increase up to 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) whereas the controls reached a plateau around 10% MVC. The results indicate that the patients show modified corticospinal recruitment and facilitation of the motoneurone pool. We speculate that the function of the adapted corticospinal system after spinal cord injury might be to regulate and modulate drive to motoneurones originating from segmental and other descending inputs. We discuss how such a modified corticospinal system might be of functional benefit to the patients.", "pages": "390-6"}, {"volume": "122 ( Pt 9)", "title": "Interhemispheric asymmetries in the perception of unimanual and bimanual cutaneous stimuli.
