Some studies have proposed that action observation involves a bilateral network of brain areas, whereas others have suggested left-hemisphere dominance. We explored hemispheric lateralization associated with action observation using transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex devoid of callosal influences. We assessed corticospinal excitability related to observation of finger movements in one split-brain patient and six controls. Results revealed that the left hemisphere of the split-brain patient shows enhanced excitability during action observation, whereas no enhancement was found in the right hemisphere. The controls showed increased excitability in both hemispheres during action observation. Our findings suggest a left-hemisphere dominance for mirror-neuron function in the absence of a corpus callosum.", "pages": "1591-4"}, {"volume": "360", "title": "The Ferrier Lecture 2004 what can transcranial magnetic stimulation tell us about how the brain works?", "keywords": [], "issue": "1458", "pmid": "16147516", "authors": ["Cowey, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique whereby parts of the cerebral cortex and underlying white matter can be excited by a brief electrical current induced by a similarly brief, rapidly fluctuating magnetic field which is itself produced by rapidly discharging a current through an insulated coil held against the scalp. When combined with magnetic resonance structural and functional images of the subject's brain, the stimulation can be directed at specific cortical areas. Over a period of only 15 years, TMS has revealed hitherto unsuspected aspects of brain function, such as the role of distant parts of the brain in recovery from stroke, and has helped to resolve several previously intractable disputes, such as the neuronal basis of conscious awareness. This article describes and discusses the origins and nature of TMS, its applications and limitations, and its especial usefulness in conjunction with other techniques of evaluating or imaging brain activity.", "pages": "1591-4"}, {"volume": "569", "title": "Dissociated effects of diazepam and lorazepam on short-latency afferent inhibition.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "10472196", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Pilato, F", "Dileone, M", "Tonali, PA", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve inputs have an inhibitory effect on motor cortex excitability at short intervals (short-latency afferent inhibition, SAI). This can be tested by coupling electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. SAI is reduced by the anticholinergic drug scopolamine, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is possible that SAI is a marker of central cholinergic activity important for memory function. The benzodiazepine lorazepam also reduces SAI. Since benzodiazepines impair memory formation, but do not do so uniformly, with a maximum amnesic effect after lorazepam but less or no effect after diazepam, we were interested in testing in this non-behavioural study to what extent the effects of lorazepam and diazepam on circuits involved in SAI could be dissociated. In addition, and for control, we tested the effects of lorazepam and diazepam on short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), a motor cortical inhibition mediated through the GABA(A) receptor. Lorazepam markedly reduced SAI, whereas diazepam slightly increased it. In contrast, both benzodiazepines uniformly increased SICI. Our findings demonstrate opposite effects of lorazepam and diazepam on SAI, an inhibition modulated by central cholinergic activity, but the same effects on SICI, a marker of neurotransmission through the GABA(A) receptor. This dissociation suggests, for the first time, that TMS measures of cortical inhibition provide the opportunity to segregate differences of benzodiazepine action in human central nervous system circuits.", "pages": "1591-4"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "A controlled study of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in medication-resistant major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9882091", "authors": ["Avery, DH", "Holtzheimer, PE", "Fawaz, W", "Russo, J", "Neumaier, J", "Dunner, DL", "Haynor, DR", "Claypoole, KH", "Wajdik, C", "Roy-Byrne, P"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a treatment for depression has shown statistically significant effects, but the clinical significance of these effects has been questioned.", "pages": "1591-4"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Stimulation at the cervicomedullary junction in human subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "11600655", "authors": ["Taylor, JL"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology", "abstract": "Patients with medication-resistant depression were randomized to receive 15 sessions of active or sham repetitive TMS delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 110% the estimated prefrontal cortex threshold.

Such stimuli evoke single descending volleys which activate motoneurones and elicit responses in muscles of the upper limb. These responses (cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials, CMEPs) have a large monosynaptic component and can be used to test motoneurone excitability in a variety of tasks. CMEPs can be elicited in resting muscle and during all strengths of voluntary contraction. Examination of CMEPs during and after voluntary contractions reveals changes in motoneurone excitability but also suggests activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of the corticospinal pathway. Because they test the same subcortical pathway as transcranial magnetic stimulation, but are unaffected by altered excitability at a cortical level, CMEPs often offer the most appropriate comparison to allow interpretation of changes in motor evoked potentials.
