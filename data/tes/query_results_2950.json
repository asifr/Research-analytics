In the present study we evaluated the clinical status and the hemodynamic responses during mental work in the prefrontal cortex before therapeutic rTMS. Twelve patients diagnosed with major depression (DSM-IV) were randomized in a sham-controlled cross-over treatment protocol of 4 weeks' duration consisting of two periods of 5 days with rTMS separated by 9 days of no stimulation. rTMS (10 Hz) was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex during mental work were evaluated by multi-site near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) decreased significantly by -5.4 points after 5 days of active stimulation, whereas it did not change (+1.6 points) after sham stimulation. Absence of a task-related increase of total hemoglobin concentrations at the stimulation site (P<0.005), but not at other locations, before the first active rTMS significantly predicted the clinical response to active rTMS. Clinical benefits of rTMS are predicted by low local hemodynamic responses and support the idea of activation-dependent targeting of rTMS location.", "pages": "161-72"}, {"volume": "96", "title": "Temporalis exteroceptive suppression in generalized anxiety disorder and major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11063787", "authors": ["Wang, W", "Fu, X", "Wang, Y"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "The duration abnormality of the exteroceptive suppressions, or silent periods, of peripheral or jaw-closing muscle activities induced by transcranial magnetic or trigeminal electrical stimuli in patients suffering from anxiety or depression is ill-defined.

Surface EMG was recorded from the wrist flexors and extensors together with wrist position. Movements in both directions were characterised by the usual triphasic pattern of EMG activity in agonist (AG1), antagonist (ANTAG) and again in agonist (AG2) muscles. Single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were applied over the motor cortex at an intensity of 80 % of resting threshold at random times between 80 and 380 ms after the cue. We measured the peak-to-peak amplitude of the evoked motor potential (MEP) and the integrated EMG (IEMG) activity that preceded the MEP. In a separate set of experiments H reflexes were elicited in the wrist flexors instead of MEPs. MEP amplitudes in the agonist muscle increased by an average of 10 +/- 8 ms (range -1 to 23 ms) prior to the onset of the AG1 burst and were associated with an increase of over sevenfold in the MEP:IEMG ratio, irrespective of movement direction. Agonist H reflex amplitudes were linearly related to, and increased at the same time as, changes in agonist IEMG. The principal ANTAG burst was not preceded by an increase in the antagonist muscle MEP:IEMG ratio. No relationship was found between the amplitude of the antagonist H reflexes and the preceding antagonist IEMG. Five subjects showed an increase in the MEP:IEMG ratio preceding and during the initial part of the AG2 burst. Our method of analysis shows that changes in motor cortical excitability mediating the initiation of movement occur much closer to the onset of EMG activity (less than 23 ms) than the 80-100 ms lead time previously reported. The lack of such changes before the onset of the ANTAG burst suggests that this may be initiated by a different, perhaps subcortical, mechanism.", "pages": "161-72"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Current orientation induced by magnetic stimulation influences a cognitive task.", "keywords": [], "issue": "14", "pmid": "2489409", "authors": ["Hill, AC", "Davey, NJ", "Kennard, C"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "We studied motor cortex excitability in the nonlesioned hemisphere of patients with a large cortical infarction.

We have postulated that the loss of GABA-ergic inputs from spinal interneurones alone is insufficient to produce tonic firing of motor neurones and that excessive supraspinal excitation could also play a role. To determine whether SPS is associated with dysfunction in supraspinal GABA-ergic neurones, we assessed the excitability of the motor cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in seven SPS patients and seven age-matched healthy volunteers. SPS patients had normal central motor conduction times, normal thresholds for motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in leg muscles, and a normal MEP stimulus versus response recruitment curve with increasing TMS intensities in resting hand and leg muscles. Cortical silent periods were shortened in leg muscles. Intracortical inhibition and excitation were assessed while recording from the abductor pollicis brevis, using a paired pulse TMS paradigm with subthreshold conditioning stimuli. Patients had decreased inhibition and markedly increased facilitation at short intervals. Using paired suprathreshold TMS, patients exhibited increased facilitation at 20- and 40-ms intervals. These results point to a hyperexcitability of the motor cortex in SPS, which could be explained by impairment of supraspinal GABA-ergic neurones, leading to an impaired balance between inhibitory and excitatory intracortical circuitry.", "pages": "161-72"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Acute transcranial magnetic stimulation of frontal brain regions selectively modulates the release of vasopressin, biogenic amines and amino acids in the rat brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "2051195", "authors": ["Keck, ME", "Sillaber, I", "Ebner, K", "Welt, T", "Toschi, N", "Kaehler, ST", "Singewald, N", "Philippu, A", "Elbel, GK", "Wotjak, CT", "Holsboer, F", "Landgraf, R", "Engelmann, M"], "year": "2000", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Direct stimulation of visual cortex can produce illusory flashes of light, called phosphenes.
