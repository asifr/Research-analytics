The inhibition of reflexive saccade triggering is under the control of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The critical time interval at which this inhibition takes place during the paradigm, however, is not exactly known. In the present study, we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interfere with DLPFC function in 15 healthy subjects. TMS was applied over the right DLPFC either 100 ms before the onset of the visual target (i.e. -100 ms), at target onset (i.e. 0 ms) or 100 ms after target onset (i.e. +100 ms). Stimulation 100 ms before target onset significantly increased the percentage of anti-saccade errors to both sides, while stimulation at, or after, target onset had no significant effect. All three stimulation conditions had no significant influence on saccade latency of correct or erroneous anti-saccades. These findings show that the critical time interval at which the DLPFC controls the suppression of a reflexive saccade in the anti-saccade paradigm is before target onset. In addition, the results suggest the view that the triggering of correct anti-saccades is not under direct control of the DLPFC.", "pages": "1381-5"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Anticipatory postural adjustment before bimanual unloading reactions: the role of the motor cortex in motor learning.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "17763984", "authors": ["Kazennikov, OV", "Solopova, IA", "Talis, VL", "Ioffe, ME"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroscience and behavioral physiology", "abstract": "The role of the motor cortex in forming a learned coordination (stabilization of the forearm on unloading) was studied in humans. Subjects maintained a 1-kg weight with the right (postural) forearm, the weight being attached via an electromagnet. Unloading of the postural arm was initiated by the subjects by lifting a similar load with the left arm. In control experiments, lifting of the load did not lead to unloading of the postural arm. Changes in motor cortex excitability were studied by transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the representation area of the right biceps muscle in the motor cortex at the beginning and end of the experiments. Repeated unloading tests showed progressive decreases in the amplitude of the movement of the unloaded forearm, which were accompanied by increases in the anticipatory inhibition of the electromyogram of the biceps muscle of the unloaded arm (learning). Muscle responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation during the learning process showed no significant changes. Analysis of normalized muscle responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (response/baseline) showed that these increased at the end of training and reached a significantly higher level than seen at the beginning of training. These results lead to the conclusion that the motor cortex plays a fundamental role in inhibiting synergies and coordinations which would interfere with the formation of the new coordination during motor learning.", "pages": "1381-5"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Functional vibratory stimulation on the hand facilitates voluntary movements of a hemiplegic upper limb in a patient with stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17762768", "authors": ["Shirahashi, I", "Matsumoto, S", "Shimodozono, M", "Etoh, S", "Kawahira, K"], "year": "2007", "journal": "International journal of rehabilitation research.

In the present study, we examined how PAS over the motor cortex affected a distant site, the somatosensory cortex. Furthermore, the influences of PAS on high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) were investigated to clarify the origin of HFOs. Interstimulus intervals between median nerve stimulation and TMS were 25 ms (PAS(25)) and 10 ms (PAS(10)). PAS was performed over the motor and somatosensory cortices. SEPs following median nerve stimulation were recorded before and after PAS. HFOs were isolated by 400-800 Hz band-pass filtering. PAS(25) over the motor cortex increased the N20-P25 and P25-N33 amplitudes and the HFOs significantly. The enhancement of the P25-N33 amplitude and the late HFOs lasted more than 60 min. After PAS(10) over the motor cortex, the N20-P25 and P25-N33 amplitudes decreased for 40 min, and the HFOs decreased for 60 min. Frontal SEPs were not affected after PAS over the motor cortex. PAS(25/10) over the somatosensory cortex did not affect SEPs and HFOs. PAS(25/10) over the motor cortex caused the LTP/LTD-like phenomena in a distant site, the somatosensory cortex. The PAS paradigms over the motor cortex can modify both the neural generators of SEPs and HFOs.

MEPs were recorded from upper and lower limb muscles in 12 patients (7 m and 5f) affected by ADHSP with spastin mutation (SPG4). We measured: (i) motor threshold (MTh); (ii) total motor conduction time (TMCT); (iii) direct and indirect central motor conduction time (d-CMCT and i-CMCT) calculated by subtracting from the cortical latency those obtained on magnetic spinal stimulation (d-PMCT) and via the F-wave method (i-PMCT); (iv) MEP amplitude (MEP/Mmax ratio%) and (v) duration of the cortical silent period (CSP). Latency, amplitude and persistence of the F-wave obtained with electrical nerve stimulation were also considered; H reflex was also tested from lower extremities. SEPs were recorded from spine and scalp sites following median and posterior tibial nerve stimulation; conventional latency and amplitude measurements were performed. In a comparison with the control group, the MTh recording from lower limbs was significantly higher (67.5 +/- 7.7% versus 52.5 +/- 6.9%), MEPs were absent in one case and showed reduced amplitude in the remainders (22.9 +/- 12.6% versus 66.3 +/- 25.9% of M wave); TMCT resulted to be abnormal (36.5 +/- 3.9 ms versus 27.1 +/- 1.4 ms) and d-CMCT as well as i-CMCT were significantly prolonged (23.1 +/- 3.5 ms versus 13.8 +/- 1.3 ms; and 20.1 +/- 3.4 ms versus 10.6 +/- 1.3 ms, respectively). The CSP, which was normal from the hands, was significantly shortened from the legs and correlated with spasticity scoring (Ashworth scale). Cortical SEPs from lower limbs were abnormal in all cases, whereas SEPs by stimulation of median nerves were normal; F-wave parameters from upper limbs showed no abnormalities, whereas an increased persistence was detected from lower limbs; H reflex amplitudes resulted larger compared with controls. Moreover, shortening of the CSP, being correlated with the Ashworth scale, can be considered an electrophysiological marker of spasticity that seems to arise from impairment of the supraspinal or intracortical inhibitory pathways with an additional contribution of increased segmental motor neuron excitability.
