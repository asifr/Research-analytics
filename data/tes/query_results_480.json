A specially developed EEG system with 10-20 electrode locations was used to record the short latency magnetically evoked potentials. Sixteen normal subjects were stimulated using 10 Hz for the left hemisphere and 1 Hz for the right. The evoked potentials recorded for left sided stimulation were significantly larger than for the right sided stimulation. Further, the stimulation energies, though within the range used clinically for the treatment of depression were insufficient to excite evoked potentials in several subjects.", "pages": "1997-2000"}, {"volume": "2011", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation coil with electronically switchable active and sham modes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22254725", "authors": ["Deng, ZD", "Peterchev, AV"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

A wide range of sham approaches have been implemented but they have various limitations including residual electric field in the brain, inadequate reproduction of auditory and cutaneous sensations, and/or need for electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes. We propose a quadrupole TMS coil configuration that can be electronically switched between active and sham modes. In active mode, the quadrupole coil has electric field characteristics similar to a conventional figure-8 coil. In sham mode, the quadrupole coil compared to the reverse-current sham figure-8 coil has 50% less electric field penetration depth, is 97% more focal, produces 35% less intense field in the brain, and induces scalp electric field characteristics closer to those of active TMS.", "pages": "1997-2000"}, {"volume": "2011", "title": "High frequency oscillations evoked by peripheral magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22254518", "authors": ["Biller, S", "Simon, L", "Fiedler, P", "Strohmeier, D", "Haueisen, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "The analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and / or fields (SEF) is a well-established and important tool for investigating the functioning of the peripheral and central human nervous system. A standard technique to evoke SEPs / SEFs is the stimulation of the median nerve by using a bipolar electrical stimulus. We aim at an alternative stimulation technique enabling stimulation of deep nerve structures while reducing patient stress and error susceptibility. In the current study, we apply a commercial transcranial magnetic stimulation system for peripheral magnetic stimulation of the median nerve. We compare the results of simultaneously recorded EEG signals to prove applicability of our technique to evoke SEPs including low frequency components (LFC) as well as high frequency oscillations (HFO). Therefore, we compare amplitude, latency and time-frequency characteristics of the SEP of 14 healthy volunteers after electric and magnetic stimulation. Both low frequency components and high frequency oscillations were detected. The HFOs were superimposed onto the primary cortical response N20. Statistical analysis revealed significantly lower amplitudes and increased latencies for LFC and HFO components after magnetic stimulation. The differences indicate the inability of magnetic stimulation to elicit supramaximal responses. A psycho-perceptual evaluation showed that magnetic stimulation was less unpleasant for 12 out of the 14 volunteers. In conclusion, we showed that LFC and HFO components related to median nerve stimulation can be evoked by peripheral magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "1997-2000"}, {"volume": "590", "title": "Precise temporal association between cortical potentials evoked by motor imagination and afference induces cortical plasticity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 7", "pmid": "22250210", "authors": ["Mrachacz-Kersting, N", "Kristensen, SR", "Niazi, IK", "Farina, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "In monkeys, the repeated activation of somatosensory afferents projecting onto the motor cortex (M1) has a pivotal role in motor skill learning. Here we investigate if sensory feedback that is artificially generated at specific times during imagination of a dorsiflexion task leads to reorganization of the human M1. The common peroneal nerve was stimulated to generate an afferent volley timed to arrive during specific phases of the cortical potential generated when a movement was imagined (50 repetitions). The change in the output of M1 was quantified by applying single transcranial magnetic stimuli to the area of M1 controlling the tibialis anterior muscle. The results demonstrated that the concomitance between the cognitive process of movement (motor imagination) and the ascending volley due to the peripheral nerve stimulation can lead to significant increases in cortical excitability. These increases were critically dependent on the timing between the peripherally generated afferent volley and the cortical potential generated during the imagined movement. Only if the afferent volley arrived during the peak negative deflection of the potential, were significant alterations in motor cortical output attained. These results demonstrate that an artificially generated signal (the peripheral afferent volley) can interact with a physiologically generated signal in humans leading to plastic changes within the M1, the final output stage for movement generation within the human brain. The results presented may have implications in systems for artificially inducing cortical plasticity in patients with motor impairments (neuromodulation).", "pages": "1997-2000"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "[New neurostimulation techniques in adicctions].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "17714096", "authors": ["Garc\u00eda-Toro, M", "Gili, M", "Roca, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Adicciones", "abstract": "Addiction is associated with changes in brain activation patterns.
