While many centers are now using TMS, little has been done to automate the delivery of planned TMS stimulation for research and/or clinical use. We report on an image-guided robotically positioned TMS system (irTMS) developed for this purpose. Stimulation sites are selected from functional images overlaid onto anatomical MR images, and the system calculates a treatment plan and robotically positions the TMS coil following that plan. A new theory, stating that cortical response to TMS is highest when the induced E-field is oriented parallel to cortical columns, is used by the irTMS system for planning the position and orientation of the TMS coil. This automated approach to TMS planning and delivery provides a consistent and optimized method for TMS stimulation of cortical regions of the brain. We evaluated the positional accuracy and utility of the irTMS system with a B-shaped TMS coil. Treatment plans were evaluated for sites widely distributed about a head phantom with well-defined landmarks. The overall accuracy in positioning the planned site of the TMS coil was approximately 2 mm, similar to that reported for the robot alone. The estimated maximum range of error in planned vs. delivered E-field strength was +4%, suggesting a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility in the planned use of the irTMS system.", "pages": "1519-26"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Consolidation of human motor cortical neuroplasticity by D-cycloserine.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "15199378", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Jaussi, W", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "It has been suggested that figurative language, which includes idioms, is controlled by the right hemisphere. We tested the right hemisphere hypothesis by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to transiently disrupt the function of the frontal and temporal areas of the right versus left hemisphere in a group of normal participants involved in a task of opaque idiom versus literal sentence comprehension. Forty opaque, nonambiguous idioms were selected. Fifteen young healthy participants underwent rTMS in two sessions. The experiment was run in five blocks, corresponding to the four stimulated scalp positions ( left frontal and temporal and right frontal and temporal) and a baseline. Each block consisted of 16 trials-8 trials with idioms and 8 trials with literal sentences. In each trial, the subject was presented with a written sentence, which appeared on the screen for 2000 msec, followed by a pair of pictures for 2500 msec, one of which corresponded to the sentence. The alternative corresponded to the literal meaning for idioms and to a sentence differing in a detail in the case of literal sentences. The subject had to press a button corresponding to the picture matching the string. Reaction times increased following left temporal rTMS, whereas they were unaffected by right hemisphere rTMS, with no difference between idiomatic and literal sentences. Left temporal rTMS also reduced accuracy without differences between the two types of sentences. These data suggest that opaque idiom and literal sentence comprehension depends on the left temporal cortex.", "pages": "1519-26"}, {"volume": "364", "title": "Estimated magnitude and interactions of cortico-motoneuronal and Ia afferent input to spinal motoneurones of the human hand.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15193754", "authors": ["Ziemann, U", "Ili\u0107, TV", "Alle, H", "Meintzschel, F"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The processing of auditory spatial information in cortical areas of the human brain outside of the primary auditory cortex remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the occipital cortex (OC) in spatial hearing using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The right STG is known to be of crucial importance for visual spatial awareness, and has been suggested to be involved in auditory spatial perception. We found that rTMS of the right STG induced a systematic error in the perception of interaural time differences (a primary cue for sound localization in the azimuthal plane). This is in accordance with the recent view, based on both neurophysiological data obtained in monkeys and human neuroimaging studies, that information on sound location is processed within a dorsolateral \"where\" stream including the caudal STG. A similar, but opposite, auditory shift was obtained after rTMS of secondary visual areas of the right OC. Processing of auditory information in the OC has previously been shown to exist only in blind persons. Thus, the latter finding provides the first evidence of an involvement of the visual cortex in spatial hearing in sighted human subjects, and suggests a close interconnection of the neural representation of auditory and visual space. Because rTMS induced systematic shifts in auditory lateralization, but not a general deterioration, we propose that rTMS of STG or OC specifically affected neuronal circuits transforming auditory spatial coordinates in order to maintain alignment with vision.", "pages": "1519-26"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "The value of motor and somatosensory evoked potentials in evaluation of cervical myelopathy in the presence of peripheral neuropathy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "15187647", "authors": ["Chistyakov, AV", "Soustiel, JF", "Hafner, H", "Kaplan, B", "Feinsod, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "A 29-year-old woman presented with mild tetraparesis caused by an intramedullary cervical cord tumor extending from the C-5 to C-6 levels associated with rostral and caudal syrinxes extending to the C-1 and C-7 levels. Transcranial motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring was carried out during tumor resection using high-frequency repetitive electrical stimulation. When the rostral syrinx was opened, the MEP amplitude in the right upper limb suddenly decreased by about 50%. When the caudal syrinx was opened, the amplitude immediately recovered to the baseline. During dissection of the attachment of the tumor, the amplitude decreased again by 70%, and did not recover. The tumor was totally removed. The histological diagnosis was ependymoma. Postoperatively, motor weakness in the right arm deteriorated but gradually recovered. The initial loss of amplitude on opening of the rostral syrinx may have resulted from distortion of the intramedullary pressure that compromised function of the motor tract nearby. Opening of the caudal syrinx normalized the intramedullary pressure and allowed the MEP to recover. Intraoperative monitoring of MEPs is valuable in minimizing injury to corticospinal pathways, but care must be taken in evaluating changes in MEP. Intramedullary spinal tumors with associated syrinxes are not rare, so surgeons should realize that opening of a syrinx can lead to MEP changes.", "pages": "1519-26"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Effects of motor imagery on finger force responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15183398", "authors": ["Li, S", "Latash, ML", "Zatsiorsky, VM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Brain research.

We studied the impact of this drug on long-lasting after-effects of transcranial direct current (tDCS)-generated motor cortical excitability shifts, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited motor-evoked potentials. While anodal tDCS enhances motor cortical excitability, cathodal tDCS diminishes it. Both effects seem to be NMDA receptor dependent. D-CYC selectively potentiated the duration of motor cortical excitability enhancements induced by anodal tDCS. D-CYC alone did not modulate excitability. The potency of this drug to consolidate neuronal excitability enhancements, most probably by stabilizing the strengthening of NMDA receptors, which is a probable neurophysiological derivate of learning processes, makes it an interesting substance to improve cognitive functions.", "pages": "1519-26"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Intracortical inhibition and facilitation upon awakening from different sleep stages: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "15182318", "authors": ["De Gennaro, L", "Bertini, M", "Ferrara, M", "Curcio, G", "Cristiani, R", "Romei, V", "Fratello, F", "Pauri, F", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Magnitude and interactions of cortico-motoneuronal (CM) and Ia afferent input to spinal alpha-motoneurones (MNs) of the human hand are largely unknown. This is, however, an important question, which bears on the cortical versus peripheral-segmental 'interest' in controlling alpha-MN excitation. Alpha-MN excitation can be quantified by estimating the amplitude of alpha-MN compound excitatory post-synaptic potentials (cEPSPs) from single motor unit (SMU) recordings, if certain assumptions about the membrane trajectory are made [Exp. Brain Res. 47 (1982) 33]. Here we recorded 29 SMUs from three different hand muscles (FDI, first dorsal interosseous; ADM, abductor digiti minimi; APB, abductor pollicis brevis) of healthy subjects. Each SMU was tested for CM input by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex, for Ia afferent input by electrical peripheral nerve stimulation, and for the interaction between inputs by paired stimulation timed to arrive coincidently at the alpha-MN. Mean cEPSP amplitude elicited by CM input was larger in the alpha-MNs of the FDI than in those of the ADM or APB, whereas mean cEPSP amplitude elicited by Ia input was larger in the alpha-MNs of the APB than in those of the FDI. Generally, cEPSP amplitude evoked by paired input closely matched the arithmetic sum of the cEPSP amplitudes evoked by the single inputs. In conclusion, alpha-MNs of the human hand can be viewed as linear integrators of CM and Ia excitatory inputs. The weights of these inputs may relate to the specific functions of the different intrinsic hand muscles in skilled finger movements.", "pages": "1519-26"}]
