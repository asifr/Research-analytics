However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects are still unknown. We investigated the effects of long-term rTMS on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cholecystokinin (CCK), and neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) mRNA in rat brain. In situ hybridization revealed a significant increase in BDNF mRNA in the hippocampal areas CA3 and CA3c, the granule cell layer, as well as in the parietal and the piriform cortex after rTMS. BDNF-like immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the same areas. A significant increase in CCK mRNA was observed in all brain regions examined. NPY mRNA expression, in contrast, was not altered. The present results suggest that BDNF may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of rTMS. Furthermore, the rTMS-induced changes in BDNF and CCK expression are similar to those reported after antidepressant drug treatment and electroconvulsive seizures, suggesting that a common molecular mechanism may underlie different antidepressant treatment strategies.", "pages": "205-15"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Beh\u00e7et's disease: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study with 44 patients comparing clinical, neuroradiological, somatosensory and brain-stem auditory evoked potential findings.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "10880809", "authors": ["Stigsby, B", "Bohlega, S", "McLean, DR", "Al-Kawi, MZ"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To compare neurological involvement in Beh\u00e7et's disease as documented by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with clinical, neuroradiological, somatosensory (SEP) and auditory evoked potential (BAEP) findings.", "pages": "205-15"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Effects of chronic levodopa and pergolide treatment on cortical excitability in patients with Parkinson's disease: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "10880793", "authors": ["Strafella, AP", "Valzania, F", "Nassetti, SA", "Tropeani, A", "Bisulli, A", "Santangelo, M", "Tassinari, CA"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Forty-four patients were studied over an 8 year period.
