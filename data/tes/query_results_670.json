The HRV parameters (natural logarithms of LF, HF, and LF/HF) was assessed in 20 healthy men before, and immediately after tDCS and sham stimulation. After anodal tDCS in AG the parasympathetic activity (HF(log)) increased (P<0.01) and the sympathetic activity (LF(log)) and sympatho-vagal balance (LF/HF(log)) decreased (P<0.01), whereas no significant effects were detected in NAG (P>0.05). No significant changes in HRV indexes were provoked by sham stimulation in both AG and NAG (P>0.05). In conclusion, tDCS applied on the left temporal lobe significantly increased the overall HRV in AG, enhancing the parasympathetic and decreasing the sympathetic modulation of heart rate. Consequently the sympatho-vagal balance decreased at rest in AG but not in NAG. Releasing a weak electric current to stimulate selected brain areas may induce favorable effects on the autonomic control to the heart in highly fit subjects.", "pages": "32-6"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Spinal associative stimulation: a non-invasive stimulation paradigm to modulate spinal excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "21524606", "authors": ["Cortes, M", "Thickbroom, GW", "Valls-Sole, J", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Edwards, DJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Repetitive, paired peripheral and transcranial stimulation targeting the cerebral cortex can increase cortical excitability, outlasting the stimulation period.

VEPs have been widely employed in mice to study the visual system in physiological and pathological conditions and are extensively used as animal models of neurological and visual disorders. The present study was performed to evaluate whether mice VEPs could be modulated by tDCS in the same manner as in humans. We describe here the effects of 10 min tDCS (anodal, cathodal or no stimulation) on flash-VEPs in C57BL/6 mice under sevoflurane anesthesia. VEP amplitudes of the first major peak (P1) were analyzed before, at 0, 5 and 10 min after tDCS. Compared with no stimulation condition, anodal tDCS increased P1 amplitude slightly more than 25%, while cathodal stimulation had opposite effects, with a decrease of P1 amplitude by about 30%. After-effects tended to reverse toward basal levels within 10 min after tDCS. These results, suggesting polarity-dependent modulation similar to what described in humans of tDCS effects on VEPs, encourage the use of mice models to study tDCS mechanisms of action and explore therapeutic applications on neurological models of disease.", "pages": "32-6"}, {"volume": "589", "title": "Effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the leg motor area on lumbar spinal network excitability in healthy subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 11", "pmid": "19319509", "authors": ["Roche, N", "Lackmy, A", "Achache, V", "Bussel, B", "Katz, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine whether the changes of the motor cortex excitability induced by muscle fatigue could be affected by prior or subsequent intervention protocol supposed to induce opposing excitability changes. For this purpose we used paired associative stimulation (PAS) method, where peripheral nerve stimuli were associated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex at a fixed interstimulus interval of 25 ms. The PAS protocol used is known to produce a long lasting, long-term potentiation (LTP) like change of cortical plasticity manifested by significant increase in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude. In this study, we confirmed significant MEP size reduction following fatigue, which had been already reported in the literature. When PAS was applied either immediately before or after muscle fatigue protocol, the excitability changes were largely occluded and MEP sizes remained close to baseline levels. However, in spite of the effects on cortical excitability, conditioning with PAS did not cause any change in target fatigue measure, the endurance point, which remained the same as when fatiguing protocol was applied alone. The present results demonstrate that fatigue-related changes in cortical excitability can be modulated by either prior or subsequent excitability promoting activity. They also suggest that muscle fatigue associated changes in motor cortical excitability probably represent non-specific activity-related plasticity, rather than a direct expression of the so-called central fatigue.", "pages": "32-6"}, {"volume": "589", "title": "Specific modulation of corticospinal and spinal excitabilities during maximal voluntary isometric, shortening and lengthening contractions in synergist muscles.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 11", "pmid": "19292910", "authors": ["Duclay, J", "Pasquet, B", "Martin, A", "Duchateau, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Proximal upper limb muscles are represented bilaterally in primary motor cortex. Goal-directed upper limb movement requires precise control of proximal and distal agonist and antagonist muscles. Failure to suppress antagonist muscles can lead to abnormal movement patterns, such as those commonly experienced in the proximal upper limb after stroke. We examined whether noninvasive brain stimulation of primary motor cortex could be used to improve selective control of the ipsilateral proximal upper limb. Thirteen healthy participants performed isometric left elbow flexion by contracting biceps brachii (BB; agonist) and left forearm pronation (BB antagonist) before and after 20 min of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) or sham tDCS of left M1. During the tasks, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in left BB were acquired using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of right M1 150-270 ms before muscle contraction. As expected, left BB MEPs were facilitated before flexion and suppressed before pronation. After c-tDCS, left BB MEP amplitudes were reduced compared with sham stimulation, before pronation but not flexion, indicating that c-tDCS enhanced selective muscle activation of the ipsilateral BB in a task-specific manner. The potential for c-tDCS to improve BB antagonist control correlated with BB MEP amplitude for pronation relative to flexion, expressed as a selectivity ratio. This is the first demonstration that selective muscle activation in the proximal upper limb can be improved after c-tDCS of ipsilateral M1 and that the benefits of c-tDCS for selective muscle activation may be most effective in cases where activation strategies are already suboptimal.
