Non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise towards this end with certain NBS protocols augmenting somatosensory processing and others down-regulating it. Here, we review NBS protocols which, when applied to primary somatosensory cortex, facilitate cortical excitability and tactile acuity (i.e., high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS), intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS), paired associative stimulation (PAS) N20-5 to 0, anodal tDCS), and protocols that inhibit the same (i.e., low-frequency rTMS, continuous TBS, PAS N20-20, cathodal tDCS). Other studies have targeted multisensory regions of the brain to modulate somatosensory processing.

Most of what we know about the functional organization of the visual system is derived from animal experiments or by correlating circumscribed anatomical lesions in patients and their visual perceptual deficits or dysfunctions. However, in the past years, significant achievements have been made in characterizing visual information processing in the human using non-invasive neurophysiological techniques, such as electrical stimulation of the brain. Transcranial direct (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied through the skull was shown to directly modulate the excitability of the motor and visual cortices in human subjects.
