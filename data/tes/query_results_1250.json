Although the technique for estimating \"cortical\" voluntary activation (VA) is valid and reliable for elbow flexors and wrist extensors, evidence that it can be applied to muscles of the lower limb is necessary if twitch interpolation with TMS is to be widely used in research or clinical practice. Eight subjects completed two identical test sessions involving brief isometric knee extensions at forces ranging from rest to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Electromyographic (EMG) responses to TMS of the motor cortex and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve were recorded from the rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles, and knee extension twitch forces evoked by stimulation were measured. The amplitude of TMS-evoked twitch forces decreased linearly between 25% and 100% MVC (r(2) > 0.9), and produced reliable estimations of resting twitch and VA (ICC(2,1) > 0.85). The reliability and size of cortical measures of VA were comparable to those derived from motor nerve stimulation when the resting twitches were estimated on the basis of as few as three TMS trials. Thus, TMS measures of VA may provide a reliable and valid tool in studies investigating central fatigue due to exercise and neurological deficits in neural drive in the lower limbs.", "pages": "186-96"}, {"volume": "120", "title": "Unilateral grip fatigue reduces short interval intracortical inhibition in ipsilateral primary motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19028439", "authors": ["Takahashi, K", "Maruyama, A", "Maeda, M", "Etoh, S", "Hirakoba, K", "Kawahira, K", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study was designed to examine whether exhaustive grip exercise of the left hand affected intracortical excitability in ipsilateral motor cortex.", "pages": "186-96"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Biophysical foundations underlying TMS: setting the stage for an effective use of neurostimulation in the cognitive neurosciences.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "19027896", "authors": ["Wagner, T", "Rushmore, J", "Eden, U", "Valero-Cabre, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "abstract": "Ten healthy male subjects (aged 21-24 years) participated in experiment 1 in which paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test corticospinal and corticocortical excitability in right (relaxed) first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle during the recovery period after exhaustive forceful grip exercise of the left hand.
