Patients with tinnitus underwent six different types of stimulation in a random order: 10-Hz rTMS of LTA, 10-Hz rTMS of mesial parietal cortex, sham rTMS, anodal tDCS of LTA, cathodal tDCS of LTA and sham tDCS. A non-parametric analysis of variance showed a significant main effect of type of stimulation (P = 0.002) and post hoc tests showed that 10-Hz rTMS and anodal tDCS of LTA resulted in a significant reduction of tinnitus.

Temporal and spatial properties of motor cortical plasticity were assessed in patients with writer's cramp using a model of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined repetitive electric stimulation of the median or ulnar nerve (MN or UN) with subsequent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral dominant motor cortex at 21.5 ms (MN-PAS21.5; UN-PAS21.5) or 10 ms (MN-PAS10). Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in 10 patients with writer's cramp and 10 matched healthy control subjects. Following MN-PAS21.5 or UN-PAS21.5 in non-dystonic subjects, motor responses increased if the afferent PAS-component came from a homologous peripheral region and remained stable with a non-homologous input. In contrast, following either MN-PAS21.5 or UN-PAS21.5, both APB- and ADM-amplitudes increased in patients. Compared with controls, this increase started earlier, its magnitude was larger and its duration longer. Following MN-PAS10 in controls, APB-amplitudes decreased, while ADM-amplitudes increased. In writer's cramp, the decrease of APB-amplitudes started earlier and lasted longer. Of note, ADM-amplitudes were decreased, too. LTP-like as well as LTD-like plasticity is abnormal with respect to both gain and spatial organization. These findings may help to develop a pathophysiological model explaining core features of focal dystonia.", "pages": "2221-7"}, {"volume": "174", "title": "Topiramate and cortical excitability in humans: a study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16896986", "authors": ["Inghilleri, M", "Gilio, F", "Conte, A", "Frasca, V", "Marini Bettolo, C", "Iacovelli, E", "Gregori, B", "Prencipe, M", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
