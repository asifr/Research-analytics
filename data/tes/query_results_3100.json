Growing evidence points toward involvement of the human motor cortex in the control of the ipsilateral hand. We used focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the pathways of these ipsilateral motor effects. 2. Ipsilateral motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained in hand and arm muscles of all 10 healthy adult subjects tested. They occurred in the finger and wrist extensors and the biceps, but no response or inhibitory responses were observed in the opponens pollicis, finger and wrist flexors and the triceps. 3. The production of ipsilateral MEPs required contraction of the target muscle. The threshold TMS intensity for ipsilateral MEPs was on average 1.8 times higher, and the onset was 5.7 ms later (in the wrist extensor muscles) compared with size-matched contralateral MEPs. 4. The corticofugal pathways of ipsilateral and contralateral MEPs could be dissociated through differences in cortical map location and preferred stimulating current direction. 5. Both ipsi- and contralateral MEPs in the wrist extensors increased with lateral head rotation toward, and decreased with head rotation away from, the side of the TMS, suggesting a privileged input of the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex to the pathway of the ipsilateral MEP. 6. Large ipsilateral MEPs were obtained in a patient with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. 7. The dissociation of the pathways for ipsilateral and contralateral MEPs indicates that corticofugal motor fibres other than the fast-conducting crossed corticomotoneuronal system can be activated by TMS. Our data suggest an ipsilateral oligosynaptic pathway, such as a corticoreticulospinal or a corticopropriospinal projection as the route for the ipsilateral MEP. Other pathways, such as branching of corticomotoneuronal axons, a transcallosal projection or a slow-conducting monosynaptic ipsilateral pathway are very unlikely or can be excluded.", "pages": "895-906"}, {"volume": "518 ( Pt 3)", "title": "The effect of firing on the excitability of a model motoneurone and its implications for cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "7514479", "authors": ["Matthews, PB"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. To help clarify the use of measurements of 'excitability', a simple model motoneurone receiving noisy tonic background excitation was tested with brief stimuli. Its response was determined from its PSTH (post-stimulus time histogram). The tonic background was varied from well below to well above the threshold for tonic firing. The conclusions should apply to many other neurones. 2. The response of the model to a stimulus depended upon a number of factors, including stimulus strength, synaptic membrane noise and especially whether or not the background drive elicited tonic firing. With the onset of firing, the shape of the stimulus-response curve changed drastically and the model then responded to the smallest stimulus without a threshold. When the drive was subthreshold, increasing the background excitation always increased the response to a given stimulus. However, what happened when the tonic drive exceeded the threshold for tonic firing depended upon the stimulus strength. With weak stimuli, the response increased with the drive to reach a plateau level where it was independent of the background firing rate; this occurred for stimuli comparable in size to the synaptic noise. With stronger stimuli, the response rose to a maximum for very low firing rates, but then decreased by up to 50 % to a plateau for high firing rates. Increasing the membrane noise reduced or abolished the maximum. 3. The model was also used to simulate a monosynaptic conditioning-testing paradigm. The effect of a given conditioning stimulus was then found to change with the onset of firing, including when the strength of the testing stimulus was adjusted to make the size of the test response the same in the presence and absence of firing. 4. The behaviour of real motoneurones can be expected to be at least as complex with the transition from silence to firing, so H reflex and other tests of 'excitability' must then be treated with caution. In particular, as has been observed experimentally, the response of a unit may decrease with increasing background excitation, as well as with inhibition. 5. Transferring the findings to corticospinal neurones makes it unlikely that the magnitude of the descending volley elicited by a given cortical stimulus ('excitability') will always increase with the initial level of cortical activity. In addition, the appreciable threshold for transcranial magnetic stimulation during voluntary contraction suggests that it first excites axons rather than the neural pacemakers.", "pages": "895-906"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Motor evoked potentials in a rhesus macaque model of neuro-AIDS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9507417", "authors": ["Raymond, LA", "Wallace, D", "Marcario, JK", "Raghavan, R", "Narayan, O", "Foresman, LL", "Berman, NE", "Cheney, PD"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of neurovirology", "abstract": "Previous work using bone marrow passaged SIVmac239 (simian immunodeficiency virus) has shown that macrophage tropic strains of this virus enter the rhesus macaque brain early following inoculation (Sharma et al, 1992; Desrosiers et al, 1991; Zhu et al, 1995; and Narayan et al, 1997). As part of an effort to more fully characterize the extent of neurologic impairment associated with SIV infection of the brain, we used transcranial electrical stimulation of motor cortex and the spinal cord to evoke EMG potentials in two forelimb (EDC and APB) and two hindlimb (LG and AH) muscles. The latencies, magnitudes and thresholds of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from nine monkeys infected with neurovirulent SIVmac R71/17E were compared to pre-inoculation records from the same monkeys. Seven of nine monkeys developed simian AIDS within 4 months of inoculation and were euthanized. Two monkeys remained free of AIDS-related clinical illness for over 18 months following inoculation. Six of the seven monkeys with rapidly progressing disease showed post-inoculation latency increases ( > or = 2 s.d. of control) in at least one cortical MEP. Increases in cortical MEP latency ranged from 21-97% in different monkeys. All seven rapidly progressing animals showed post-inoculation increases in at least one spinal cord MEP latency. Maximum spinal cord MEP latency increases ranged from 22-147%. Increases in central conduction time (CCT) ranged up to 204% and exceeded two standard deviations of control in four monkeys. Neither of the two monkeys with slowly progressing disease showed significant increases in either cortical or spinal cord MEP latency or CCT. Only the monkeys with rapidly progressing disease exhibited classic AIDS-related neuropathology, although there was no consistent relationship between the severity of neuropathology and the extent of MEP abnormalities. In conclusion, our results demonstrate clear deficits in the functional integrity of both central and peripheral motor system structures associated with SIV infection and further support the use of SIV-infected rhesus macaques as a model of neuro-AIDS.", "pages": "895-906"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Long-term reorganization of motor cortex outputs after arm amputation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "7813640", "authors": ["R\u00f6richt, S", "Meyer, BU", "Niehaus, L", "Brandt, SA"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To investigate the reorganization of the corticospinal system long after arm amputation at different levels.", "pages": "895-906"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Monitoring spinal cord motor and somatosensory evoked potentials in anesthetized primates.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "7705502", "authors": ["Ghaly, RF", "Stone, JL", "Lee, JJ", "Ham, JH", "Levy, WJ"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed in 15 patients 21 to 65 years after arm amputation at the level of the forearm, upper arm, or shoulder.

The traveling periodic spinal descending MEP to TMS and ascending somatosensory (SEP) to posterior tibial nerve stimulation across the thoracic cord were recorded in 12 cynomolgus monkeys.

A well-defined periodic TMS-MEPs and PTN-SEPs were recorded with high reproducibility and consistency in repeated trials under N2O-methohexital anesthesia. MEP tracing consisted of an initial peak (direct (D) wave), occurring at 2.43 (+/- 0.28) msec followed by subsequent five positive (indirect (I) waves).
