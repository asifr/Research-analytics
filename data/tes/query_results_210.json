Given the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neuroplasticity, the current study tested whether tDCS, using different electrode montages, can increase the neuroplastic effects of mental imagery on motor learning. Eighteen healthy right-handed adults underwent a randomised sham-controlled crossover experiment to receive mental training combined with either sham or active anodal tDCS of the right primary motor cortex (M1), right supplementary motor area, right premotor area, right cerebellum or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Motor performance was assessed by a blinded rater using: non-dominant handwriting time and legibility, and mentally trained task at baseline (pre) and immediately after (post) mental practice combined with tDCS. Active tDCS significantly enhances the motor-imagery-induced improvement in motor function as compared with sham tDCS. There was a specific effect for the site of stimulation such that effects were only observed after M1 and DLPFC stimulation during mental practice. These findings provide new insights into motor imagery training and point out that two cortical targets (M1 and DLPFC) are significantly associated with the neuroplastic effects of mental imagery on motor learning. Further studies should explore a similar paradigm in patients with brain lesions.", "pages": "786-94"}, {"volume": "233", "title": "Comparing the after-effects of continuous theta burst stimulation and conventional 1 Hz rTMS on semantic processing.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23276670", "authors": ["Br\u00fcckner, S", "Kiefer, M", "Kammer, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Our aim was to evaluate continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) as a tool to induce temporary impairment (virtual lesion) in semantic processing. Four groups with 20 subjects each were stimulated. In the three experimental groups the stimulation site was the left superior temporal cortex. Stimulation was either 1Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at 100% resting motor threshold (RMT) or cTBS, with intensities of 80% or 90% active motor threshold (AMT). The TMS-control group was stimulated at the right medial prefrontal cortex with 1 Hz rTMS. After stimulation subjects accomplished a lexical decision task with a duration of about 20 min. In an additional fifth group the lexical decision task was performed without TMS. Reaction times were not influenced by cTBS applied with 80% AMT, but prolonged for about 80 ms with 90% AMT compared to the no stimulation condition. An increase of 140 ms was found after 1 Hz rTMS. The effect lasted for the whole task, but declined from the first to the second half of the experiment. The direct comparison of cTBS and 1 Hz rTMS suggests that both stimulation patterns can induce virtual lesions in the left superior temporal cortex and impair semantic processing. We suppose that cTBS could replace 1 Hz rTMS in this field since the application is faster and it is more comfortable to the subjects.", "pages": "786-94"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Bifrontal tDCS prevents implicit learning acquisition in antidepressant-free patients with major depressive disorder.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23274503", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Zanao, TA", "Ferrucci, R", "Priori, A", "Valiengo, L", "de Oliveira, JF", "Boggio, PS", "Lotufo, PA", "Bense\u00f1or, IM", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The findings for implicit (procedural) learning impairment in major depression are mixed. We investigated this issue using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method that non-invasively increases/decreases cortical activity. Twenty-eight age- and gender-matched, antidepressant-free depressed subjects received a single-session of active/sham tDCS. We used a bifrontal setup - anode and cathode over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. The probabilistic classification-learning (PCL) task was administered before and during tDCS. The percentage of correct responses improved during sham; although not during active tDCS. Procedural or implicit learning acquisition between tasks also occurred only for sham. We discuss whether DLPFC activation decreased activity in subcortical structures due to the depressive state. The deactivation of the right DLPFC by cathodal tDCS can also account for our results. To conclude, active bifrontal tDCS prevented implicit learning in depressive patients. Further studies with different tDCS montages and in other samples are necessary.", "pages": "786-94"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "The electric field in the cortex during transcranial current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23274187", "authors": ["Miranda, PC", "Mekonnen, A", "Salvador, R", "Ruffini, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "The electric field in the cortex during transcranial current stimulation was calculated based on a realistic head model derived from structural MR images. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tissue heterogeneity and of the complex cortical geometry on the electric field distribution. To this end, the surfaces separating the different tissues were represented as accurately as possible, particularly the cortical surfaces. Our main finding was that the complex cortical geometry combined with the high conductivity of the CSF which covers the cortex and fills its sulci gives rise to a very distinctive electric field distribution in the cortex, with a strong normal component confined to the bottom of sulci under or near the electrodes and a weaker tangential component that covers large areas of the gyri that lie near each electrode in the direction of the other electrode. These general features are shaped by the details of the sulcal and gyral geometry under and between the electrodes. Smaller electrodes resulted in a significant improvement in the focality of the tangential component but not of the normal component, when focality is defined in terms of percentages of the maximum values in the cortex. Experimental validation of these predictions could provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the acute effects of tCS.", "pages": "786-94"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "[Transcranial motor evoked potentials monitoring for cerebral aneurysm surgery].", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "23269251", "authors": ["Yamashita, S", "Sasaki, O", "Suzuki, K", "Takao, T", "Nakamura, K", "Koike, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "No shinkei geka.
