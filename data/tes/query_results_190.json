Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Conference", "abstract": "Pain, either acute pain or chronic pain, is usually treated/relieved by chemical means, in which nociceptive signals are blocked from transmitting into the pain registration sites in the brain. However, besides their side effects, chemical means of pain relief are not always effective, causing some serious clinical incidents like anesthesia awareness and chronic pains that are not treatable. A physical means of pain relief that physically modifies pain perception at the brain sites responsible for pain registration could be more effective, for both acute pain and chronic pain. In this paper a novel approach of magnetically induced deep brain modulation of neuronal firing is proposed for pain treatment/relief, in which pain treatment/relief is bioelectronics based and is non-invasive and free of side effects. A novel pulse magnetic field projector has been developed for pain relief through modulation of neuronal firing at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). It is based on the neuroscience findings that pain registration in the brain is closely related to the excitation of nociceptive neurons at the ACC, in which the nociceptive neuronal firing rate increases as pain gets more intense. The mechanism of pain relief in the proposed approach is to modify the nociceptive neuronal firing rate at the ACC by magnetically inducing a pulse electric field applying on the neurons in the ACC, hyperpolarizing the neurons that are firing at high frequency during pain perception, resulting in a low level firing rate associated to no pain. A parametric study has been carried out to determine the physical and technical parameters of the proposed approach. The feasibility of the approach has been verified by simulation with the modulation implemented on a reconstructed ACC LV pyramidal cell using Hodgkin-Huxley style model. Action potentials recorded in the soma indicated that the firing frequency can be modulated by the applied pulse electric field.", "pages": "731-4"}, {"volume": "235", "title": "Temporal association between changes in primary sensory cortex and corticomotor output during muscle pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23357117", "authors": ["Schabrun, SM", "Jones, E", "Kloster, J", "Hodges, PW"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Integration of information between multiple cortical regions is thought to underpin the experience of pain.

Mean MEP amplitudes, map center of gravity (CoG), and stimulus-response characteristics were assessed before and after a 30-min rest session. As a novel feature, subregions of the map were analyzed for regions of highest test-retest reliability for use as a global measure of cortical excitability. Mean MEP amplitudes between sessions were highly reliable (ICC=0.90-0.92). Reproducibility of MEPs was highest along an axis approximately 45\u00b0 to the nasion-inion. Stimulus-response MEP amplitudes showed moderate to high reliability (ICC 0.54-0.95). Mean CoG shift between sessions was 2.79\u00b11.2mm.

Different strategies for electrical modulation of the brain such as Deep Brain Stimulation, Vagal Nerve Stimulation and Transcraneal Magnetic Stimulation have gained considerable interest in the last decade as alternative therapies for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Research into the mechanism of action of the strategies for electrical modulation of the brain suggests a crucial role of different molecules and channels such as glutamate, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, adenosine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, calcium channels, sodium channels as well as extracellular potassium. Electrical modulation of the brain may reduce the overexpression of P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux transporter that reduces the absorption of antiepileptic drugs. Electrical modulation of the brain induces long-term effects associated with beneficial consequences on clinical symptoms observed during the postictal state. In addition, electrical modulation of the brain might also promote the neurogenesis in subjects with pharmacoresistant epilepsy in whom this process is decreased. Targeting the regulatory pathways in charge of the effects of electrical modulation of the brain is discussed as a means to improve its efficacy. Electrical modulation of the brain combined with pharmacotherapy may represent an innovative approach to avoid epileptogenesis, reduce seizure activity, induce beneficial effects during the postictal state, diminish the amount of antiepileptic drugs, and improve alertness, memory and mood in pharmacoresistant epilepsy.", "pages": "731-4"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Modulating human procedural learning by cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "23328908", "authors": ["Ferrucci, R", "Brunoni, AR", "Parazzini, M", "Vergari, M", "Rossi, E", "Fumagalli, M", "Mameli, F", "Rosa, M", "Giannicola, G", "Zago, S", "Priori, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex at an intensity of 1 mA with an electrode size of 35 cm(2) has been shown to induce shifts of cortical excitability during and after stimulation. These shifts are polarity-specific with cathodal tDCS resulting in a decrease and anodal stimulation in an increase of cortical excitability. In clinical and cognitive studies, stronger stimulation intensities are used frequently, but their physiological effects on cortical excitability have not yet been explored. Therefore, here we aimed to explore the effects of 2 mA tDCS on cortical excitability. We applied 2 mA anodal or cathodal tDCS for 20 min on the left primary motor cortex of 14 healthy subjects. Cathodal tDCS at 1 mA and sham tDCS for 20 min was administered as control session in nine and eight healthy subjects, respectively. Motor cortical excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Global corticospinal excitability was explored via single TMS pulse-elicited MEP amplitudes, and motor thresholds. Intracortical effects of stimulation were obtained by cortical silent period (CSP), short latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF), and I wave facilitation. The above-mentioned protocols were recorded both before and immediately after tDCS in randomized order. Additionally, single-pulse MEPs, motor thresholds, SICI and ICF were recorded every 30 min up to 2 h after stimulation end, evening of the same day, next morning, next noon and next evening. Anodal as well as cathodal tDCS at 2 mA resulted in a significant increase of MEP amplitudes, whereas 1 mA cathodal tDCS decreased corticospinal excitability. A significant shift of SICI and ICF towards excitability enhancement after both 2 mA cathodal and anodal tDCS was observed. At 1 mA, cathodal tDCS reduced single-pulse TMS-elicited MEP amplitudes and shifted SICI and ICF towards inhibition. No significant changes were observed in the other protocols. Sham tDCS did not induce significant MEP alterations. These results suggest that an enhancement of tDCS intensity does not necessarily increase efficacy of stimulation, but might also shift the direction of excitability alterations. This should be taken into account for applications of the stimulation technique using different intensities and durations in order to achieve stronger or longer lasting after-effects.", "pages": "731-4"}, {"volume": "226", "title": "Comparing immediate transient tinnitus suppression using tACS and tDCS: a placebo-controlled study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "23314693", "authors": ["Vanneste, S", "Walsh, V", "Van De Heyning, P", "De Ridder, D"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
