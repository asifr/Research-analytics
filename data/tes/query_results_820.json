Therefore, repeated tDCS of the brain with cerebrovascular injury will induce the functional and histologic changes. Sixty-one Sprague-Dawley rats with cerebrovascular injury were used. Twenty rats died during the experimental course. The 41 rats that survived were allocated to the exercise group, the anodal stimulation group, the cathodal stimulation group, or the control group according to the initial motor function. Two-week treatment schedules started from 2 days postoperatively. Garcia, modified foot fault, and rota-rod performance scores were checked at 2, 9, and 16 days postoperatively. After the experiments, rats were sacrificed for the evaluation of histologic changes (changes of the white matter axon and infarct volume). The anodal stimulation and exercise groups showed improvement of Garcia's and modified foot fault scores at 16 days postoperatively. No significant change of the infarct volume happened after exercise and tDCS. Neuronal axons at the internal capsule of infarct hemispheres showed better preserved axons in the anodal stimulation group. From these results, repeated tDCS might have a neuroprotective effect on neuronal axons in rat stroke model.", "pages": "984-90"}, {"volume": "132", "title": "Physical treatments for bipolar disorder: a review of electroconvulsive therapy, stereotactic surgery and other brain stimulation techniques.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "10884477", "authors": ["Loo, C", "Katalinic, N", "Mitchell, PB", "Greenberg, B"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "abstract": "To determine the relationship between quadriceps central activation ratios (CARs) derived from a percutaneous electrical stimulation (CAR(SIB)) and a transcranial magnetic stimulation (CAR(TMS)) in healthy participants.", "pages": "984-90"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Silent period-dentate, edentulous, and patients with craniomandibular dysfunction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12949224", "authors": ["Goiato, MC", "Haddad, MF", "dos Santos, DM", "Garcia, AR", "Zuim, PR", "Zavanelli, AC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "abstract": "Nineteen healthy participants (5 men, 14 women, 23.7 \u00b1 4.8 yrs, 66.8 \u00b1 10.0 kg, and 170.1 \u00b1 7.0 cm) qualified for this descriptive study.
