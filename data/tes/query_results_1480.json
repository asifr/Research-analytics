This review will summarize the latest achievements in the monitoring of the spinal cord during spine and spinal cord surgeries. This overview is based on an extensive review of the literature and the authors' personal experience. Landmark articles and neurophysiological techniques have been briefly reported to contextualize the development of new techniques. This background is extended to describe the methodological approach to intraoperatively elicit and record spinal D wave and muscle motor evoked potentials (muscle MEPs). The clinical application of spinal D wave and muscle MEP recordings is critically reviewed (especially in the field of Neurosurgery) and new developments such as mapping of the dorsal columns and the corticospinal tracts are presented. In the past decade, motor evoked potential recording following transcranial electrical stimulation has emerged as a reliable technique to intraoperatively assess the functional integrity of the motor pathways. Criteria based on the absence/presence of potentials, their morphology and threshold-related parameters have been proposed for muscle MEPs. While the debate remains open, it appears that different criteria may be applied for different procedures according to the expected surgery-related morbidity and the ultimate goal of the surgeon (e.g. total tumor removal versus complete absence of transitory or permanent neurological deficits). On the other hand, D wave changes--when recordable--have proven to be the strongest predictors of maintained corticospinal tract integrity (and therefore, of motor function/recovery). Combining the use of muscle MEPs with D wave recordings provides the most comprehensive approach for assessing the functional integrity of the spinal cord motor tracts during surgery for intramedullary spinal cord tumors. However, muscle MEPs may suffice to assess motor pathways during other spinal procedures and in cases where the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury is purely ischemic. Finally, while MEPs are now considered the gold standard for monitoring the motor pathways, SEPs continue to retain value as they provide specificity for assessing the integrity of the dorsal column. However, we believe SEPs should not be used exclusively--or as an alternative to motor evoked potentials--during spine surgery, but rather as a complementary method in combination with MEPs. For intramedullary spinal tumor resection, SEPs should not be used exclusively without MEPs.", "pages": "248-64"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Cortical excitability in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18032099", "authors": ["Yayla, V", "Oge, AE", "Deymeer, F", "Gurvit, H", "Akca-Kalem, S", "Parman, Y", "Oflazer, P"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To investigate the probable cortical excitability changes in DMD by electrophysiological means.", "pages": "248-64"}, {"volume": "Suppl", "title": "3D realistic head model simulation based on transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "18053763", "authors": ["Yang, S", "Xu, G", "Wang, L", "Chen, Y", "Wu, H", "Li, Y", "Yang, Q"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

We recorded motor-evoked potentials in the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles in response to magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex (MEP) and corticospinal tract (cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials--CMEPs), as well as the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) and maximal M-wave (Mmax) elicited by electrical stimulation of the brachial plexus, before, during, and after the fatigue task. The results showed that although the coactivation ratio did not change at task failure, the MVC torque produced by the elbow flexors declined by 48% (P < 0.01) with no change in MVC torque for the elbow extensors. While the MEP and CMEP areas (normalized to Mmax) of the biceps brachii increased ( approximately 50%) over the first 40% of the time to task failure and then plateaued, both responses in the triceps brachii increased ( approximately 150-180%) gradually throughout the fatigue task. In contrast to the monotonic increase in the MEP and CMEP of the antagonist muscles, the H-reflex of the triceps brachii exhibited a biphasic modulation, increasing during the first part of the contraction before declining subsequently to 65% of its initial value. Collectively, these results suggest that the level of coactivation during a fatiguing contraction is mediated by supraspinal rather than spinal mechanisms and involves differential control of agonist and antagonist muscles.", "pages": "248-64"}, {"volume": "104", "title": "A comparison of central aspects of fatigue in submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17502166", "authors": ["Taylor, JL", "Gandevia, SC"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "abstract": "Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a special repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm, where bursts of low-intensity stimuli are applied in the theta frequency.

The amplitude changes of the N1, N2, and P2 components of LEPs and related subjective pain rating scores of 12 healthy subjects were analyzed prior to and following continuous TBS (cTBS), intermittent TBS (iTBS), intermediate TBS (imTBS), and sham stimulation. Our results demonstrate that all active TBS paradigms significantly diminished the amplitude of the N2 component, when the hand contralateral to the site of TBS was laser-stimulated. Sham stimulation condition had no significant effect. The subjective pain perception also decreased during the experimental sessions, but did not differ significantly from the sham stimulation condition. The main finding of our study is that TBS over SI diminished the amplitude of the N2 component evoked from the contralateral side without any significant analgesic effects. Furthermore, imTBS produced responses similar to those observed by other forms of TBS induced excitability changes in the SI.", "pages": "248-64"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Assessment of sensorimotor cortical representation asymmetries and motor skills in violin players.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "15588604", "authors": ["Schwenkreis, P", "El Tom, S", "Ragert, P", "Pleger, B", "Tegenthoff, M", "Dinse, HR"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "To determine the mechanisms underlying the mirroring of distal movements in both upper and lower limbs present in one individual from birth.", "pages": "248-64"}]
