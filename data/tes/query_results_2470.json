The rapidly changed magnetic field produces electrical currents that activate neurons. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) treatment can cause functional changes in the cortex. The present study clarified the effects of rTMS treatment on behavioral changes in rats, focusing on anxiety by using an elevated plus-maze (plus-maze) test. The effects of rTMS treatment on neurochemical changes during the plus-maze test were investigated by determining the extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex by using in vivo microdialysis. Each rat received rTMS of the frontal brain for 3 days, during which 125 stimuli from five trains in a day were applied at 25 Hz for 1 s with 2-min intervals between trains. Three-day series of (chronic) rTMS treatment caused significant increases in the time spent in open arms and the number of entries into open arms of the plus-maze compared with non-treated and sham-treated rats, which were not observed in 1-day series of (acute) rTMS treatment. Chronic rTMS treatment suppressed the increases in 5-HT levels induced by the plus-maze test, but did not influence the elicited DA levels. These data suggest that chronic rTMS treatment of the frontal brain has anxiolytic effects in rats, which are related to the 5-HTergic neuronal system.", "pages": "5-14"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum evokes late potential in the soleus muscle.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "12767489", "authors": ["Sakihara, K", "Yorifuji, S", "Ihara, A", "Izumi, H", "Kono, K", "Takahashi, Y", "Imaoka, H", "Ogino, S"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuroscience research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a double cone coil placed over the left lateral side of the basal occiput was able to elicit late electromyographic (EMG) responses at the bilateral soleus muscles (SOL) averaged over 30 stimulation events, with a mean latency of approximately 100 ms. These EMG responses were detected using a low frequency bandpass filter with 0.05 Hz magnetic stimulation on ten healthy subjects in standing posture. As magnetic stimulation over the left basal occiput with a double cone coil can stimulate cerebellar structure, this late response seems to be conducted from the cerebellar structure to the SOL via an as yet unknown descending pathway.

This effect is commonly attributed to an inhibition produced at cortical level via a transcallosal route. The present study assessed the reproducibility of the transcallosal inhibition effects in different sessions in healthy subjects. Within- and between-subject variability, relating to interhemispheric differences was also evaluated. A magnetic CS on one hemisphere effectively inhibited EMG responses of the abductor digiti minimi stimulated by a TS delivered over the opposite hemisphere in a range of intervals centered at 12 ms. Even though group effects were reproduced in separate sessions, the high between- and within-subject variability yielded low test-retest correlations. This differentiation forces the definition of reproducibility (or repeatability), as the replication of the same mean curves of EMG reduction, and of reliability, as the between- or within-subject correlations between values of specific EMG measures.", "pages": "5-14"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Safety aspects of chronic low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation based on localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and histology of the rat brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "12765850", "authors": ["Liebetanz, D", "Fauser, S", "Michaelis, T", "Cz\u00e9h, B", "Watanabe, T", "Paulus, W", "Frahm, J", "Fuchs, E"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of psychiatric research", "abstract": "Because repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is capable of inducing lasting alterations of cortical excitability, it represents a promising therapeutic tool in several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, rTMS, especially when applied chronically, may cause harmful effects in the stimulated tissue. To study the safety of chronic rTMS we used a novel small stimulation coil, which was specially designed to treat rats, and investigated brain tissue using in vivo localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and post mortem histological analysis. Histology was based on a modified stereology method in combination with immunohistochemistry applying antibodies against OX-6, OX-42, ED, and GFAP to detect any microglial and/or astrocytic activation 48 h after the last TMS session. Conscious rats were treated with a daily suprathreshold rTMS regimen of 1000 stimuli applied on 5 consecutive days at a frequency of 1 Hz. In comparison with control animals receiving magnetic stimulation over the lumbar spine, quantitative evaluations of cerebral metabolite concentrations by proton MRS revealed no significant alterations of N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline-containing compounds, myo-inositol, glucose and lactate after chronic rTMS. Similarly to the in vivo results, post mortem histology revealed no changes in microglial and astrocytic activation after rTMS. In conclusion, these data provide support for the safety of chronic rTMS. However, they do not exclude acute changes on neurotransmitters systems or other physiologic responses during or directly after the rTMS treatment.", "pages": "5-14"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Add-on rTMS for treatment of depression: a pilot study using stereotaxic coil-navigation according to PET data.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "12765849", "authors": ["Herwig, U", "Lampe, Y", "Juengling, FD", "Wunderlich, A", "Walter, H", "Spitzer, M", "Sch\u00f6nfeldt-Lecuona, C"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of psychiatric research", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is regarded as a potentially new tool to treat depression.

Cortical motor threshold, central conduction time (CMCT), and motor-evoked response amplitude (MEP) after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were studied, and the MEP/M wave ratio was calculated. The data was analyzed in the ALS subjects in groups defined by ADM muscle strength and by the presence or absence of clinical signs of UMN involvement. CMCT was not increased in the ALS or LMN disease groups. The threshold was higher in limbs with both weak ADM muscles and UMN signs. The MEP/M wave amplitude ratio was increased in weak muscles in the ALS patients, notably in limbs with no UMN signs, and also in weak muscles in patients with other chronic LMN disorders. It was frequently decreased in strong muscles. There was no difference between bulbar-onset and limb-onset ALS groups, and there was no correlation between threshold and disease duration.
