Therefore, it has been suggested that rTMS may have beneficial effects on motor performance in patients with movement disorders. However, it is still unknown in what way these effects can be produced. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether rTMS of the motor cortex (15 min at 1 Hz) is able to modify the voluntary movement related cortical activity, as reflected in the Beretischaftspotential (BP), and if these changes are functionally relevant for the final motor performance. The cortical movement-related activity in a typical BP paradigm of five healthy volunteers has been recorded using 61 scalp electrodes, while subjects performed self-paced right thumb oppositions every 8-20 s. After a basal recording, the BP was recorded in three different conditions, counterbalanced across subjects: after rTMS stimulation of the left primary motor area (M1) (15 min, 1 Hz, 10% above motor threshold), after 15 min of sham rTMS stimulation and following 15 min of voluntary movements performed with spatio-temporal characteristics similar to those induced by TMS. The tapping test was used to assess motor performance before and after each condition. Only movement-related trials with similar electromyographic (onset from muscular 'silence') and accelerometric patterns (same initial direction and similar amplitudes) were selected for computing BP waveforms. TMS- evoked and self-paced thumb movements had the same directional accelerometric pattern but different amplitudes. In all subjects, the real rTMS, but neither sham stimulation nor prolonged voluntary movements, produced a significant amplitude decrement of the negative slope of the BP; there was also a shortening of the BP onset time in four subjects. The effect was topographically restricted to cortical areas which were active in the basal condition, irrespective of the basal degree of activation at every single electrode. No changes in the tapping test occurred. These findings suggest that rTMS of the motor cortex at 1 Hz may interfere with the movement related brain activity, probably through influence on cortical inhibitory networks.", "pages": "802-8"}, {"volume": "873", "title": "Altered mechanisms of motor-evoked potential generation after transient focal cerebral ischemia in the rat: implications for transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10915807", "authors": ["Bolay, H", "G\u00fcrsoy-Ozdemir, Y", "Unal, I", "Dalkara, T"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that a long-lasting transmission defect in cortical synapses caused motor dysfunction after brief middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the rat despite rapid recovery of axons. In this experimental study, we have examined the impact of differential recovery of synapses and axons on generation of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) recorded from contralateral paralyzed and ipsilateral unaffected muscles, to gain insight into mechanisms of MEPs recorded from stroke patients by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). MEPs generated by focal electrical stimulation of the forelimb area of motor cortex were simultaneously recorded from the brain stem, contra- and ipsilateral forelimb and contralateral hindlimb muscles in rats subjected to transient MCA occlusion. The effect of ischemia on cortical activity and axonal conduction was differentially studied by proximal or distal occlusion of the MCA. Regional cerebral blood flow changes in the forelimb area were monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry during ischemia and reperfusion. In addition, synaptic transmission within the forelimb area of motor cortex was examined by intracellular and extracellular recording of potentials generated by stimulation of the premotor area. No MEP response was recorded during ischemia. Upon reperfusion: (i) motor axons readily regained their excitability and cortical stimulation caused successive pyramidal volleys (recorded as D waves from the brain stem) and a MEP from contralateral paralytic muscles although synaptic activation of motor pathways was not feasible; (ii) the amplitude of pyramidal volley was increased; (iii) MEPs with a longer latency were recorded from the ipsilateral forelimb. In conclusion, differential recovery of synapses and axons after ischemia may account for some previously unexplained findings (such as preserved MEPs in paralysed muscles) observed in cortical stimulation studies of stroke patients.", "pages": "802-8"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Subdural air limits the elicitation of compound muscle action potentials by high-frequency transcranial electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10912202", "authors": ["Kombos, T", "Suess, O", "Pietil\u00e4, T", "Brock, M"], "year": "2000", "journal": "British journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "High-frequency transcranial electrical stimulation was performed in 8 patients undergoing surgery in the sitting position. Following the opening of the dura of the posterior fossa changes in compound muscle action potentials were observed. These changes were not attributable to surgical manoeuvres at the brain stem or spinal cord, or to anaesthetic changes. In all these cases intraoperative fluoroscopy of the skull revealed a subdural air collection underneath the stimulation electrodes. Such a subdural air collection, not infrequent in patients operated on in the sitting position, limits the application of high-frequency transcranial electrical stimulation as a monitoring technique. It remains unclear if this effect is due to the increasing distance between scalp and cortex and the insulating effect of subdural air, or due to displacement of the motor cortex. The practical importance of this report is derived from the increasing application of intraoperative motor pathway monitoring.", "pages": "802-8"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Remote effects of cortical dysgenesis on the primary motor cortex: evidence from the silent period following transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "10904213", "authors": ["Cincotta, M", "Borgheresi, A", "Guidi, L", "Macucci, M", "Cosottini, M", "Lambruschini, P", "Benvenuti, F", "Zaccara, G"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In cortical dysgenesis (CD), animal studies suggested abnormal cortico-cortical connections.

Stimuli were given during MVCs in four fatigue protocols with different duty cycles. As maximal voluntary torque fell during each protocol, the torque increment evoked by cortical stimulation increased from approximately 1.5 to 7% of ongoing torque. Thus \"supraspinal\" fatigue developed in each protocol. The motor evoked potential (MEP) and silent period in the elbow flexor muscles also changed. The silent period lengthened by 20-75 ms (lowest to highest duty cycle protocol) and recovered significantly with a 5-s rest. The MEP increased in area by >50% in all protocols and recovered significantly with 10 s, but not 5 s, of rest. These changes are similar to those during sustained MVC. The central fatigue demonstrated by the torque increments evoked by the stimuli did not parallel the changes in the electromyogram responses. This suggests that part of the fatigue developed during intermittent exercise is \"upstream\" of the motor cortex.", "pages": "802-8"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on results of the twitch interpolation technique.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "10883010", "authors": ["Urbach, D", "Awiszus, F"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Cranial nerve palsy in cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVT) is rare, its pathophysiology remains unclear, and data from electrophysiological examinations in such patients are missing.", "pages": "802-8"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Further evidence for corticomotor hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "10882998", "authors": ["Naka, D", "Mills, KR"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "We report the case of a 17-year-old woman with familial protein S deficiency who was admitted with extensive multiple CVT.
