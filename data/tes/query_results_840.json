It is widely accepted that ES induces rapid plastic change in the motor cortex. This leads to the exciting possibility that ES could be used to drive cortical plasticity in movement disorders, such as stroke, and conditions where pain affects motor control. This paper aimed to critically review the literature to determine which parameters induced cortical plasticity in healthy individuals using ES. A literature search located papers that assessed plasticity in the primary motor cortex of adult humans. Studies that evaluated plasticity using change in the amplitude of potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex were included. Details from each study including sample size, ES parameters and reported findings were extracted and compared. Where data were available, Cohen's standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated. Nineteen studies were located. Of the parameters evaluated, variation of the intensity of peripheral ES appeared to have the most consistent effect on modulation of excitability of corticomotor pathway to stimulated muscles. There was a trend for stimulation above motor threshold to increase excitability (SMD 0.79 mV, CI -0.10 to 1.64). Stimulation below motor threshold, but sufficient to induce sensory perception, produced conflicting results. Further studies with consistent methodology and larger subject numbers are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. There also appeared to be a time effect. That is, longer periods of ES induced more sustained changes in cortical excitability. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other stimulation parameters such as frequency and waveform. Further research is needed to confirm whether modulation of these parameters affects plastic change.", "pages": "456-63"}, {"volume": "206", "title": "Asymmetrical modulation of corticospinal excitability in the contracting and resting contralateral wrist flexors during unilateral shortening, lengthening and isometric contractions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20730420", "authors": ["Uematsu, A", "Obata, H", "Endoh, T", "Kitamura, T", "Hortob\u00e1gyi, T", "Nakazawa, K", "Suzuki, S"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Corticospinal excitability in the M1 contralateral to the contracting muscle changes depending on the type of muscle contraction. Here, we investigated the possibility that corticospinal excitability in M1 ipsilateral to the contracting muscle is modulated in a contraction-type-dependent manner. To this end, we evaluated MEPs in the resting left flexor carpi radialis (FCR) during unilateral shortening, lengthening, and isometric muscle contractions of the right wrist flexors at 10, 20, and 30% of maximal isometric contraction force. To compare the effects of different unilateral contractions on MEPs between the contracting and resting sides, MEPs in the right FCR were recorded on two separate days. In a separate experiment, we investigated the contraction specificity of the crossed effect at the spinal level by recording H-reflexes from the resting left FCR during contraction of the right wrist flexors. The results showed that MEPs in the contracting right FCR were the smallest during lengthening contraction. By contrast, MEPs in the resting left FCR were the largest during lengthening contraction, whereas the H-reflex was similar in the resting left FCR during the three types of muscle contraction. These results suggest that different types of unilateral muscle contraction asymmetrically modulate MEP size in the resting contralateral homologous muscle and in the contracting muscle and that this regulation occurs at the supraspinal level.", "pages": "456-63"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Modulation of risk-taking in marijuana users by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "20729009", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Zaghi, S", "Villani, AB", "Fecteau, S", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Drug and alcohol dependence", "abstract": "Cognitive deficits that are reported in heavy marijuana users (attention, memory, affect perception, decision-making) appear to be completely reversible after a prolonged abstinence period of about 28 days. However, it remains unclear whether the reversibility of these cognitive deficits indicates that (1) chronic marijuana use is not associated with long-lasting changes in cortical networks or (2) that such changes occur but the brain adapts to and compensates for the drug-induced changes. Therefore, we examined whether chronic marijuana smokers would demonstrate a differential pattern of response in comparison to healthy volunteers on a decision-making paradigm (Risk Task) while undergoing sham or active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Twenty-five chronic marijuana users who were abstinent for at least 24h were randomly assigned to receive left anodal/right cathodal tDCS of DLPFC (n=8), right anodal/left cathodal tDCS of DLPFC (n=9), or sham stimulation (n=8); results on Risk Task during sham/active tDCS were compared to healthy volunteers from a previously published dataset. Chronic marijuana users demonstrated more conservative (i.e. less risky) decision-making during sham stimulation. While right anodal stimulation of the DLPFC enhanced conservative decision-making in healthy volunteers, both right anodal and left anodal DLPFC stimulation increased the propensity for risk-taking in marijuana users. These findings reveal alterations in the decision-making neural networks among chronic marijuana users. Finally, we also assessed the effects of tDCS on marijuana craving and observed that right anodal/left cathodal tDCS of DLPFC is significantly associated with a diminished craving for marijuana.", "pages": "456-63"}, {"volume": "84", "title": "Development of quantitative and sensitive assessments of physiological and functional outcome during recovery from spinal cord injury: a clinical initiative.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4-5", "pmid": "20728509", "authors": ["Ellaway, PH", "Kuppuswamy, A", "Balasubramaniam, AV", "Maksimovic, R", "Gall, A", "Craggs, MD", "Mathias, CJ", "Bacon, M", "Prochazka, A", "Kowalczewski, J", "Conway, BA", "Galen, S", "Catton, CJ", "Allan, DB", "Curt, A", "Wirth, B", "van Hedel, HJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "The ability to detect physiological changes associated with treatments to effect axonal regeneration, or novel rehabilitation strategies, for spinal cord injury will be challenging using the widely employed American Spinal Injuries Association (ASIA) impairment scales (AIS) for sensory and motor function.

The purpose of Stage 1 of the Clinical Initiative was to develop these tools and then, in Stage 2 to test them for reliability against natural recovery and treatments expected to produce functional improvements in those with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).

It is generally believed that such changes in synapses form the basis of neural plasticity. Recently, several techniques, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have been developed to attempt to replicate similar plasticity effects in the brains of conscious humans. However, traditional paradigms of rTMS usually require lengthy stimulation and relatively high stimulus intensity. In light of these problems, a novel rTMS paradigm- theta burst stimulation (TBS) - was developed. TBS is able to produce plasticity-like effects more efficiently and powerfully than traditional protocols. The excitability of circuits within the motor cortex can be modified not only by TBS over the primary motor cortex but also when it is delivered to the premotor area. Moreover, TBS over the premotor cortex modifies aspects of spinal reflexes. Studies using TBS over the motor and premotor cortices provide further understanding of dystonia, and the results also distinguish the different mechanisms of the effects of TBS given to the primary motor and premotor cortices. In addition, some data also support the hypothesis that TBS is a potential candidate technique to help restore damaged motor functions through brain stimulation.", "pages": "456-63"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Impact of the gyral geometry on the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20682353", "authors": ["Thielscher, A", "Opitz, A", "Windhoff, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "The spatial extent of the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on neural tissue is only coarsely understood. One key problem is the realistic calculation of the electric field induced in the brain, which proves difficult due to the complex gyral folding pattern that results in an inhomogeneous conductivity distribution within the skull. We used the finite element method (FEM) together with a high-resolution volume mesh of the human head to better characterize the field induced in cortical gray matter (GM). The volume mesh was constructed from T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images to allow for an anatomically accurate modeling of the gyrification pattern. Five tissue types were taken into account, corresponding to skin, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) including the ventricles as well as cortical gray and white matter. We characterized the effect of the current direction on the electric field distribution in GM. Importantly, the field strength in GM was increased by up to 51% when the induced currents were perpendicular to the local gyrus orientation. This effect was mainly restricted to the gyral crowns and lips, but did not extend into the sulcal walls. As a result, the focality of the fields induced in GM was increased. This enhancement effect might in part underlie the dependency of stimulation thresholds on coil orientation, as commonly observed in TMS motor cortex studies. In contrast to the clear-cut effects of the gyrification pattern on the induced field strength, current directions were predominantly influenced by the CSF-skull boundary.", "pages": "456-63"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Human brain connectivity during single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "20682352", "authors": ["Ferreri, F", "Pasqualetti, P", "M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, S", "Ponzo, D", "Ferrarelli, F", "Tononi, G", "Mervaala, E", "Miniussi, C", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) in the human motor cortex can be measured using a paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) protocol.
