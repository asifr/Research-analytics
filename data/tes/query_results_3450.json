In addition, M and F waves were evaluated by stimulating the median nerve at the wrist. All of the examined subjects showed a clear modification in post-exercise MEP amplitudes, with a mean maximal reduction of 50-60% in comparison with basal values and complete recovery after a period of about 35 minutes. The time course of this phenomenon showed a triphasic pattern: (I) a rapid decrease phase up to the fifth minute; (II) a maximal depression phase for a period of about ten minutes; (III) a slow return to basal values. No significant changes were observed in post-exercise M and F waves. These results show the existence of a reversible modulation of the excitability of the upper motor neuron after rapid repetitive movements. It is likely that this modulation takes place at the level of the motor cortex and that its anatomo-functional substrate is represented by the activation of inhibitory intracortical circuits.", "pages": "S261-3"}, {"volume": "481 ( Pt 1)", "title": "Transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex in man: further evidence for the site of activation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "7853247", "authors": ["Rothwell, J", "Burke, D", "Hicks, R", "Stephen, J", "Woodforth, I", "Crawford, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Compound muscle responses were recorded after repetitive electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve and after transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation in 5 healthy persons. The enlargement of the second response at intervals between 30 and 50 msec is more pronounced after cortical magnetic and electrical stimulation than after peripheral nerve stimulation. This difference is believed to be a result of facilitatory mechanisms involving the summation of effects from conditioning and test stimuli along the entire central motor pathway. The facilitation at 10 msec interval, which is only seen after magnetic, but not after electrical transcranial stimulation could indicate an intracortical mechanism.", "pages": "S261-3"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Prognostic value of transcranial magnetic stimulation in acute stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "8068071", "authors": ["Ara\u00e7, N", "Sa\u011fduyu, A", "Binai, S", "Ertekin, C"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "1. The motor cortex was stimulated electrically (vertex anode; cathode 6 cm lateral) in neurologically normal subjects undergoing surgery for scoliosis, and the evoked corticospinal volleys were recorded from the spinal cord using epidural electrodes. 2. Stimuli > 330 V produced a complex D-wave volley containing three separate peaks, with high-threshold components, 0.8 ms (D2) and 1.6 ms (D3), in advance of the lowest-threshold component (D1). As stimuli increased up to 1500 V, D3 replaced the later components completely, but there was no further latency 'jump'. 3. Brainstem stimulation using electrodes over each mastoid process produced a descending volley that had the same latencies as D3. At threshold, stimulation of the brainstem or spinal cord attenuated the D wave evoked by simultaneous cortical stimulation. 4. It is concluded that transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex at high intensities can access corticospinal neurones at the pyramidal decussation, and that stimulation of the brainstem (and the spinal cord) preferentially accesses corticospinal axons. At threshold, motor cortex stimulation probably activates corticospinal neurones at or near the cerebral cortex.", "pages": "S261-3"}]
