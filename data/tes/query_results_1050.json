Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) at interstimulus intervals (ISI) of approximately 20 ms likely involves central cholinergic transmission and was found to be altered in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Cholinergic and GABA(A) receptors are involved in mediating SAI. The effects of SAI on other intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits have not been examined. The objective of the present study is to test how SAI interacts with long interval cortical inhibition (LICI), a cortical inhibitory circuit likely mediated by GABA(B) receptors. We studied 10 healthy volunteers. Surface electromyogram was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. SAI was elicited by median nerve stimulation at the wrist followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at ISI of N20 somatosensory evoked potential latency + 3 ms. The effects of different test motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes (0.2, 1, and 2 mV) were examined for LICI and SAI. Using paired and triple-pulse paradigms, the interactions between SAI and LICI were investigated. Both LICI and SAI decreased with increasing test MEP amplitude. Afferent stimulation that produced SAI decreased LICI. Thus, the present findings suggest that LICI and SAI have inhibitory interactions.", "pages": "277-83"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Electrical stimulation as a means for achieving recovery of function in stroke patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19713618", "authors": ["Popovi\u0107, DB", "Sinkaer, T", "Popovi\u0107, MB"], "year": "2009", "journal": "NeuroRehabilitation", "abstract": "Transcranial stimulation techniques have revealed homeostatic-like metaplasticity in the hand area of the human primary motor cortex (M1(HAND)) that controls stimulation-induced changes in corticospinal excitability. Here we combined two interventional protocols that induce long-term depression (LTD)-like or long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in left M1(HAND) through different afferents. We hypothesized that the left M1(HAND) would integrate LTP- and LTD-like plasticity in a homeostatic fashion. In ten healthy volunteers, low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMD) was first applied to produce an LTP-like increase (5 Hz rTMS) or LTD-like decrease (1 Hz rTMS) in corticospinal excitability in left M1(HAND) via premotor-to-motor inputs. Following PMD rTMS, paired-associative stimulation (PAS) was applied to the right median nerve and left M1(HAND) to induce spike-time-dependent plasticity in sensory-to-motor inputs to left M1(HAND). We adjusted the interstimulus interval to the N20 latency of the median nerve somatosensory-evoked cortical potential to produce an LTP-like increase (PAS(N20+2ms)) or an LTD-like decrease (PAS(N20-5ms)) in corticospinal excitability. The amplitude of motor-evoked potentials was recorded from intrinsic hand muscles to assess stimulation-induced changes in corticospinal excitability. Premotor-to-motor preconditioning triggered a homeostatic response to subsequent sensory-to-motor PAS. After facilitatory 5 Hz rTMS, \"facilitatory\" PAS(N20+2ms) suppressed corticospinal excitability. Likewise, \"inhibitory\" PAS(N20-5ms) facilitated corticospinal excitability after \"inhibitory\" 1 Hz rTMS. There was a negative linear relationship between the excitability changes induced by PMD rTMS and those elicited by subsequent PAS. Excitability changes were not paralleled by changes in performance during a finger-tapping task. These results provide evidence for a homeostatic response pattern in the human M1(HAND) that integrates acute plastic changes evoked through different \"input channels.\"", "pages": "277-83"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Abnormal parieto-motor connectivity in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19713078", "authors": ["D'Argenzio, L", "Koch, G", "Bombardieri, R", "Mori, F", "Moavero, R", "Centonze, D", "Curatolo, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "To determine whether monitoring facial nerve motor-evoked potentials (FNMEPs) elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation during microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS) is useful for predicting postoperative outcome.", "pages": "277-83"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Prior intention can locally tune inhibitory processes in the primary motor cortex: direct evidence from combined TMS-EEG.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "19712104", "authors": ["Bonnard, M", "Spieser, L", "Meziane, HB", "de Graaf, JB", "Pailhous, J"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The authors analysed FNMEP findings in 25 patients with HFS.
