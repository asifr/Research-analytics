The central motor commands therefore must adjust depending on the task performed. Muscle potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) change during the course of fatiguing muscle activity, which demonstrates activity changes in cortical or spinal networks during fatiguing exercise. Here, we investigate cortical mechanisms that are actively involved in driving the contracting muscles.", "pages": "317-26"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Electroporation of cells using EM induction of ac fields by a magnetic stimulator.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20124654", "authors": ["Chen, C", "Evans, JA", "Robinson, MP", "Smye, SW", "O'Toole, P"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "abstract": "During a sustained submaximal contraction (30% of maximal voluntary contraction) of the elbow flexor muscles we applied TMS over the motor cortex.

Although many in vivo electroporation protocols entail applying square wave or monotonically decreasing pulses via needles or electrode plates, relatively few have explored the use of pulsed ac fields. Following our previous study, which established the effectiveness of ac fields for electroporating cell membranes, a primary/secondary coil system was constructed to produce sufficiently strong electric fields by electromagnetic induction. The primary coil was formed from the applicator of an established transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system, while the secondary coil was a purpose-built device of a design which could eventually be implanted into tissue. The effects of field strength, pulse interval and cumulative exposure time were investigated using microscopy and flow cytometry. Results from experiments on concentrated cell suspensions showed an optimized electroporation efficiency of around 50%, demonstrating that electroporation can be practicably achieved by inducing such pulsed ac fields. This finding confirms the possibility of a wide range of in vivo applications based on magnetically coupled ac electroporation.", "pages": "317-26"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Modulation of decision-making in a gambling task in older adults with transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "20105234", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Campanh\u00e3, C", "Valasek, CA", "Fecteau, S", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive and painless technique for studying the motor pathways in medical neurology.
