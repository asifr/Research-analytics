Weak anodal cortical stimuli are known to activate preferentially fast-conducting pyramidal axons directly, bypassing cell bodies and cortical interneurons. A narrow bin width (0.1 ms) was chosen to measure precisely the duration of the PSTH excitatory peak, which corresponds to the rise time of the underlying compound excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP). A short duration PSTH peak indicates sharp-rising EPSPs, most commonly encountered in the case of monosynaptic connections. In flexor carpi radialis and soleus SMUs, the PSTHs of built-in responses to anodal cortical stimuli were compared with those produced by 1A afferent stimulation able to elicit a Hoffmann reflex, which is known to be largely monosynaptic. In all upper and lower limb muscles, excitable SMUs responded to anodal cortical stimuli with a highly synchronized peak of increased firing probability. In flexor carpi radialis and soleus SMUs, the mean duration of this peak was significantly narrower than that evoked by 1A afferent stimulation, indicating that monosynaptic corticomotor neuronal transmission dominates low-threshold motor units, even in proximal arm and leg muscles. In the various muscles studied, and particularly in forearm SMUs, we did not observe broad PSTH peaks against the activation of non-monosynaptic corticomotor neuronal pathways, even with near-threshold stimuli. In some triceps and forearm flexor SMUs, subthreshold anodal pulses caused significant inhibition of their voluntary firing, with a latency consistent with activation of 1A inhibitory interneurons by the descending volleys. Measurements of the maximal number of counts in the excitatory PSTH peak upon anodal cortical stimuli provide comparisons of the strength of monosynaptic inputs to various muscles which seems to be maximal for hand and finger extensor muscles, and also for deltoid.", "pages": "2209"}, {"volume": "122 ( Pt 7)", "title": "Corticomotoneuronal synaptic connections in normal man: an electrophysiological study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10388798", "authors": ["de Noordhout, AM", "Rapisarda, G", "Bogacz, D", "G\u00e9rard, P", "De Pasqua, V", "Pennisi, G", "Delwaide, PJ"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "During spinal cord monitoring, motor responses in the tibialis anterior muscles were recorded on transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex.

A possible mechanism for the Jendrassik maneuver (JM) is that induced proprioceptive input ascends supraspinally to facilitate the descending volleys. In order to mimic the JM with a more controlled influence, we used an electrical conditioning (C) stimulation (4 times sensory threshold) delivered to the left index finger preceding the transcranial (T) magnetic stimulation at C-T intervals of 0-200 ms. The MEP facilitation of bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GC) was within C-T 70-110 ms. The peak facilitation was at C-T 80 ms for ipsilateral TA (309%) and GC (405%) and at C-T 90 ms for contralateral TA (207%) and GC (283%). In the two thalamic infarction patients with right-sided sensory loss, the facilitation did not occur when the conditioning stimulation was delivered to the affected index finger. Therefore, it is likely that the peripheral volley must be transmitted supraspinally to facilitate MEPs of the lower limbs. This method for studying sensory facilitation is more quantitative and reproducible than the JM and technically better than other previously described methods for somatosensory conditioning.", "pages": "2209"}, {"volume": "517 ( Pt 2)", "title": "Differential effects on motorcortical inhibition induced by blockade of GABA uptake in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "2477417", "authors": ["Werhahn, KJ", "Kunesch, E", "Noachtar, S", "Benecke, R", "Classen, J"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "We have assessed a technique to stimulate the intracranial hypoglossal nerve with ease and reproducibility by using magnetic coils (MCs) and to detect a reliable site of excitation in animal experiments in order to establish a method to evaluate the motor pathway to lingual muscles.", "pages": "2209"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Determination of cognitive hemispheric lateralization by \"functional\" transcranial Doppler cross-validated by functional MRI.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "3051620", "authors": ["Schmidt, P", "Krings, T", "Willmes, K", "Roessler, F", "Reul, J", "Thron, A"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "We recorded the motor responses from the lingual muscles of 5 adult cats under general anesthesia by magnetic and electrical stimulation of the intracranial hypoglossal nerves.
