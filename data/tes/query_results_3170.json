MEPs were recorded from the relaxed abductor digiti muscle. Three peaks of MEP facilitation were consistently observed at interstimulus intervals of 1.1-1.5 ms, 2.3-2.7 ms, and 3.9-4.5 ms. The size of these MEP peaks was transiently suppressed by drugs which enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function in the neocortex (lorazepam, vigabatrin, phenobarbital, ethanol), while the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen, anti-glutamate drugs (gabapentin, memantine), and sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine) had no effect. The interstimulus intervals effective for the production of the MEP peaks remained unaffected by all drugs. The MEP peaks are thought to be due to a facilitatory interaction of I-(indirect) waves in the motor cortex. Therefore, the present results indicate that the production of I-waves is primarily controlled by GABA related neuronal circuits. The potential relevance of this non-invasive paired TMS protocol for the investigation of I-waves in patients with neurological disease will be discussed.", "pages": "369-75"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Increased excitability of the human corticospinal system with hyperventilation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9741801", "authors": ["Seyal, M", "Mull, B", "Gage, B"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "We recorded motor responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the masseter muscles of 30 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 10 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and 22 age-matched normal controls.
