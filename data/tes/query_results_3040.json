Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TCMS) was used to determine the organization of cortical motor projections to the anterior digastric muscles in 12 normal human subjects. Two distinct types of potentials were evoked in anterior digastric with a figure-of-eight coil. A short-latency (3 ms) response appeared bilaterally on the surface electromyogram (EMG), but only ipsilaterally on intramuscular recordings: this was the result of direct stimulation of the ipsilateral trigeminal motor root. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in the anterior digastric muscles at variable onset latencies of around 10 ms by stimulation of scalp areas antero-lateral to the area for the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand. These were evoked bilaterally in relaxed anterior digastric muscles in six of the seven subjects. In the other subject, the responses in the relaxed muscle were exclusively ipsilateral. However, when the anterior digastric muscles were contracted, the responses were bilateral in all subjects. TCMS and spike-triggered averaging revealed that the bilateral responses were not due to the branching of axons from individual digastric motoneurones to muscles on each side. Because the digastric motor nucleus may contain separate populations of ipsi- and contralateral projecting motoneurones, it was necessary to study single motor-unit responses to TCMS to demonstrate a bilateral corticobulbar projection. The responses of 17 single motor units in the anterior digastric muscle to TCMS were recorded. All were activated by contralateral stimulation. Approximately 80% were also activated by ipsilateral TCMS, although one well-characterised motor unit was inhibited by ipsilateral TCMS. When bilateral activation was present, the ipsilateral responses were more secure than the contralateral responses, which may indicate an additional interneurone in the pathway to the contralateral motoneurone. The major conclusions from this study are that (1) the cortical representation of the anterior digastric muscle is antero-lateral to hand muscles; (2) the cortical projection to the anterior digastric muscles is bilateral; (3) the corticobulbar projection is stronger contralaterally than ipsilaterally but may involve at least one additional synapse; and (4) anterior digastric motoneurones do not branch to innervate the muscles bilaterally.", "pages": "582-91"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "The contribution of fast corticospinal input to the voluntary activation of proximal muscles in normal subjects and in stroke patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10638430", "authors": ["Turton, A", "Lemon, RN"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Although it is well known that the corticospinal system exerts more influence over distal (hand and fingers) than proximal (elbow and shoulder) upper limb muscles, differences in the importance of this system for voluntary activation of these muscle groups have not been demonstrated directly. Two investigations were carried out to provide a quantitative comparison of the contribution of fast corticospinal inputs to voluntary activity in proximal and distal muscles of normal subjects. The first study confirmed that the rate of increase in the amplitude of EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with voluntary activation of the muscles was significantly greater in a hand muscle (first dorsal interosseous, 1DI) than in biceps, which was in turn greater than that for deltoid. The second study demonstrated that this result reflected a genuine difference in corticospinal influence over these muscles and was not due to differences in the pattern and type of motor unit recruitment in proximal vs distal muscles. The voluntary activation of a pair of low-threshold single motor units (SMUs) in 1DI and deltoid was compared with their response to TMS. In both muscles only a small amount of additional effort was required to recruit the second SMU; increments were typically within 1% of maximum voluntary contraction, as assessed from EMG measurements. Subjects were asked to voluntarily discharge the lower threshold SMU at a steady rate, and then the threshold of responses of this SMU and that of the second unit to TMS were determined. In 1DI, only small increments in TMS intensity above the threshold for the first SMU were required to activate the second unit [mean 1.4% maximum stimulator output (MSO), SD +/- 1.0%, n = 7 subjects]. In contrast, in deltoid a significantly greater intensity increase was needed (mean 6%, SD +/- 1.2%, MSO n = 7, P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained when TMS thresholds of motor unit pairs were assessed in relaxed subjects. These experiments support the hypothesis that the fast corticospinal input that can be activated by TMS is of greater importance for the voluntary activation of hand than of shoulder muscles. This hypothesis served as a basis for testing deltoid responses in three stroke patients. In two patients smaller responses to TMS were obtained on the affected side than on the unaffected side during the production of equivalent voluntary contractions, suggesting that the patients achieved these contractions using inputs other than the fast corticospinal elements excited by TMS.", "pages": "582-91"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "Intracortical origin of the short latency facilitation produced by pairs of threshold magnetic stimuli applied to human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10638423", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Rothwell, JC", "Oliviero, A", "Profice, P", "Insola, A", "Mazzone, P", "Tonali, P"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

This occurs with interstimulus intervals of around 1.3, 2.5 and 4.3 ms and could be due to interaction between the responses to each stimulus at either the cortex or spinal cord. We recorded the descending volleys set up by such pairs of stimuli from the cervical epidural space of five patients implanted with chronic stimulators for pain control. Interstimulus intervals of 1, 1.2, 1.4 and 2 ms were used to investigate the first peak of facilitation. Enhanced EMG responses occurred after pairs of stimuli at 1, 1.2 and 1.4 ms, and these were accompanied by larger and more numerous descending volleys than expected from the sum of each stimulus alone. We conclude that facilitatory interaction between the stimuli can occur within the cerebral cortex.
