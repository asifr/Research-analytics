In a first series three different cortical magnetic stimuli were applied: over C3, C4 and Fz (10/20 system), in a second series additionally over Pz. We also used a stimulus over the brachial plexus and a sham stimulus. Five stimuli of each location were applied with a Cadwell high speed magnetic stimulator using a focal point circular coil. Stimulus train duration was 500 ms, stimulus frequency 20 Hz. Stimulus strength was 70-90% of maximum stimulator output, 20% of maximum stimulator output above subjects' individual motor threshold. The subjects assessed stimulus inconvenience immediately after stimulation. ECG and blood pressure (Finapres) were recorded continuously during the 1 h test. In all subjects there was a clearly marked autonomic response with heart rate acceleration and decrease in blood pressure after all stimuli. There was no difference in responses between cortical stimuli. Blood pressure decrease after sham stimulation was significantly smaller than after cortical stimulation, it was more marked after brachial plexus stimulation. Autonomic reaction correlates well with subjective estimation of stimulus inconvenience. We conclude the observed effect of rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation to be associated to rather an unspecific arousal reaction than to a direct stimulation of autonomic cortex areas. We did not observe any clinically relevant side-effects.", "pages": "207-12"}, {"volume": "120 ( Pt 5)", "title": "Comparison of activation of corticospinal neurons and spinal motor neurons by magnetic and electrical transcranial stimulation in the lumbosacral cord of the anaesthetized monkey.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9183254", "authors": ["Edgley, SA", "Eyre, JA", "Lemon, RN", "Miller, S"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "To illuminate the action of non-invasive stimuli on the human cerebral cortex, responses of corticospinal axons and of plantar alpha-motor neurons following transcranial magnetic (TMS) and electrical stimulation (TES) were recorded in the lumbosacral cord in the anaesthetized macaque monkey. A round coil was used for TMS, and the anode was located at the vertex for TES. The responses of 175 identified corticospinal axons (conduction velocities of 24-95 m/s) were recorded from the lateral corticospinal tract at the T12-L3 spinal level. A single magnetic or electrical stimulus could evoke an early spike corresponding to the direct (D) wave in surface recorded volleys and was termed a D response. In the same axon, up to four further spikes, termed indirect (I) responses, could also be evoked. At a given intensity of stimulation, D responses had clear thresholds and fixed latencies, whereas I responses were labile in both respects. For TMS and TES, the thresholds of both D and I responses were inversely correlated with axonal conduction velocity. For TMS, fast conducting axons (> 75 m/s) had lower thresholds for D responses, while more slowly conducting axons (< 55 m/s) had lower thresholds for I responses. Very few of the axons with a conduction velocity of < 40 m/s (three out of 23) gave a D response to TMS. For TES, the majority of axons had lower thresholds for D responses or a similar threshold for both D and I responses. At threshold, the latencies of D responses evoked by TMS and TES were consistent with activation within the cortex, while TES also excited some corticospinal axons deep to the cortex. At 2.5 times threshold for the D response, TMS still excited axons mostly within the cortex, but with TES the site of activation shifted by as much as 65 mm below the cortex (mode 20 mm). Intracellular responses were recorded in 23 plantar alpha motor neurons supplying intrinsic muscles of the foot. All showed monosynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) to both TMS and TES with no significant differences in the rise times of the evoked EPSPs. At threshold for a surface corticospinal volley, the average EPSP to TES began 0.5 ms earlier than that to TMS, and 1.0 ms earlier at 2.5 times this threshold. The different sites of activation of corticospinal neurons by TMS and TES, as well as the different distribution of D and I responses that they evoke, may both contribute to the differences in the onset latencies of the EMG responses evoked by these methods in human subjects.", "pages": "207-12"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation: complementary approaches in the evaluation of cortical motor function.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "9153482", "authors": ["Krings, T", "Buchbinder, BR", "Butler, WE", "Chiappa, KH", "Jiang, HJ", "Cosgrove, GR", "Rosen, BR"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) represent different approaches to mapping the motor cortex. fMRI identifies areas of hemodynamic changes during task performance while TMS provides electrophysiologic data concerning the localization and density of cortical motoneurons.

We performed fMRI at 1.5 T on 3 normal subjects and 2 patients with mass lesions near the central sulcus using a multislice, asymmetric, spin-echo, echo-planar pulse sequence during the performance of a motor task. We also performed focal TMS with surface EMG recordings from the muscles primarily involved in the fMRI task.

The decrease in cortical excitability lasted for at least 15 minutes after the end of the 0.9 Hz stimulation. The mechanism underlying this decrease in excitability may be similar to LTD. TMS-induced reduction of cortical excitability has potential clinical applications in diseases such as epilepsy and myoclonus.

Therefore, patients need to undergo a diagnostic procedure to assess the intradural status of the spinal roots. Although motor recovery is the main goal of brachial plexus surgery, the techniques currently applied do not permit adequate evaluation of the anterior root. In search of an alternative, we performed intraoperative motor evoked potentials. Ninety spinal nerves in 19 patients suffering from brachial plexus lesions were dissected. Twenty-seven spinal nerves were avulsed; 8 nerves were disrupted and 17 were completely scarred, resulting in 25 stumps. Thirty-eight nerves appeared to be undamaged. On central stimulation, nerve compound action potentials were recorded from the exposed spinal nerves. Nerve compound action potentials could only be recorded from 21 stumps and from 32 apparently undamaged nerves. No recordings were obtained from 4 stumps and 7 spinal nerves in continuity. According to these findings, it is highly probable that surgery would have been insufficient in 10 spinal nerves if intraoperative motor evoked potentials had not been performed. We conclude that (1) intraoperative motor evoked potentials are an effective means for investigating the functional status of anterior motor roots and motor fibers in exposed spinal nerves, and (2) the use of motor evoked potentials should be considered during brachial plexus surgery to improve interventions.", "pages": "207-12"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Responses of human single motor units to transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9152201", "authors": ["Garland, SJ", "Miles, TS"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCPs) from the cervical and high thoracic epidural space following transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded from eight subjects in awake and anesthetized condition. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles were simultaneously recorded during voluntary contraction. The stimulus intensity was at 30% above the MEPs threshold of the ADM when the coil center was fixed on 10-20 international Cz position. In awake condition, multiple ESCP components (greater than 3) were recorded from the cervical epidural space but no or minimal components were recorded from the upper thoracic epidural space. When the coil was moved anteriorly so that the posterior edge of the coil was positioned on Cz, the amplitude of the first ESCP component was significantly increased (P < 0.02) and shortened (not significant) at cervical levels. In addition, several ESCP components were more evident at high thoracic levels. Although the amplitude of the ADM was not enhanced, that of the RF was enhanced. During general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics (sevoflurane), only the first component of the ESCPs (D-wave) was elicited. Its amplitude was enhanced (P < 0.02) when the coil edge was fixed on Cz, similar to results in awake condition. This enhancement of the first ESCP component was accompanied by enhancement of those recorded from the high thoracic epidural space. However the amplitude of D-wave was the same in the two different coil positions when the stimulus intensity was set a 100% of the output. These results suggest that at low stimulus intensity, positioning the coil edge on Cz is optimal in inducing D-wave effectively but at high stimulus intensity, D-wave generation can be achieved in either if the two different coil position.", "pages": "207-12"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Effects of transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation on reciprocal inhibition in the human arm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "9152200", "authors": ["Mercuri, B", "Wassermann, EM", "Ikoma, K", "Samii, A", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial electromagnetic brain stimuli elicit a complex response in the electromyogram of active human hand muscles. Relatively weak stimuli evoke a short-latency primary response via a presumably monosynaptic corticospinal path. This is followed by a silent period that is terminated by a second peak at a latency of 50-80 ms. The responses evoked in single motor units in flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) were recorded. Responses were elicited at the second-peak latency only in trials in which no primary response was elicited in that unit, and only when the stimulus was given during the first half of the interspike interval (ISI). When given during the second half of the ISI, the same stimulus evoked a primary response but no second peak response. Stronger stimuli suppressed the second peak by evoking a primary response in more trials. Having discharged at about 20 ms latency, the parent motoneurone was unable to discharge again at second-peak latency, 30-60 ms later. The response at second-peak latency was not modified by disengaging both FDP and the extensors of the distal interphalangeal joint. Hence, this response is not secondary to a stretch reflex provoked by activation of the finger extensors, nor is it the result of a cutaneous signal resulting from movement of the finger. The latencies suggest that the corticospinal volley evokes a beta-motoneurone-mediated twitch in FDP muscle spindles, which elicits an afferent volley that activates the motoneurone reflexly. The first 100 ms or so of the silent period is due to the realignment of the first post-stimulus spike in most trials to corticospinal latency; i.e. this is not necessarily the result of an inhibitory or disfacilitatory process. Still stronger stimuli increase the duration of the ISI in which the stimulus is given, indicating the presence of an inhibitory/disfacilitatory process.", "pages": "207-12"}]
