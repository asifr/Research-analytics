The assessment was conducted using a passive high-resolution finite element head model with inhomogeneous and variable anisotropic conductivities derived from the diffusion tensor data. Electric field distribution was evaluated across different cortical as well as subcortical regions under four bicephalic electrode configurations. Results indicate that regional tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy cause the pattern of induced fields to vary in orientation and strength when compared to the isotropic scenario. Different electrode montages resulted in distinct distribution patterns with noticeable variations in field strengths. The effect of anisotropy is highly montage dependent and directional conductivity has a more profound effect in defining the strength of the induced field. The inclusion of anisotropy in the GM and subcortical regions has a significant effect on the strength and spatial distribution of the induced electric field. Under the (C3-Fp2) montage, the inclusion of GM and subcortical anisotropy increased the average percentage difference in the electric field strength of brain from 5% to 34% (WM anisotropy only). In terms of patterns distribution, the topographic errors increased from 9.9% to 40% (WM anisotropy only) across the brain.

The targeting of TMS pulses, delivered 55-145\u2009ms after Probes, is confirmed with individual-level cortical electric-field estimates.

While much of PD research has focused on the caudate/putamen, many aspects of motor cortex function are abnormal in PD patients and in animal models of PD, implicating motor cortex involvement in disease symptoms and their treatment. Herein, we discuss several lines of evidence to support this hypothesis. Dopamine depletion alters regional metabolism in the motor cortex and also reduces interneuron activity, causing a breakdown in intracortical inhibition. This leads to functional reorganization of motor maps and excessive corticostriatal synchrony when movement is initiated. Recent work suggests that electrical stimulation of the motor cortex provides a clinical benefit for PD patients. Based on extant research, we identify a number of unanswered questions regarding the motor cortex in PD and argue that a better understanding of the contribution of the motor cortex to PD symptoms will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Transcranial stimulation and cognition.", "keywords": ["TES", "TMS", "ataxia", "ataxic hemiparesis", "cerebellar TMS", "cerebellar facilitation", "cerebellar inhibition", "cerebellar stimulation", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24112935", "authors": ["Miniussi, C", "Ruzzoli, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a unique method for studying cognitive function. For the study of cognition, NIBS has gained popularity as a complementary method to functional neuroimaging. By bypassing the correlative approaches of standard imaging techniques, it is possible to establish a putative relationship between brain cognition. In fact, functional neuroimaging data cannot demonstrate the actual role of a particular cortical activation in a specific function because an activated area may simply be correlated with task performance, rather than being responsible for it. NIBS can induce a temporary modification of performance only if the stimulated area is causally engaged in the task. In analogy with lesion studies, NIBS can provide information about where and when a particular process occurs. Based on this assumption, NIBS has been used in many different cognitive domains. However, one of the most interesting questions in neuroscience may not be where and when, but how cognitive activity occurs. Beyond localization approaches, NIBS can be employed to study brain mechanisms. NIBS techniques have the potential to influence behavior transiently by altering neuronal activity, which may have facilitatory or inhibitory behavioral effects. NIBS techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). TMS has been shown transiently to modulate neural excitability in a manner that is dependent mainly on the timing and frequency of stimulation (high versus low). The mechanism underlying tES is a change in neuronal membrane potentials that appears to be dependent mainly on the direction of current flow (anodal versus cathodal). Nevertheless, the final effects induced by TMS or tES depend on many technical parameters used during stimulation, such as the intensity of stimulation, coil orientation, site of the reference electrode, and time of application. Moreover, an important factor is the possible interactions between these factors and the physiological and cognitive state of the subject. To use NIBS in cognition, it is important to understand not only how NIBS functions but also the brain mechanisms being studied and the features of the area of interest. To describe better the advanced knowledge provided by NIBS in cognition, we will treat each NIBS technique separately and underline the related hypotheses beyond applications.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Cerebellum.", "keywords": ["TMS", "aura", "cortical excitability", "homeostatic plasticity", "migraine", "noninvasive brain stimulation", "rTMS", "tDCS"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24112930", "authors": ["Groiss, SJ", "Ugawa, Y"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "The cerebellum plays an essential role in movement execution and motor control by modulating the primary motor cortex (M1) through cerebellothalamocortical connections.

Despite intensive research effort in recent years, the etiopathogenesis of the disease remains to be elucidated.

In recent years, noninvasive brain stimulation techniques based on magnetic fields (transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS) and on direct electrical currents (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) have been shown to be safe and effective tools to explore the issue of cortical excitability, activation, and plasticity in migraine. Moreover, TMS, repetitive TMS (rTMS), and tDCS, thanks to their ability to interfere with and/or modulate cortical activity inducing plastic, persistent effects, have been also explored as potential therapeutic approaches, opening an interesting perspective for noninvasive neurostimulation for both symptomatic and preventive treatment of migraine and other types of headache.

Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective treatment approaches. Functional imaging studies in patients with tinnitus have revealed alterations in neuronal activity of central auditory pathways, probably resulting as a consequence of sensory deafferentation. However, nonauditory brain areas are also involved. These nonauditory brain areas might represent both an \"awareness\" network involved in the conscious perception of the tinnitus signal as well as areas related to a nontinnitus-specific distress network consisting of the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala. Moreover, memory mechanisms involving the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region may play a role in the persistence of the awareness of the phantom percept, as well as in the reinforcement of the associated distress. All of these networks represent potential targets for treatment via pharmacological treatment or noninvasive and invasive brain stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method of applying electromagnetic fields to the brain that can induce alterations of neuronal activity that outlast the stimulation period. Single sessions of rTMS over the temporal or temporoparietal cortex have been successful in transiently reducing tinnitus perception. Repeated sessions of rTMS have resulted in tinnitus relief in a subgroup of patients, lasting from several days to several months. However, effect sizes of rTMS in the treatment of tinnitus are only moderate, and interindividual variability is high. Larger and longer lasting effects have been observed with direct electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex via implanted epidural electrodes. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has also shown potential for the treatment of tinnitus. Both auditory and frontal tDCS have shown tinnitus reduction in a subgroup of patients. In spite of the promising results of the different brain stimulation approaches, further research is needed before these techniques can be recommended for routine clinical use.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Physics of effects of transcranial brain stimulation.", "keywords": ["transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)", "transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)", "transcranial electrical stimulation (TES)", "transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)", "transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24112908", "authors": ["Miranda, PC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "The effects of transcranial stimulation are determined to a large extent by the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the electric field produced in the brain.
