This technique has recently been rediscovered and its effects validated with modern quantitative techniques and experimental designs. Despite the very weak current used, DC polarization applied to specific brain areas can alter verbal fluency, motor learning and perceptual thresholds, and can be used in conjunction with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Compact and safe, this old technique seems poised to allow major advances cognitive science and therapy.", "pages": "503-5"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Cold saline injection attenuates motor-evoked potential in the spinal cord by cortical electrical stimulation in the dog.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16180700", "authors": ["Kumagai, H", "Sugawara, Y", "Isaka, M", "Okada, K", "Orihashi, K", "Sueda, T"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Hiroshima journal of medical sciences", "abstract": "Changes in the motor-evoked potential of the spinal cord with transcranial stimulation are monitored for spinal cord function during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgeries. We examined the effects of changes in motor-evoked potential with cold saline injected into the clamped segment of the aorta, and compared the effects to lidocaine and warm saline injection. Eighteen dogs were divided into three groups according to the injected agents: Warm saline group (37 degrees C, 20 ml), Cold saline group (4 degrees C, 20 ml), and Lidocaine group (5.0 mg/kg of lidocaine in 20 ml of warm saline), (n=6, each group). Changes in the peak-to-peak MEP amplitude and the indirect wave (I wave) amplitude were measured during aortic cross-clamping. In the peak-to-peak MEP amplitude, the cold saline and lidocaine groups attenuated to 80% of the control value but were not significantly changed. In the I wave amplitude, the cold saline group showed a significant attenuation 1 min after injection (p<0.0001) and the lidocaine group 4 min after injection (p=0.0230), when compared with the warm saline group. Attenuation of the I wave amplitude in the cold saline group was significantly larger than that in the lidocaine group (p=0.0003). Changes in the I wave amplitude appeared within 4 min in both the cold saline and lidocaine groups. Cold saline injection into the clamped segment of the aorta is a diagnostic procedure for determining presiding critical arteries in the segment without experiencing the pharmacological side effects observed with lidocaine injection.", "pages": "503-5"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation impairs verbal working memory.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16178033", "authors": ["Desmond, JE", "Chen, SH", "Shieh, PB"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging and patient studies indicate cerebellar participation in verbal working memory. In particular, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging showed superior cerebellar activation during the initial encoding phase of the Sternberg task. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test whether disruption of the right superior cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI/Crus I) impairs verbal working memory performance. Single-pulse TMS was administered immediately after letter presentation during the encoding phase on half the trials. Sham TMS and a Motor Control task were included to test for general distraction and nonmemory-related motor effects. Results showed no effects of TMS on accuracy, but reaction times (RTs) on correct trials were significantly increased on TMS relative to non-TMS trials for the Verbal Working Memory and Motor Control tasks. Additional analyses showed that the increased RT was significantly greater for Verbal Working Memory than for the motor task, suggesting that the effect on working memory was not caused by interference with finger responses. Sham TMS did not affect RTs, indicating that the potentially distracting effects of the postencoding click did not contribute to the increase in RT. The observed effects from cerebellar disruption are consistent with proposed cerebrocerebellar involvement in verbal working memory.", "pages": "503-5"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Improvement of choreic movements by 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Huntington's disease patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16178020", "authors": ["Brusa, L", "Versace, V", "Koch, G", "Bernardi, G", "Iani, C", "Stanzione, P", "Centonze, D"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Previous studies have used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to show that short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined whether reduced SICI in PD is caused by an increase in the threshold of inhibitory pathways or a reduction in the threshold of excitatory pathways. Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from a hand muscle in 12 patients with PD (7 patients were tested off and on antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 control subjects. SICI was tested at seven conditioning stimulus intensities (CSIs; 40-100% of resting motor threshold) and at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2, 3, and 4 milliseconds. No differences were found between groups in resting or active motor threshold, SICI threshold, or the extent of SICI at CSIs at or below 80% of resting motor threshold. Significant differences between groups were observed at CSIs of 90% and 100% with an ISI of 3 milliseconds. Antiparkinsonian medication had no effect on SICI. These findings show that the low threshold inhibitory pathways mediating SICI are normal in PD. The suppression of SICI observed at higher CSIs suggests that the threshold of intracortical facilitatory pathways is decreased in PD.", "pages": "503-5"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Pathways mediating abnormal intracortical inhibition in Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16178015", "authors": ["MacKinnon, CD", "Gilley, EA", "Weis-McNulty, A", "Simuni, T"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Static changes of the shoulder joint from 30 degrees adduction (ANT) to 30 degrees abduction (POST) in the horizontal plane reduce the gain of the input--output relationship of the corticospinal pathway to the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle [F.

The present study examined force estimation under conditions in which the input--output relationship of the corticospinal innervation to ADM was modified by changing shoulder position as above. The input--output relationship was studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Estimates of force were assessed using a matching procedure; subjects first matched a target level (10--40% of maximum) on a screen by applying a reference (Ref) isometric contraction of ADM and then they reproduced the same level of force without visual feedback by a test contraction (Test). When Ref and Test contractions were performed at either ANT or POST (i.e. the same input--output), the respective force levels were closely matched. In contrast, when the Test and Ref were performed in POST and ANT, respectively (i.e. different input--output), subjects exerted more force than required. Errors were in the opposite direction when the Test and Ref were in ANT and POST, respectively. The present results suggest that the process of force estimation is based on the effort : tension ratio which is a direct function of the corticomotoneuronal input--output relationship. This notion may contribute to explaining the pathophysiology of central fatigue.", "pages": "503-5"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Force estimation processing as a function of the input--output relationship of the corticospinal pathway in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "16176354", "authors": ["Gelli, F", "Del Santo, F", "Mazzocchio, R", "Rossi, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "General condition and local status were analysed in patients with chronic idiopathic eczema before the conventional treatment and combined therapy including sessions of transcranial electrostimulation and dalargin phonophoresis and after these treatments.

In 3 other patients, the amplitude ratio obtained in response to conventional TMS was abnormally low, but the area ratio was normal. The TST amplitude ratio and area ratio were normal in these 3 patients. This pattern suggested the occurrence of temporal dispersion without CB. The occurrence of temporal dispersion or CB was associated with a relatively satisfactory response to intravenous immunoglobulins.
