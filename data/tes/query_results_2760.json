We examined whether a similar effect exists for reflexive saccades and vergence. To elicit reflexive movements, a gap paradigm was used; lateral saccades and vergence along the median plane were interleaved. TMS was applied on the right PPC 80 ms after target onset. Blocks without TMS were performed and a control experiment with TMS over the primary motor cortex. The latter had no effect on the latency of any type of movements. In contrast, stimulation of the PPC increased the latency of both saccades and vergence, suggesting that the PPC is involved in the triggering of reflexive movements both in direction and in depth.", "pages": "1035-40"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "External modulation of visual perception in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "16", "pmid": "11733710", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a new method for investigating cortical information processing and for investigating therapeutic applications in psychiatry and neurology. A common problem of most studies in this field regards the localization of the magnetic coil with respect to the cortex. This article reviews the currently used methods and proposes a neuronavigational approach. The method of neuronavigated TMS is described and discussed in detail. It is used to guide the magnetic coil on an individual basis to a structurally or functionally predetermined cortical area while monitoring the location of the coil in relation to the subject's head in real time. Possible applications of TMS in combination with functional neuroimaging in clinical research within a cognitive neuroscience framework are discussed. Future applications of TMS should take individual anatomy into account, and neuronavigation provides the means to do so.", "pages": "1035-40"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Modification of cortical excitability induced by gabapentin: a study by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "11731875", "authors": ["Rizzo, V", "Quartarone, A", "Bagnato, S", "Battaglia, F", "Majorana, G", "Girlanda, P"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Reliable recording of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the masseter muscle by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has proved more difficult than from facial or intrinsic hand muscles.
