The amplitude of MEPs to TMS recorded from the resting muscle after each exercise period was on average more than twice the pre-exercise value (postexercise MEP facilitation). After fatigue occurred, the MEP amplitudes were approximately 60% of the pre-exercise value (postexercise MEP depression). There was a gradual recovery of the depressed MEPs to pre-exercise values over several minutes of rest. Postexercise MEP facilitation was constant when exercise intensity ranged from 10 to 50% of maximum voluntary contraction and it decayed to baseline over several minutes after the end of exercise.

Since most anesthetics significantly reduce motoneuronal excitability, optimal stimulation paradigms should be sought. We compared the efficiency of stimulus delivery using two different configurations of the cathode component of the stimulating electrode pair (circumferential: Fz, F3, F4, A1, and A2 versus a single cathode at Fz). The anode was positioned at Cz with both cathode configurations. Fourteen neurologically normal patients undergoing spinal surgery were anesthetized with sufentanil-N2O-ketamine. Partial neuromuscular blockade (single twitch height 25%) was maintained with vecuronium. Compound action potentials to transcranial stimulation with both cathode configurations were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle. All recordings were completed before spinal manipulation. The median amplitude response using the Fz cathode configuration was 256 microV (10th-90th percentiles: 50-641 microV). With the circumferential cathode configuration, tc-MER amplitude increased to 281 (87-1479) microV (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in onset latency between electrode configurations. The observed tc-MER amplitude augmentation with the use of a circumferential cathode might allow tc-MER monitoring in those patients who do not have sufficiently reproducible responses when a single cathode is used. A possible explanation is that the circumferential cathode alters the direction of the electrical currents in the cortex, resulting in more efficient depolarization of cortical motor neurons.", "pages": "45-8"}, {"volume": "82", "title": "The use of a circumferential cathode improves amplitude of intraoperative electrical transcranial myogenic motor evoked responses.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "8610858", "authors": ["Ubags, LH", "Kalkman, CJ", "Been, HD", "Drummond, JC"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Voluntary muscle activation was measured with twitch interpolation in 11 subjects during attempted maximal voluntary contractions of the right thumb adductor muscles either in isolation (\"thumb alone\") or as the subjects simultaneously performed maximal voluntary contractions of the left thumb adductors or left elbow flexors (\"both thumbs\" or \"thumb and elbow\", respectively). During thumb alone contractions, median voluntary activation of the right thumb adductors was 90.3%, and subjects fully activated the thumb adductors on 22% of all contractions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the cortex during maximal voluntary efforts produced small twitchlike force increases, suggesting that at least part of the voluntary activation failure was attributable to suboptimal corticospinal drive. Maximal voluntary force produced by the right thumb adductors in the three conditions differed by < 2% (P = 0.21), and the ability to activate the thumb adductors in the both thumbs condition was only marginally less than during thumb alone contractions (median 88.6%; P = 0.004).

Paired stimuli were delivered to the motor cortex with a circular coil at 1.1 times motor evoked potential (MEP) threshold, with various interstimulus intervals. Voluntary activation caused a marked decrease in the variability of the ratio of the amplitude of the MEP evoked by the test pulse to that of the MEP evoked by the conditioning pulse. Marked inhibition of the MEP evoked by the test pulse was still present. Postactivation, however, caused a dramatic reversal of the inhibitory effect of the conditioning pulse in all subjects at interstimulus intervals ranging from 40 to 120 ms. This effect lasted for up to 10 s following the cessation of activation. MEPs to transcranial electrical stimulation were also inhibited by conditioning TMS, but postactivation did not reverse this inhibition, indicating that the reversal of paired pulse inhibition is intracortical.

The threshold intensity for evoking an electromyographic response in the resting and active abductor digiti minimi muscle, the size of the motor evoked potential, the duration of the cortical and peripheral silent periods, the corticocortical inhibition and facilitation after paired magnetic stimuli, and the transcallosal inhibition were used as parameters to assess various aspects of motor system excitability. Baseline values were compared with data obtained 2, 5 and 24 h after a single oral dose of 2.5 mg lorazepam. Resting and active motor thresholds and the size of the motor evoked potential remained unchanged. The duration of the cortical silent period was prolonged with a maximum effect 5 h after drug intake, while the peripheral silent period did not show any lengthening at that time. The corticocortical inhibition showed a tendency toward more inhibition, while the corticocortical facilitation was almost completely suppressed. The transcallosal inhibition showed an inconsistent trend to less inhibition. In parallel to the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam, all effects peaked at 2 h and 5 h, and were (partially) reversible after 24 h. It is hypothesized that most of these findings are due to the reinforcement of GABA action by lorazepam at the level of the motor cortex. The lack of effect on motor threshold and on the size of the motor evoked potential may indicate that these parameters are physiologically distinct from corticocortical excitability and the cortical silent period.

In this study, a group of 15 children 3-7 years of age suffering from attention deficit were investigated using both methods in combination and were compared to a control group of 23 age-matched normal children. On the computerized EEG spectral analysis significant differences to the control group were found in areas O1 and O2 (P < 0.05, Student's t-test).

Monopolar needle electrodes with isolated shafts were used for simultaneous bilateral electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the SCM. TMS given on either side invariably induced an ipsilateral motor evoked potential of the SCM (SCM-MEP), whereas a contralateral SCM-MEP was just seen in 25% of the performed stimulation series also when maximal intensity was used.

These results support the concept of a predominantly ipsilateral control of SCM activation. The contralateral SCM-MEPs tended to have a shorter latency than the ipsilateral SCM-MEPs. The thresholds of the ipsilateral SCM-MEPs were significantly higher (P < 0.01) on the left side than on the right side (mean +/- S.D.: 78 +/- 18 and 60 +/- 16 A/microseconds, respectively), which could be due to the consistent use of counter-clockwise coil current direction.
