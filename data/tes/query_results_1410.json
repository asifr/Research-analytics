When we operate EAS treatment, we can modulate the intensity and frequency of stimulation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of different frequencies in treating motor dysfunction of ischemic stroke patients with EAS. The subjects of this study were 62 ischemic stroke patients with motor dysfunction in Kyunghee oriental medical center. They have been hospitalized after 1 week to 1 month from onset. They were treated with 2 Hz or 120 Hz EAS for 2 weeks, and had motor evoked potentials (MEPs) tests before and after 2 weeks of EAS treatment. We measured latency, central motor conduction time (CMCT) and amplitude of MEPs. After 2 weeks of treatment, we compared MEPs data of the affected side between the 2 Hz group and the 120 Hz group. The 2 Hz group showed more significant improvement than the 120 Hz group in latency, CMCT and amplitude (p = 0.008, 0.002, 0.002). In the case of the affected side MEPs data divided by normal side MEPs data, the 2 Hz group also showed higher improvement rate than the 120 Hz group in latency, CMCT and amplitude with significant differences (p = 0.003, 0.000, 0.008). These results suggest that low frequency EAS activates the central motor conduction system better than high frequency EAS, and EAS with low frequency could be more helpful for motor recovery after ischemic stroke than that with high frequency.", "pages": "45-54"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Transient suppression of seizures by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a case of Rasmussen's encephalitis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18304879", "authors": ["Rotenberg, A", "Depositario-Cabacar, D", "Bae, EH", "Harini, C", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Takeoka, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been applied with variable success to terminate the seizures of epilepsia partialis continua. The rationale for using this technique to suppress ongoing seizures is the capacity of rTMS to interrupt ongoing neuronal activity, and to produce a lasting decrease in cortical excitability with low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation. We report a case of epilepsia partialis continua in a child with Rasmussen's encephalitis, in whom seizures were transiently suppressed by 1-Hz rTMS delivered in nine daily 30-minute sessions. In this case, total ictal time was significantly reduced during stimulation, but the daily baseline seizure rate remained unchanged. Notably, the detection and quantification of this short-lived improvement were enabled by recording EEG continuously during the rTMS session. Thus, we present this case to illustrate a potential utility of combined continuous EEG recording and rTMS in seizure treatment.", "pages": "45-54"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation improves language learning.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "17068786", "authors": ["Fl\u00f6el, A", "R\u00f6sser, N", "Michka, O", "Knecht, S", "Breitenstein, C"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a reliable technique to improve motor learning. We here wanted to test its potential to enhance associative verbal learning, a skill crucial for both acquiring new languages in healthy individuals and for language reacquisition after stroke-induced aphasia. We applied tDCS (20 min, 1 mA) over the posterior part of the left peri-sylvian area of 19 young right-handed individuals while subjects acquired a miniature lexicon of 30 novel object names. Every subject participated in one session of anodal tDCS, one session of cathodal tDCS, and one sham session in a randomized and double-blinded design with three parallel versions of the miniature lexicon. Outcome measures were learning speed and learning success at the end of each session, and the transfer to the subjects' native language after the respective stimulation. With anodal stimulation, subjects showed faster and better associative learning as compared to sham stimulation. Mood ratings, reaction times, and response styles were comparable between stimulation conditions.

However, the precise time-course of their contribution remains unknown, which is of particular interest, considering that it could give new insights into the mechanisms underlying auditory space perception. To address this issue, we have used event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce virtual lesions of either the right PPC or right OC at different delays in subjects performing a sound lateralization task. Our results confirmed that these two areas participate in the spatial processing of sounds. More precisely, we found that TMS applied over the right OC 50 msec after the stimulus onset significantly impaired the localization of sounds presented either to the right or to the left side. Moreover, right PPC virtual lesions induced 100 and 150 msec after sound presentation led to a rightward bias for stimuli delivered on the center and on the left side, reproducing transiently the deficits commonly observed in hemineglect patients. The finding that the right OC is involved in sound processing before the right PPC suggests that the OC exerts a feedforward influence on the PPC during auditory spatial processing.", "pages": "45-54"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Homeostatic metaplasticity in the human somatosensory cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "15564059", "authors": ["Bliem, B", "M\u00fcller-Dahlhaus, JF", "Dinse, HR", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are regulated by homeostatic control mechanisms to maintain synaptic strength in a physiological range. Although homeostatic metaplasticity has been demonstrated in the human motor cortex, little is known to which extent it operates in other cortical areas and how it links to behavior. Here we tested homeostatic interactions between two stimulation protocols -- paired associative stimulation (PAS) followed by peripheral high-frequency stimulation (pHFS) -- on excitability in the human somatosensory cortex and tactile spatial discrimination threshold. PAS employed repeated pairs of electrical stimulation of the right median nerve followed by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left somatosensory cortex at an interstimulus interval of the individual N20 latency minus 15 msec or N20 minus 2.5 msec to induce LTD- or LTP-like plasticity, respectively [Wolters, A., Schmidt, A., Schramm, A., Zeller, D., Naumann, M., Kunesch, E., et al. Timing-dependent plasticity in human primary somatosensory cortex. Journal of Physiology, 565, 1039-1052, 2005]. pHFS always consisted of 20-Hz trains of electrical stimulation of the right median nerve. Excitability in the somatosensory cortex was assessed by median nerve somatosensory evoked cortical potential amplitudes. Tactile spatial discrimination was tested by the grating orientation task. PAS had no significant effect on excitability in the somatosensory cortex or on tactile discrimination. However, the direction of effects induced by subsequent pHFS varied with the preconditioning PAS protocol: After PAS(N20-15), excitability tended to increase and tactile spatial discrimination threshold decreased. After PAS(N20-2.5), excitability decreased and discrimination threshold tended to increase. These interactions demonstrate that homeostatic metaplasticity operates in the human somatosensory cortex, controlling both cortical excitability and somatosensory skill.", "pages": "45-54"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "A reconstruction of the conductive phenomena elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation in heterogeneous brain tissue.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15016013", "authors": ["Toschi, N", "Welt, T", "Guerrisi, M", "Keck, ME"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation is an attractive research and possibly therapeutic tool for non-invasive stimulation of brain tissue. However, relatively little is known about the direction, magnitude and distribution of induced fields and current flow in tissue, and optimal setup characteristics remain largely undetermined. Further, the profound influence of brain size and shape as well as of brain tissue irregularity on actual stimulation patterns is unclear. We model the conductive phenomena induced in brain tissue by TMS by solving the quasistatic problem over a realistic head model of 1mm resolution derived from anatomical MRI scans using a finite difference successive overrelaxation procedure. The magnetic field is calculated from digitized coil geometry and realistic stimulator parameters. Stimulation with a symmetrical primary electric field results in electric field and current density distributions which are highly asymmetrical both in magnitude and in direction (i.e. distributed, non-contiguous stimulation peaks, deviation of stimulated area from coil \"hot spot\", sudden jumps in stimulation intensity and non-zero current flow across tissue interfaces). Knowledge of coil and stimulator specifications alone is hence not sufficient to control stimulation conditions, and a stereotaxic setup coupled with an individually adjusted field solver appears essential in performing reliable TMS studies. Our results bear direct relevance to any application of TMS, both investigative and therapeutic.", "pages": "45-54"}, {"volume": "79", "title": "Changes in intracortical excitability after successful epilepsy surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "1978057", "authors": ["L\u00e4ppchen, CH", "Feil, B", "Fauser, S", "Wuwer, Y", "Glocker, FX", "Schulze-Bonhage, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "Interictal activity from epileptic foci may have remote effects as demonstrable by assessing brain perfusion, metabolism and excitability. So far, the effect of surgical removal of the epileptic focus on cortical networks has only rarely been addressed. This study aims at an assessment of changes in intracortical inhibition and excitability in patients undergoing successful epilepsy surgery. Twenty-two patients (12 females, 10 males, mean age 37.8 years) with identical pre- and postsurgical antiepileptic medication were investigated using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation. Motor thresholds (MT), contralateral cortical silent periods (CSP) and amplitudes of motor evoked potentials (MEP) using paired pulse paradigms were investigated both, at the focal and non-focal hemisphere before and at least 3 months after successful epilepsy surgery. The postsurgical mean MT when stimulating at the focal hemisphere was significantly higher than at the non-focal hemisphere (p=0.01). Postsurgically, the mean duration of the CSP at 120% and at 150% of MT of the non-focal hemisphere was significantly shorter than presurgically (p=0.04), and the mean MEP amplitude following paired-pulse stimulation with an interstimulus interval of 10 ms of the non-focal hemisphere was significantly lower than presurgically (p=0.03). In summary, both parameters representing inhibition and facilitation changed following epilepsy surgery; effects were statistically significant on the non-focal hemisphere. Transcranial magnetic stimulation thus gave evidence of remote effects of an epileptic focus and its surgical removal. Extended changes in excitability due to the presence or absence of an epileptic focus may be related to widespread functional impairments in patients with focal epilepsy.", "pages": "45-54"}, {"volume": "106", "title": "The effects of the neuromuscular blockade levels on amplitudes of posttetanic motor-evoked potentials and movement in response to transcranial stimulation in patients receiving propofol and fentanyl anesthesia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17493877", "authors": ["Yamamoto, Y", "Kawaguchi, M", "Hayashi, H", "Horiuchi, T", "Inoue, S", "Nakase, H", "Sakaki, T", "Furuya, H"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Patient movement in response to transcranial stimulation during monitoring of myogenic motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) may interfere with surgery.
