The subjects were 27 inpatients with multi-infarct dementia (12 males and 15 females, aged 58-86). They were randomly divided into two groups: active treatment (n = 14) and placebo treatment (n = 13). For electrostimulation, a device (HESS-100) was used which delivered repetitive rectangular electric pulses of 6-8 V at increasing frequencies from 6 to 80 Hz, each pulse lasting 0.2 ms and with a root mean square value of 256-530 microA. Electrostimulation was performed for 20 minutes from 10:00 h every morning. The active or placebo treatment was performed for 2 weeks in each group. The electrostimulation was significantly effective in behavior disorders such as wandering or nocturnal delirium, and decreased motivation during the daytime. It was also effective in improving night sleep. Electroencephalograms confirmed increased vigilance levels in the daytime both during and after the treatment.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Favorable effect of transcranial electrostimulation on behavior disorders in elderly patients with dementia: a double-blind study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "9003961", "authors": ["Hozumi, S", "Hori, H", "Okawa, M", "Hishikawa, Y", "Sato, K"], "year": "1996", "journal": "The International journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The term 'brain plasticity' means the brain capacity to diminish the effects of the lesions through structural functional changes. A great part of the pathological processes of the nervous system affecting the corticospinal and the subcorticospinal tracts, the cerebellar, spinal, visual, language and other systems show neuronal plasticity, spontaneously in some cases and after suitable rehabilitation in others. The clinical manifestations of neuronal plasticity are observed especially after prenatal, neonatal or childhood cerebral damage. During the adulthood, the brain has less capacity of neuronal plasticity, although plastic changes may be found at any age. Apart the clinic, the neuronal plasticity can be studied through electrophysiology, MR, positron emission tomography (PET), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TME), and obviously by histology, this latter especially in experimental studies. In pediatric Neurology, the concept of brain plasticity is frequently used to explain the favourable clinic evolution in a lot of cases with severe brain injury.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "[Neuronal plasticity].", "keywords": [], "issue": "135", "pmid": "8974738", "authors": ["Pascual-Castroviejo, I"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Revista de neurologia", "abstract": "The electromyographic response of the diaphragm to (a) transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TCES) of the spinal cord at C5 and above, (b) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex and (c) transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve in the neck (TPNS), was recorded in six normal subjects at the antero-lateral chest wall. The compound motor evoked potentials (cMEPs) recorded in response to both TMS and TCES were facilitated to a similar extent during volitional inspiration; this facilitation was greater than any change seen in response to TPNS with inspiration. The results show that facilitation of the response in the diaphragm to TMS during volitional inspiration is due to increased excitability at synapses associated with the spinal motoneurone pool, but they do not exclude a component due to increased higher centre excitability. We conclude that it is unsafe to assign a cortical contribution to 'automatic' inspiration on the sole basis of facilitation of the electromyographic response in the diaphragm to TMS.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "106", "title": "Site of facilitation of diaphragm EMG to corticospinal stimulation during inspiration.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "8971986", "authors": ["Davey, NJ", "Murphy, K", "Maskill, DW", "Guz, A", "Ellaway, PH"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Respiration physiology", "abstract": "1. In seven normal subjects, subthreshold transcranial magnetic conditioning stimuli (using a figure-of-eight coil) were applied over the motor cortex in order to evoke activity in intracortical neuronal circuits. The net effect on cortical excitability was evaluated by measuring the effect on the size of EMG responses elicited in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle by a subsequent suprathreshold test stimulus. 2. A single conditioning stimulus suppressed the size of the test response at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-4 ms whereas the response was facilitated at ISIs of 6-20 ms. The facilitation could be augmented if pairs of conditioning stimuli were given. 3. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to have separate mechanisms. The threshold for inhibition (0.7 active motor threshold) was slightly lower than that for facilitation (0.8 active threshold). Similarly, the inhibitory effect was independent of the direction of current flow induced in the cortex by the conditioning shock, whereas facilitation was maximal with posterior-anterior currents and minimal with lateromedial current. 4. Direct corticospinal effects were probably not responsible for the results since facilitation of cortical test responses could be produced by conditioning stimuli which had no effect on the amplitude of H reflexes elicited in active ADM muscle. 5. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to interact in a roughly linear manner, consistent with separate inputs to a common neurone. 6. We suggest that subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation is capable of activating separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurones in the motor cortex.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "496 ( Pt 3)", "title": "Interaction between intracortical inhibition and facilitation in human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "8930851", "authors": ["Ziemann, U", "Rothwell, JC", "Ridding, MC"], "year": "1996", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "To record prospectively combined motor- and somatosensory-evoked potentials in children during scoliosis surgery using Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation, without using special anesthetic or muscle relaxant regimens.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Cotrel-dubousset instrumentation in children using simultaneous motor and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring.", "keywords": [], "issue": "21", "pmid": "1282453", "authors": ["Stephen, JP", "Sullivan, MR", "Hicks, RG", "Burke, DJ", "Woodforth, IJ", "Crawford, MR"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "To determine the outcome of scoliosis surgery guided by a new technique of monitoring motor- and somatosensory-evoked potentials simultaneously.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "83", "title": "A comparison of the sensitivity of epidural and myogenic transcranial motor-evoked responses in the detection of acute spinal cord ischemia in the rabbit.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "8740215", "authors": ["de Haan, P", "Kalkman, CJ", "Ubags, LH", "Jacobs, MJ", "Drummond, JC"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Other techniques used to assess cord function generally are limited by special anesthetic requirements or assess only a limited part of the cord or monitor motor function separately from somatosensory function.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Central fatigue assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "1371739", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Kotterba, S", "Tegenthoff, M", "Malin, JP"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Spinal cord function was monitored using epidural leads to record simultaneously the descending motor volley (by transcranial electrical stimulation) and the ascending somatosensory volley (by tibial nerve stimulation) at two spinal levels.", "pages": "278-80"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Comparison of peripheral Ia and corticomotoneuronal composite EPSPs in human motoneurons.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1431984", "authors": ["Jones, KE", "Calancie, B", "Hall, A", "Bawa, P"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Combined motor- and sensory-evoked potentials were recorded successfully in 138 of 160 children (81%).
