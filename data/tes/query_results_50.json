One potential way to enhance our capacities may be to externally stimulate the brain. Methods of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), have been recently developed to modulate brain activity. Both techniques are relatively safe and can transiently modify motor and cognitive functions outlasting the stimulation period. The purpose of this paper is to review data suggesting that NIBS can enhance motor and cognitive performance in healthy volunteers. We frame these findings in the context of whether they may serve security purposes. Specifically, we review studies reporting that NIBS induces paradoxical facilitation in motor (precision, speed, strength, acceleration endurance, and execution of daily motor task) and cognitive functions (attention, impulsive behavior, risk-taking, working memory, planning, and deceptive capacities). Although transferability and meaningfulness of these NIBS-induced paradoxical facilitations into real-life situations are not clear yet, NIBS may contribute at improving training of motor and cognitive functions relevant for military, civil, and forensic security services. This is an enthusiastic perspective that also calls for fair and open debates on the ethics of using NIBS in healthy individuals to enhance normal functions.", "pages": "3166-74"}, {"volume": "219", "title": "Classification of methods in transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and evolving strategy from historical approaches to contemporary innovations.", "keywords": ["EPM1", "Unverricht-Lundborg disease", "progressive myoclonus epilepsy", "transcranial magnetic stimulation motor cortex"], "issue": "2", "pmid": "23954780", "authors": ["Guleyupoglu, B", "Schestatsky, P", "Edwards, D", "Fregni, F", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "Paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocols induce forms of spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) when paired pulses are repeatedly applied with different timing over interconnected cortical areas such as the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the primary motor cortex (M1). However, the assessment of PAS effects is usually limited to M1 through recording of motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. Here, by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with EEG we aimed at investigating PAS effects over both areas (PPC, M1) and the modulation induced on their connectivity in humans. In different PAS conditions, PPC preceded or followed M1 TMS by 5 ms. We found that TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) changed differently according to the long-term depression (LTD) or potentiation (LTP) after-effect assessed by MEPs, but did not vary at PPC level. Moreover, there was no change in local oscillatory power. However, there was a remarkable increase of coherence between the PPC and the M1 areas. When the PAS protocol induced LTD as revealed by MEPs, there was a specific increase of the coherence between PPC and M1 within the beta band. On the contrary, when PAS induced LTP, the coherence crucially increased in the alpha band. The same LTP results were confirmed when rotating the stimulating coil in M1 during the PAS protocol. In conclusion, we report new evidence that opposite STDP-like effects induced by corticocortical PAS are associated with increased communication between involved brain areas and that antithetic forms of STDP-like after-effects result in distinct cortical rhythms connectivity changes.", "pages": "3166-74"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Cortical inhibition is reduced following short-term training in young and older adults.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23943112", "authors": ["Christie, A", "Kamen, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)", "abstract": "Purpose: We examined the feasibility and outcome of electromyographically triggered electrical muscle stimulation (EMG-ES) plus unilateral or bilateral task specific practice on arm function in chronic stroke survivors with moderate-severe hemiplegia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine inter-hemispheric inhibition (IHI) acting on the stroke-affected hemisphere in a subset of eight participants. Methods: Twenty-one stroke survivors (14 males; mean time post stroke 57.9 months) participated in this pilot investigation. Participants underwent a six-week program of daily EMG-ES training with random assignment to concurrent task practice using the stroke-affected hand only or both hands. The upper-extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer (FMUE) and the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT) were completed at baseline, 0-, 1-, and 3-months post-intervention. Results: Following the intervention, FMUE (F(3, 57) = 3.89, p = .01, \u03b7p2 = .17) and AMAT (F(3, 57) = 12.6, p = .01, \u03b7p2 = .39) scores improved, and remained better than baseline at three months re-assessment. The difference between groups was not significant. A non-significant decrease in IHI was observed post-intervention. Conclusions: An intensive program of EMG-ES assisted functional training is feasible, well tolerated, and leads to improvements in moderate-severe deficits of arm function post stroke. Larger placebo controlled studies are needed to explore any advantage of bilateral over unilateral EMG-ES assisted training.", "pages": "3166-74"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with transcranial electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23935578", "authors": ["Saiote, C", "Turi, Z", "Paulus, W", "Antal, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Swallowing disturbance is among the most burdensome complications suffered by patients with glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve involvement in lesions adjacent the jugular foramen.
