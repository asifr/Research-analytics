In cases of peripheral conduction slowing, upper limits of CMCT must be adapted. Cervical root excitation can be carried out by electrical or magnetic stimulation. The F wave technique also produces reliable results. Electrical stimulation of lumbar roots produces the most reliable results when measuring CMCT to leg muscles. CMCT to the tibialis anterior correlates with height, but not with age or sex. The same is true for intraspinal motor conduction time. Contraction of the target muscle enlarges CMAP amplitudes after cervical and transcranial stimulation. However, a latency shortening is only seen after brain stimulation. This is thought to be at least partially due to spatial summation of D and I waves.

In all cases potentials were evoked by electrical, in addition in 55 of them by electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. The peripheral conduction time was determined in all patients by electrical stimulation of the cervical and lumbar nerve roots, respectively. This study was designed to compare both stimulation techniques (electrical vs. electromagnetic) regarding their significance in recording of potentials as well as in correlation of potentials with the motor status as established by clinical examination. Our results show that potentials were obtained in 87.6% following central (cortex) and in 100% following central electromagnetic stimulation. 87.9% of the recordings in infratentorial and spinal lesions show a correct and 12.2% a \"false positive\" correlation with the clinical motor status. On the other hand, the correlation was false negative in 13.8%, correct in 79.3% and \"false positive\" in 6.9% of the supratentorial cases. There was no difference between electrical and electromagnetic stimulation regarding diagnostic significance of potentials. Our results allow the following conclusions: both electrically and electromagnetically evoked potentials are sensitive for electrophysiological assessment of infratentorial and spinal lesions, but unreliable in evaluation of supratentorial lesions, especially in the acute stage. Due to its painlessness, electromagnetic stimulation is the method of choice for transcranial eliciting of MEP in the awake patient, who is capable of facilitation by voluntary background contraction of the target muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "127-30"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Safety aspects of transcranial brain stimulation in man tested by single photon emission-computed tomography.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "2280887", "authors": ["Dressler, D", "Voth, E", "Feldmann, M", "Benecke, R"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-labelled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO), a new method to visualize regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and epileptogenic foci, was used to study acute and long-term effects of transcranial brain stimulation.
