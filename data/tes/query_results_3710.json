The current did not affect the sleep pattern of normal rats whereas the number of paradoxical sleep episodes increased in insomniac animals. The increased duration of paradoxical sleep in PCPA-treated rats favored the recovery of sleep in this group.

To date there are no reliable data with the investigation of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in this question. In the present study 60 patients with traumatic (group I) and 35 with non-traumatic coma (group II) were examined with both electrophysiological tests. It was the aim of this study to find out whether additional recording of MEP could contribute to a better prediction of the outcome than SEP alone. Our results clearly indicate that in terms of prognostic value SEP are superior to MEP. All patients with bilaterally preserved SEP and a central conduction time less than or equal to 6.5 msec (SEP-type Ia) survived whereas all patients with bilaterally absent cortical responses (SEP-type III) died. On the other hand, 12 patients (30.7%) of group I and 11 patients (39.3%) of group II with bilaterally preserved electromyographic responses following transcranial stimulation (MEP-type I) died. Only the bilateral absence of MEP (type III) was an unerring unfavourable prognostic sign.

The relatively long latencies of these responses and the influence that preactivation of the muscle has on them, suggests that they are cortically evoked. Shorter latency and exclusively ipsilateral responses can be obtained if the position of the stimulating coil over the head is more lateral. These responses are uninfluenced by pre-activation of the muscle which suggests that they arise from stimulation of the peripheral nerve itself. By considering the conduction velocity of the nerve and the response latency such stimulation probably occurs in the proximal intracisternal segment (Fig. 2). The results obtained using magnetic stimulation of the cortex in patients with unilateral cerebral hemisphere lesions lend support to the idea of a bilateral projection from each cerebral hemisphere to the motor nuclei of the facial and hypoglossal nerves on both sides: stimulations over the intact hemisphere produces bilateral responses, whereas stimulations over the damaged hemisphere produce no responses (Fig. 1). In patients with idiopathic facial palsy no short latency responses were obtained on the affected side either during the acute (less than 10 days) or during the chronic phase (greater than 3 months) of the illness-despite clinical improvement during the chronic stage (Fig. 3, 4). However cortically evoked responses were obtainable in patients seen during the chronic phase indicating that facial motoneurones could be excited transsynaptically (Fig. 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "329-36"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "[Characteristics of electrical discharges by transcranial cortex stimulation activated motor units of the hand muscles of the human].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "3145182", "authors": ["Hess, CW", "Mills, KR", "Murray, NM"], "year": "1988", "journal": "EEG-EMG Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektroenzephalographie, Elektromyographie und verwandte Gebiete", "abstract": "Using concentric needle electrode recording from hand muscles (abductor digiti minimi, first dorsal interosseus, or abductor pollicis brevis muscle) the latencies of single motor unit potentials in response to threshold magnetic brain stimuli were studied under different conditions. It has been shown that the motor units activated by threshold brain stimuli had the lowest threshold for voluntary activation (A = vol. activated, B = brain stim.). Onset latencies of 23 motor unit potentials from different sites in the relaxed muscles of four healthy subjects ranged from 22.4 to 32.4 ms (average: 26.4 ms; SD: 2.80 ms) but proved to be relatively stable when stimulating and recording conditions were kept constant (variation less than 0.5 ms, see poststimulus time histogram in Fig. 2). With concurrent contraction of an ipsilateral neighbouring or of the contralateral homologous muscle the motor unit potentials from the relaxed target muscle jumped to an earlier latency by 1.2 to 1.7 ms (C in Fig. 3 and B-2 in Fig. 4). On one occasion another motor unit of higher threshold was alternatively activated by this procedure (B-3 in Fig. 4). Since the same procedures are known to enhance the compound muscle action potentials as recorded from the relaxed muscle with surface electrodes, the shorter latencies of single motor units are considered to be caused by a facilitatory influence on the motoneurones. A possible explanation for these latency shifts would be that the motor units discharge later in response to the brain stimulus induced repetitive cortico-spinal impulses when there is no facilitation, whereas during facilitation the firing level is reached earlier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "329-36"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "[Transcranial cortex stimulation with magnetic field pulses: methodologic and physiologic principles].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "3145181", "authors": ["Hess, CW", "Ludin, HP"], "year": "1988", "journal": "EEG-EMG Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektroenzephalographie, Elektromyographie und verwandte Gebiete", "abstract": "The recently introduced method of painless transcranial brain stimulation using magnetic pulses has proved to be particularly suitable for exciting the motor cortex in conscious humans. The magnetic pulse is generated by a brief current pulse which passes through the stimulating coil, and the time varying magnetic field induces stimulating currents within the brain. Experimental evidence indicates that transcranial magnetic stimulation as opposed to electrical brain stimulation activated corticospinal neurones transsynaptically. With a circular stimulating coil centered near the vertex, upper limb muscles of the right side are preferentially activated with the inducing current clockwise viewed from above and vice versa. For the leg muscles the optimal position of the coil on the scalp is more critical and varies from subject to subject. Voluntary contraction of the target muscle reduces the threshold stimulus intensity, increases the amplitude and shortens the latency of the evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). This facilitatory effect of background muscle activity is most pronounced in the small hand muscles, where only a slight contraction is sufficient to greatly enhance the responses. In a relaxed small hand muscle facilitation of the responses can also be achieved by contraction of either the homologous contralateral or a neighbouring ipsilateral muscle. Even in relaxed state, the CMAPs show an inherent variability which is not related to the subject's motor readiness or mental state in any obvious way, provided the muscles' relaxed state is ascertained. The stimulus strength affects the amplitudes but not the latencies of the responses over a relatively wide range of suprathreshold intensities.", "pages": "329-36"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "[Transcranial magneto-electric stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "3145180", "authors": ["Benecke, R", "Hess, CW"], "year": "1988", "journal": "EEG-EMG Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektroenzephalographie, Elektromyographie und verwandte Gebiete", "abstract": "The central motor conduction time (CMCT) was measured by electrical transcranial and spinal stimulation in 70 consecutively admitted patients with definite multiple sclerosis and 26 normal volunteers.

With the ADM relaxed, vibration produced an early enhancement of compound responses (CMAPs) after transcranial magnetic brain stimuli. This is thought to be due to simultaneous arrival of the descending corticospinal volley and of the afferent la volley at the anterior horn cell. With long lasting vibration an enhancement of responses to brain stimuli continued up to 5 seconds after the onset of vibration. Voluntary muscle contraction increased the CMAP.
