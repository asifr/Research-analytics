We hypothesize that monophasic TMS has a stronger short-term effect during repetitive stimulation than biphasic TMS because monophasic pulses preferentially activate one population of neurons oriented in the same direction so that their effects readily summate. Biphasic pulses in contrast may activate several different populations of neurons (both facilitatory and inhibitory) so that summation of the effects is not so clear as with monophasic pulses. When single stimuli are applied, however, biphasic TMS is thought to be more powerful than monophasic TMS because the peak-to-peak amplitude of stimulus pulse is higher and its duration is longer when the same intensity of stimulation (the same amount of current is stored by the stimulator) is used.", "pages": "605-13"}, {"volume": "76", "title": "Possible transcallosal seizure induction by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in a patient with frontal lobe epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15716551", "authors": ["Reis, J", "Rosenow, F", "Fritsch, B", "Knake, S", "Oertel, WH", "Hamer, HM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "This means that when using rTMS as a therapeutic tool or in research fields, the difference in waveforms of magnetic pulses (monophasic or biphasic) may affect the results.", "pages": "605-13"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Paradoxical effect of digital anaesthesia on force and corticospinal excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15706231", "authors": ["Duque, J", "Vandermeeren, Y", "Lejeune, TM", "Thonnard, JL", "Smith, AM", "Olivier, E"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "To address the limitations of standard electromyography (EMG) facial nerve monitoring techniques by exploring the novel application of multi-pulse transcranial electrical stimulation (mpTES) to myogenic facial motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring.", "pages": "605-13"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Parietal rTMS disrupts the initiation but not the execution of on-line adjustments to a perturbation of object size.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15701244", "authors": ["Glover, S", "Miall, RC", "Rushworth, MF"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "In 76 patients undergoing skull base surgery, mpTES was delivered through electrodes 1cm anterior to C1 and C2 (M1-M2), C3 and C4 (M3-M4) or C3 or C4 and Cz (M3/M4-Mz), with the anode contralateral to the operative side.
