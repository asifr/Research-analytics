All patients had a hemiparesis contralateral to the lesion. It was the aim of our study to define the diagnostic significance of MEP with respect to superficial and deep localization of the lesions. To achieve this goal, MEP findings were correlated with the clinical motor status defining two categories: correct with pathological MEP, and false-negative with normal MEP. On the whole, we found correct results in 108 of 122 patients (88.5%) with electrical stimulation, and in 67 of 75 patients (89.3%) with magnetoelectric stimulation. There were false-negative results in 4 (11.5%) and 8 (10.7%) cases, respectively. In particular, with electrical stimulation 14 of 65 (21.5%), and with magnetoelectric stimulation 8 of 43 (18.6%) superficial lesions were missed, whereas deep lesions were correctly assessed in every case by either stimulation technique. In conclusion, the diagnostic significance of MEP for assessment of superficial supratentorial lesions is limited with the methods applied in this study. Whether more refined techniques may provide different results in a similar setting remains to be proved.", "pages": "33-40"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Inhibition of muscle sympathetic outflow following transcranial cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "9531445", "authors": ["Macefield, VG", "Taylor, JL", "Wallin, BG"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of the autonomic nervous system", "abstract": "The possible contribution of cerebral cortical activity to sympathetic outflow to the muscle vascular bed was assessed in normal human subjects. Muscle sympathetic activity was recorded from motor fascicles of the peroneal nerve in 8 subjects while transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the vertex, or unilaterally over the hand area of cortex. By triggering the cortical stimulus from the R-wave of the ECG and introducing delays of 0-600 ms between the trigger and the stimulus, we found that a single cortical stimulus delayed by 200-400 ms caused a pronounced inhibition of one pulse-synchronous sympathetic burst. Stimulation over the vertex was more effective than stimulation over the hand area of cortex. In addition to this inhibition of muscle sympathetic outflow, brain stimulation caused an increase in cutaneous sympathetic activity, both sudomotor (sweating) and vasoconstrictor (decrease in skin blood flow). We suggest that the cerebral cortex may normally suppress muscle sympathetic outflow and speculate that lesions that interrupt this source of inhibition (such as those caused by stroke) may result in an augmented muscle sympathetic outflow.", "pages": "33-40"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Treatment with electromagnetic fields improves dual-task performance (talking while walking) in multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "9522259", "authors": ["Sandyk, R"], "year": "1997", "journal": "The International journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with an increased risk of falling resulting from visual disturbances, difficulties with gait and balance, apraxia of gait and peripheral neuropathy. These factors often interact synergistically to compromise the patient's gait stability. It has long been recognized that walking involves a cognitive component and that simultaneous cognitive and motor operations (dual-task) such as talking while walking may interfere with normal ambulation. Talking while walking reflects an example of a dual-task which is frequently impaired in MS patients. Impaired dual-task performance during walking may compromise the patient's gait and explain why in some circumstances, MS patients unexpectedly lose their balance and fall. Frontal lobe dysfunction, which commonly occurs in MS patients, may disrupt dual-task performance and increase the risk of falling in these patients. This report concerns a 36 old man with remitting-progressive MS with an EDSS score of 5.5 who experienced marked increase in spasticity in the legs and trunk and worsening of his gait and balance, occasionally resulting in falling, when talking while walking. His gait and balance improved dramatically after he received two successive transcranial treatments, each of 45 minutes, with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 7.5 picotesla flux density. Simultaneously, there was improvement in dual-task performance to the extent that talking while walking did not adversely affect his ambulation. In addition, neuropsychological testing revealed an almost 5-fold increase in word output on the Thurstone's Word-Fluency Test, which is sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction. It is suggested that facilitation of dual-task performance during ambulation contributes to the overall improvement of gait and balance observed in MS patients receiving transcranial treatment with AC pulsed EMFs.", "pages": "33-40"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Speech impairment in Parkinson's disease is improved by transcranial application of electromagnetic fields.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "9522256", "authors": ["Sandyk, R"], "year": "1997", "journal": "The International journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "A 52 year old fully medicated physician with juvenile onset Parkinsonism experienced 4 years ago severe \"on-off\" fluctuations in motor disability and debilitating speech impairment with severe stuttering which occurred predominantly during \"on-off\" periods. His speech impairment improved 20%-30% when sertraline (75 mg/day), a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was added to his dopaminergic medications which included levodopa, amantadine, selegiline and pergolide mesylate. A more dramatic and consistent improvement in his speech occurred over the past 4 years during which time the patient received, on a fairly regular basis, weekly transcranial treatments with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of picotesla flux density. Recurrence of speech impairment was observed on several occasions when regular treatments with EMFs were temporarily discontinued. These findings demonstrate that AC pulsed applications of picotesla flux density EMFs may offer a nonpharmacologic approach to the management of speech disturbances in Parkinsonism. Furthermore, this case implicates cerebral serotonergic deficiency in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonian speech impairment which affects more than 50% of patients. It is believed that pulsed applications of EMFs improved this patient's speech impairment through the facilitation of serotonergic transmission which may have occurred in part through a synergistic interaction with sertraline.", "pages": "33-40"}, {"volume": "506 ( Pt 3)", "title": "Sensorimotor modulation of human cortical swallowing pathways.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9503343", "authors": ["Hamdy, S", "Aziz, Q", "Rothwell, JC", "Hobson, A", "Thompson, DG"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over motor areas of cerebral cortex in man can activate short latency bilateral cortical projections to the pharynx and oesophagus. In the present paper we investigate the interaction between pathways from each hemisphere and explore how activity in these pathways is modulated by afferent feedback from the face, pharynx and oesophagus. 2. Comparison of unilateral and bilateral stimulation (using interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1, 5 or 10 ms between shocks) showed spatial summation of responses from each hemisphere at an ISI of 1 ms, indicating that cortical efferents project onto a shared population of target neurones. Such summation was not evident at ISIs of 5 or 10 ms. There was little evidence for transcallosal inhibition of responses from each hemisphere, as described for limb muscles. 3. Single stimuli applied to the vagus nerve in the neck or the supraorbital nerve, which alone produce intermediate (onset 20-30 ms) and long (50-70 ms) latency reflex responses in the pharynx and oesophagus, were used to condition the cortical responses. Compared with rest, responses evoked by cortical stimulation were facilitated when they were timed to coincide with the late part of the reflex. The onset latency was reduced during both parts of the reflex response. No facilitation was observed with subthreshold reflex stimuli. 4. Single electrical stimuli applied to the pharynx or oesophagus had no effect on the response to cortical stimulation. However, trains of stimuli at frequencies varying from 0.2 to 10 Hz decreased the latency of the cortically evoked responses without consistently influencing their amplitudes. The effect was site specific: pharyngeal stimulation shortened both pharyngeal and oesophageal response latencies, whereas oesophageal stimulation shortened only the oesophageal response latencies. 5. Cortical swallowing motor pathways from each hemisphere interact and their excitability is modulated in a site-specific manner by sensory input. The latter may produce a mixture of excitation and inhibition at both brainstem and cortical levels.", "pages": "33-40"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "\"Threshold-level\" multipulse transcranial electrical stimulation of motor cortex for intraoperative monitoring of spinal motor tracts: description of method and comparison to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "509218", "authors": ["Calancie, B", "Harris, W", "Broton, JG", "Alexeeva, N", "Green, BA"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Numerous methods have been pursued to evaluate function in central motor pathways during surgery in the anesthetized patient.

After anesthesia had been induced and the patient positioned, but prior to incision, \"baseline\" measures of SSEPs were obtained as well as the minimum (that is, threshold-level) TES voltage needed to evoke a motor response from each of the muscles being monitored. A brief, high-frequency pulse train (three pulses; 2-msec interpulse interval) was used for TES in all cases. Data (latency and amplitude for SSEP; threshold voltage for TES) were collected at different times throughout the surgical procedure. Postoperative neurological status, as judged by evaluation of sensory and motor status, was compared with intraoperative SSEP and TES findings for determination of the sensitivity and specificity of each electrophysiological monitoring technique. Of the 34 patients enrolled, 32 demonstrated TES-evoked responses in muscles innervated at levels caudal to the lesion when examined after anesthesia induction and positioning but prior to incision (that is, baseline). In contrast, baseline SSEPs could be resolved in only 25 of the 34 patients. During surgery, significant changes in SSEP waveforms were noted in 12 of these 25 patients, and 10 patients demonstrated changes in TES thresholds. Fifteen patients experienced varying degrees and durations of postoperative neurological deficit. Intraoperative changes in TES thresholds accurately predicted each instance of postoperative motor weakness without error, but failed to predict four instances of postoperative sensory deficit. Intraoperative SSEP monitoring was not 100% accurate in predicting postoperative sensory status and failed to predict five instances of postoperative motor deficit. As a result of intraoperative TES findings, the surgical plan was altered or otherwise influenced in six patients (roughly 15% of the sample population), possibly limiting the extent of postoperative motor deficit experienced by these patients.", "pages": "33-40"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "Risk and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: report and suggested guidelines from the International Workshop on the Safety of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, June 5-7, 1996.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "1464843", "authors": ["Wassermann, EM"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "This novel method for intraoperative monitoring of spinal motor conduction appears to meet all of the goals outlined above.
