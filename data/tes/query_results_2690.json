Previously, we revealed that brain endorphinergic structures have quasiresonance characteristics. On the basis of these data, a method of activation of the brain endorphinergic structures by means of noninvasive and rather selective transcranial electrostimulation (TES) as a kind of functional electrical stimulation (FES) was elaborated. New models of TES devices (TRANSAIR) were developed for indoor and outdoor usage. To increase the efficacy of TES, the frequency modulation according to normal distribution in the limits of the quasiresonance characteristics was put into operation. The blind and placebo-controlled (passive and active placebo) study was produced to estimate the TES effects on stress events and accompanied psycho-physiological and autonomic disturbances of different intensities on volunteers and patients in the following groups: everyday stress and fatigue; stress in regular military service and in field conditions; stress in the relatives of those lost in mass disaster; posttraumatic stress (thermal burns); and affective disorders in a postabstinence period. Some subjective verbal and nonverbal tests and objective tests (including heart rate variability) were used for estimation of the initial level of psycho-physiological status, which changes after TES sessions. It was demonstrated that fatigue, stress, and other accompanied psycho-physiological disturbances were significantly improved or abolished after 2-5 TES sessions. The TES effects were more pronounced in cases of heavier disturbances. In conclusion, activation of the brain endorphinergic structures by TES is an effective homeostatic method of FES that sufficiently improves quality of life.", "pages": "324-40"}, {"volume": "103", "title": "[Present condition and future prospects for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy].", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "11685398", "authors": ["Takigawa, M"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica", "abstract": "Participants practiced two discrete six-key sequences for a total of 420 trials. The 1 x 6 sequence had a unique order of key presses while the 2 x 3 sequence involved repetition of a three-key segment. Both sequences showed a long interkey interval halfway the sequence indicating hierarchical sequence control in that not only the 2 x 3 but also the 1 x 6 sequence was executed as two successive motor chunks. Besides, the second part of both sequences was executed faster than the first part. This supports the earlier notion of a motor processor executing the elements of familiar motor chunks and a cognitive processor triggering either these motor chunks or individual sequence elements. Low-frequency, off-line transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) counteracted normal improvement with practice of key presses at all sequence positions. Together, these results are in line with the notion that with moderate practice, the SMA executes short sequence fragments that are concatenated by other brain structures.", "pages": "324-40"}, {"volume": "143", "title": "Cortical excitability and motor task in man: an investigation of the wrist extensor motor area.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11682355", "authors": ["Aimonetti, JM", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
