Although rTMS is being evaluated as a possible alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of refractory depression, little is known about the pattern of activation induced in the brain by rTMS. We have compared immediate early gene expression in rat brain after rTMS and electroconvulsive stimulation, a well-established animal model for electroconvulsive therapy. Our result shows that rTMS applied in conditions effective in animal models of depression induces different patterns of immediate-early gene expression than does electroconvulsive stimulation. In particular, rTMS evokes strong neural responses in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) and in other regions involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. The response in PVT is independent of the orientation of the stimulation probe relative to the head. Part of this response is likely because of direct activation, as repetitive magnetic stimulation also activates PVT neurons in brain slices.", "pages": "15635-40"}, {"volume": "257", "title": "Transcranial laser doppler mapping of activation flow coupling of the rat somatosensory cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "2019645", "authors": ["Ances, BM", "Detre, JA", "Takahashi, K", "Greenberg, JH"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Signal averaged laser Doppler (LD) through a thinned skull over the rat somatosensory cortex was used to map the spatial and temporal characteristics of activation-flow coupling, the change in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to neuronal activation, in response to electrical forepaw stimulation.

This location is very similar but slightly posterior and lateral to results obtained from electrophysiological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optical imaging studies.

However, the mechanisms underlying the antidepressive action of rTMS are widely unclear. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been shown to play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. In the present study we demonstrate that rTMS delays the first REM sleep epoch on average by 17 min (102.6 +/-22.5 min vs 85.7+/-18.8 min; p < 0.02) and prolongs the nonREM-REM cycle length (109.1+/-11.4 min vs 101.8+/-13.2min, p< 0.012). These rTMS-induced changes in REM sleep variables correspond to findings observed after pharmacological and electroconvulsive treatment of depression. Therefore, it is likely that the capability of rTMS to affect circadian and ultradian biological rhythms contributes to its antidepressive action.", "pages": "15635-40"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation delays rapid eye movement sleep.", "keywords": [], "issue": "15", "pmid": "2230801", "authors": ["Cohrs, S", "Tergau, F", "Riech, S", "Kastner, S", "Paulus, W", "Ziemann, U", "R\u00fcther, E", "Hajak, G"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "The present experiments were designed to compare the understanding of the transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation of the human motorcortex.", "pages": "15635-40"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Comparison of descending volleys evoked by transcranial magnetic and electric stimulation in conscious humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "2546177", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Oliviero, A", "Profice, P", "Saturno, E", "Pilato, F", "Insola, A", "Mazzone, P", "Tonali, P", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The spinal volleys evoked by single transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation over the cerebral motor cortex were recorded from a bipolar electrode inserted into the cervical epidural space of two conscious human subjects.

Recurrent episodes of uncontrollable yawning and body stretching, identical to those observed upon awakening from physiological sleep, occur in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during transcranial therapeutic application of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields of picotesla flux density. This behavioral response has been observed exclusively in young female patients who are fully ambulatory with a relapsing remitting course of the disease who also demonstrate a distinctly favorable therapeutic response to magnetic stimulation.
