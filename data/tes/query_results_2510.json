Both our own experience and data published in the literature underline the value of the method in localising facial nerve dysfunction and its role in clinical diagnosis. It is non-invasive and easy to perform. Canalicular hypoexcitability has proved to be the most useful and sensitive parameter, which indicates the dysfunction of the nerve between the brain stem and the facial canal. This is an electrophysiological finding which offers for the first time positive criteria for the diagnosis of Bell's palsy. The absence of canalicular hypoexcitability practically excludes the possibility of Bell's palsy. The technique is also able to demonstrate subclinical dysfunction of the nerve, which can be of considerable help in the etiological diagnosis of facial palsies. For example, in a situation where clinically unilateral facial weakness is observed, but facial nerve neurography demonstrates bilateral involvement, etiologies other than Bell's palsy are more likely, such as Lyme's disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningeal affections etc. Furthermore, the technique differentiates reliably between peripheral facial nerve lesion involving the segment in the brain stem or the segment after leaving the brainstem.", "pages": "356-67"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Modulation of motor cortex excitability by pallidal stimulation in patients with severe dystonia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12629231", "authors": ["K\u00fchn, AA", "Meyer, BU", "Trottenberg, T", "Brandt, SA", "Schneider, GH", "Kupsch, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To study the influence of continuous high-frequency electrical stimulation with electrodes implanted in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) on motor cortex excitability in nine patients with dystonia.", "pages": "356-67"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "A temporally asymmetric Hebbian rule governing plasticity in the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "12612033", "authors": ["Wolters, A", "Sandbrink, F", "Schlottmann, A", "Kunesch, E", "Stefan, K", "Cohen, LG", "Benecke, R", "Classen, J"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Short-term effects related to switching off and on the deep brain stimulator were investigated >3 months after electrode implantation.

Human motor cortical excitability can be increased by a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol. Here we show that it can also be decreased by minimally changing the interval between the two associative stimuli. Corticomotor excitability of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) representation was tested before and after repetitively pairing of single right median nerve simulation with single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered over the optimal site for activation of the contralateral APB. Following PAS, depression of TMS-evoked motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) was induced only when the median nerve stimulation preceded the TMS pulse by 10 ms, while enhancement of cortical excitability was induced using an interstimulus interval of 25 ms, suggesting an important role of the sequence of cortical events triggered by the two stimulation modalities. Experiments using F-wave studies and electrical brain stem stimulation indicated that the site of the plastic changes underlying the decrease of MEP amplitudes following PAS (10 ms) was within the motor cortex. MEP amplitudes remained depressed for approximately 90 min. The decrease of MEP amplitudes was blocked when PAS(10 ms) was performed under the influence of dextromethorphan, an N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist, or nimodipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antagonist. The physiological profile of the depression of human motor cortical excitability following PAS(10 ms) suggests long-term depression of synaptic efficacy to be involved. Together with earlier findings, this study suggests that strict temporal Hebbian rules govern the induction of long-term potentiation/long-term depression-like phenomena in vivo in the human primary motor cortex.", "pages": "356-67"}, {"volume": "149", "title": "Focal reduction of intracortical inhibition in the motor cortex by selective proprioceptive stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12592499", "authors": ["Rosenkranz, K", "Pesenti, A", "Paulus, W", "Tergau, F"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Experimental brain research. Experimentelle Hirnforschung. Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Motor cortex stimulation has both excitatory and inhibitory effects on ipsilateral muscles. Excitatory effects can be assessed by ipsilateral motor-evoked potentials (iMEPs). Inhibitory effects include an interruption of ipsilateral voluntary muscle activity known as the silent period (iSP) and a reduction in corticospinal excitability evoked by conditioning stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex (interhemispheric inhibition, IHI). Both iSP and IHI may be mediated by transcallosal pathways. Their relationship to the contralateral corticospinal projection and whether iSP and IHI represent the same phenomenon remain unclear. The neuronal population activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is highly dependent on the direction of the induced current in the brain. We examined the relationship among iMEP, iSP, IHI, and the contralateral corticospinal system by examining the effects of different stimulus intensities and current directions. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from both first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. The iSP in the right FDI muscle was obtained by right motor cortex stimulation during voluntary muscle contraction. IHI was examined by conditioning stimulation of the right motor cortex followed by test stimulation of the left motor cortex at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2-80 ms. The induced current directions tested in the right motor cortex were anterior medial (AM), posterior medial (PM), posterior lateral, and anterior lateral (AL). Contralateral MEPs (cMEPs) had the lowest threshold with the AM direction and the shortest latency with the PM direction. iMEPs were present in 8 of 10 subjects. Both iMEP and IHI did not show significant directional preference. iSP was observed in all subjects with the highest threshold for the AL direction and the longest duration for the AM direction. cMEP, iSP, and IHI all increased with stimulus intensity up to approximately 75% stimulator output. Target muscle activation decreased IHI at 8-ms ISI but had little effect on IHI at 40-ms ISI. iSP and IHI at 8-ms ISI did not correlate at any stimulus intensities and current directions tested, and factor analysis showed that they are explained by different factors. However, active IHI at 40-ms ISI was explained by the same factor as iSP. The different directional preference for cMEP compared with iMEP and IHI suggests that these ipsilateral effects are mediated by populations of cortical neurons that are different from those activating the corticospinal neurons. iSP and IHI do not represent the same phenomenon and should be considered complementary measures of ipsilateral inhibition.", "pages": "356-67"}, {"volume": "149", "title": "Modulation of intracortical neuronal circuits in human hand motor area by digit stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12592498", "authors": ["Kobayashi, M", "Ng, J", "Th\u00e9oret, H", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
