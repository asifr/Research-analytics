The motor cortex was spatially mapped using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after 2 weeks of treatment. Motor-output areas of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and location of centre of gravity (CoG) of motor cortex output were studied. After CI therapy, motor performance improved substantially in all patients. There was also an increase of motor output area size and MEP amplitudes, indicating enhanced neuronal excitability in the damaged hemisphere for the target muscles. The mean centre of gravity of the motor output maps was shifted considerably after the rehabilitation, indicating the recruitment of motor areas adjacent to the original location. Thus, even in chronic stroke patients, reduced motor cortex representations of an affected body part can be enlarged and increased in level of excitability by an effective rehabilitation procedure. The data therefore demonstrate a CNS correlate of therapy-induced recovery of function after nervous system damage in humans.", "pages": "5-8"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Polarization of the human motor cortex through the scalp.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "9694210", "authors": ["Priori, A", "Berardelli, A", "Rona, S", "Accornero, N", "Manfredi, M"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Direct currents (DC) applied directly to central nervous system structures produce substantial and long-lasting effects in animal experiments. We tested the functional effects of very weak scalp DC (< 0.5 mA, 7 s) on the human motor cortex by assessing the changes in motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic brain stimulation. We performed four different experiments in 15 healthy volunteers. Our findings led to the conclusion that such weak (< 0.5 mA) anodal scalp DC, alternated with a cathodal DC, significantly depresses the excitability of the human motor cortex, providing evidence that a small electric field crosses the skull and influences the brain. A possible mechanism of action of scalp DC is the hyperpolarization of the superficial excitatory interneurones in the human motor cortex.", "pages": "5-8"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Surgical monitoring of motor pathways.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9681557", "authors": ["Burke, D", "Hicks, RG"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Intraoperative monitoring of corticospinal function is no longer an experimental technique, having been introduced into routine practice in a number of centers, each of which has now accumulated large series of some hundreds of cases. Different techniques have been developed by these centers; each has advantages and disadvantages, and it is clear that no one technique in particular is optimal for all surgical procedures. The corticospinal system can be activated by transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex or by direct stimulation of the spinal cord with electrical or magnetic stimuli delivered singly or as double or multiple pulses. The evoked activity may be recorded directly from the spinal cord using epidural electrode, or as a postsynaptic volley in motor axons (\"neurogenic motor evoked potentials,\" MEP), or as a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from innervated muscles. For scoliosis surgery, we use transcranial electrical stimulation, recording the evoked volley from the spinal cord using epidural electrodes at two spinal levels. By simultaneously stimulating the tibial nerves in the popliteal fossae, descending corticospinal volleys and ascending somatosensory volleys can be recorded in the same sweep. Accordingly, this technique allows monitoring of two different modalities of function at two separate levels of the nervous system, a goal that is most desirable because it helps identify the earliest evidence of dysfunction and at the same time minimizes false-positive reports to the surgeon. Our technique has the advantage of being relatively immune to the depressant effects of anesthesia, and full muscle relaxation is possible--even desirable. More peripheral recordings of neurogenic MEP or CMAP, are sensitive to the choice of anesthetic, and the latter requires incomplete curarization. However, these techniques may be appropriate when the pathology is in the low spinal cord or nerve roots.", "pages": "5-8"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "The effect of sevoflurane on myogenic motor-evoked potentials induced by single and paired transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex during nitrous oxide/ketamine/fentanyl anesthesia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "9681555", "authors": ["Kawaguchi, M", "Inoue, S", "Kakimoto, M", "Kitaguchi, K", "Furuya, H", "Morimoto, T", "Sakaki, T"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology", "abstract": "To overcome anesthetic-induced depression of myogenic motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), several techniques of stimulation using paired pulses or trains of pulses are used. This study investigated the effect of sevoflurane on myogenic MEPs induced by single and paired transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex. Nine patients undergoing elective spinal surgery were anesthetized with fentanyl-N2O-ketamine. Partial neuromuscular blockade (single-twitch height 15% of baseline) was maintained with vecuronium. Single and paired (interstimulus interval 2 milliseconds) electrical stimuli were delivered to the scalp, and compound muscle action potentials were recorded from the left and right tibialis anterior muscles. In all patients, baseline MEPs were recorded from both the left and right anterior tibialis muscles (in a total of 18 legs). During the administration of 0.25 MAC and 0.5 MAC sevoflurane, MEPs induced by stimulation with a single pulse could be recorded in 12 of 18 and 4 of 18 legs, respectively, and MEP amplitude was significantly reduced to 48% and 4% of the control value, respectively. During the administration of 0.75 MAC sevoflurane, MEPs following single-pulse stimulation could not be recorded in any legs. The success rate of MEP recording during the administration of sevoflurane was greater after paired stimulation than after single stimulation, and percentage MEP amplitude (percentage of the control value after single stimulation but before sevoflurane) after paired stimulation was significantly higher than after single stimulation before and during the administration of 0.25 MAC and 0.5 MAC sevoflurane. The success rate of MEP recording and MEP amplitude after paired stimulation decreased in a dose-dependent manner during the administration of sevoflurane. These results suggest that although facilitation by the second stimulus was considerable, paired stimuli are still not sufficient to overcome the depressant effects of sevoflurane in clinically used concentrations.", "pages": "5-8"}, {"volume": "511 ( Pt 1)", "title": "Demonstration of facilitatory I wave interaction in the human motor cortex by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "9681399", "authors": ["Ziemann, U", "Tergau, F", "Wassermann, EM", "Wischer, S", "Hildebrandt, J", "Paulus, W"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human motor cortex results in multiple discharges (D and I waves) in the corticospinal tract. We tested whether these volleys can be explored non-invasively with paired TMS. The intensity of the first stimulus (S1) was set to produce a motor-evoked potential (MEP) of 1 mV in the resting contralateral abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle; the second stimulus (S2) was set to 90 % of the resting motor threshold. At interstimulus intervals of 1.1-1.5, 2.3-2.9 and 4.1-4.4 ms the MEP elicited by S1 plus S2 was larger than that produced by S1 alone. 2. Varying the S1 intensity between 70 and 130 % resting motor threshold with S2 held constant at 90 % resting motor threshold showed that the threshold for the first MEP peak was <= 70 % resting motor threshold. The second and third MEP peaks appeared only at higher S1 intensities. The latency of all peaks decreased with increasing S1 intensity. 3. Varying the S2 intensity with S1 held constant to produce a MEP of 1 mV on its own showed that the amplitude of all MEP peaks increased with S2 intensity, but that their timing remained unchanged. 4. Paired TMS in the active ADM (S1 clearly suprathreshold, S2 just above threshold; interstimulus interval, 1 ms) produced strong MEP facilitation. The onset of this facilitation occurred later by about 1.5 ms than the onset of the MEP evoked by S2 alone. No MEP facilitation was seen if the magnetic S2 was replaced by anodal or cathodal transcranial electrical stimulation. 5. It is concluded that the MEP facilitation after paired TMS, at least for the first MEP peak, is due to facilitatory interaction between I waves, and takes place in the motor cortex at or upstream from the corticospinal neurone.", "pages": "5-8"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Ipsilateral motor activation in patients with cerebral gliomas.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9679173", "authors": ["Caramia, MD", "Telera, S", "Palmieri, MG", "Wilson-Jones, M", "Scalise, A", "Iani, C", "Giuffr\u00e8, R", "Bernardi, G"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to provide neurophysiologic evidence of ipsilateral hemispheric activation in patients affected by intracerebral gliomas via the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "5-8"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Influence of isoflurane on myogenic motor evoked potentials to single and multiple transcranial stimuli during nitrous oxide/opioid anesthesia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "3795092", "authors": ["Ubags, LH", "Kalkman, CJ", "Been, HD"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "The mechanisms involved in such ipsilateral activation have yet to be established, but they may involve preexisting routes that either are suppressed or undetected in the normal brain.
