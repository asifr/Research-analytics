When targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anodal, facilitatory tDCS has been shown to improve symptoms in a range of domains including working memory, mood, and pain perception (Boggio et al., 2008a; Dockery et al., 2009; Kalu et al., 2012). However, the mechanisms underlying these promising behavioral effects are not well understood. Here, we investigated brain perfusion changes, as assessed using whole-brain arterial spin labeling (ASL), during tDCS applied to the left DLPFC in healthy humans. We demonstrated increased perfusion in regions closely anatomically connected to the DLPFC during anodal tDCS in conjunction with a decreased functional coupling between the left DLPFC and the thalami bilaterally. Despite highly similar effects on cortical excitability during and after stimulation (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000, 2001), cortical perfusion changes were markedly different during these two time periods, with widespread decreases in cortical perfusion being demonstrated after both anodal and cathodal tDCS compared to the period during stimulation. These findings may at least partially explain the different effects on behavior in these time periods described previously in the motor system (Stagg et al., 2011). In addition, the data presented here provide mechanistic explanations for the behavioral effects of anodal tDCS applied to the left DLPFC in terms of modulating functional connectivity between the DLPFC and thalami, as has been hypothesized previously (Lorenz et al., 2003).", "pages": "11425-31"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Neurobiology and clinical implications of lucid dreaming.", "keywords": ["APB", "CoG", "EDSS", "EMG", "Expanded Disability Status Scale", "LQ", "M1", "MEP", "MS", "TENS", "TMS", "abductor pollicis brevis", "center of gravity", "cortical motor representation", "electromyographic", "fMRI", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "laterality quotient", "motor-evoked potential", "multiple sclerosis", "neural plasticity", "primary motor cortex", "rMT", "rest motor threshold", "transcranial magnetic stimulation", "transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation"], "issue": "5", "pmid": "23838126", "authors": ["Mota-Rolim, SA", "Araujo, JF"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "abstract": "Several lines of evidence converge to the idea that rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is a good model to foster our understanding of psychosis. Both REMS and psychosis course with internally generated perceptions and lack of rational judgment, which is attributed to a hyperlimbic activity along with hypofrontality. Interestingly, some individuals can become aware of dreaming during REMS, a particular experience known as lucid dreaming (LD), whose neurobiological basis is still controversial. Since the frontal lobe plays a role in self-consciousness, working memory and attention, here we hypothesize that LD is associated with increased frontal activity during REMS. A possible way to test this hypothesis is to check whether transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation of the frontal region during REMS triggers LD. We further suggest that psychosis and LD are opposite phenomena: LD as a physiological awakening while dreaming due to frontal activity, and psychosis as a pathological intrusion of dream features during wake state due to hypofrontality. We further suggest that LD research may have three main clinical implications. First, LD could be important to the study of consciousness, including its pathologies and other altered states. Second, LD could be used as a therapy for recurrent nightmares, a common symptom of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Finally, LD may allow for motor imagery during dreaming with possible improvement of physical rehabilitation. In all, we believe that LD research may clarify multiple aspects of brain functioning in its physiological, altered and pathological states.", "pages": "11425-31"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Neuropathic pain: transcranial electric motor cortex stimulation using high frequency random noise.

In an attempt to improve the post-operative outcomes and reduce known neurologic complications, we used discrete multimodality recording and stimulation models to identify areas of motor and sensory function in eighteen (18) pediatric patients presenting with Tibia Vara (Blount's Disease). By using both posterior tibial and peroneal nerves somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) with transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (TCeMEPs) precise status of sensory and motor pathways was possible during surgical correction. Similarly, spontaneous electromyography (s-EMG) and triggered electromyography (t-EMG) were used to more accurately localize nerve irritation. Concerns during tibial and fibular osteotomies included ipsilateral lower limb motor and sensory function, especially peroneal nerve injuries due to the location of the osteotomy at the fibular neck. Surgical interventions consisting of additional fibular resection were made during the index procedures for four patients because of real-time monitoring changes noted as the peroneal nerve was entrapped in three patients at the osteotomy site. In fourth patient, the tourniquet pressure was the cause for loss of ipsilateral SSEPs and TCeMEPs. After appropriate surgical intervention, monitoring parameters began to normalize and postoperatively the patients presented with no neurologic deficit. In this study, the application of multimodality recording and stimulation models were utilized including posterior tibial nerve and peroneal nerve SSEP with lumbar potential (LP) identification to compare with contralateral limb recordings. In addition, by using spontaneous and triggered EMG and TCeMEP, we were able to perform monitoring with a high level of confidence throughout surgery.", "pages": "11425-31"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation modulates large-scale cortical network activity by network resonance.", "keywords": [], "issue": "27", "pmid": "23825429", "authors": ["Ali, MM", "Sellers, KK", "Fr\u00f6hlich, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of a long-term transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment on cortical motor representation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
