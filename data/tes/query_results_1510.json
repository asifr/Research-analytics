In this study, we took advantage of the unusual grammatical characteristics of clitic pronouns in Italian (e.g., lo and la in portalo and portala 'bring it [masculine]/[feminine]', respectively)-the fact that clitics have both nominal and verbal characteristics, to explore the neural correlates of verb and clitic processing. We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to suppress the excitability of the left prefrontal cortex and to assess its role in producing verb+det+noun and verb+clitic phrases. Results showed an interference effect for both kinds of phrases when stimulation was applied to the left but not to the right prefrontal cortex. However, the interference effect was significantly greater for the verb+clitic than for the verb+det+noun phrases. These findings support the view that clitics increase the morphosyntactic complexity of verbs.", "pages": "113-21"}, {"volume": "1184", "title": "Preparatory suppression of the human primary motor cortex induced by repetition of simple and choice reaction time tasks: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "17961523", "authors": ["Kinoshita, H", "Yahagi, S", "Kasai, T"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed to investigate preparatory suppression of activity in the human primary motor cortex (M1) in relation to trial repetition of simple (SRT) and Go/NoGo choice RT (CRT) tasks. These tasks were performed in such a way that after a warning signal, the subjects (N=16) maintained 5% MVC isometric finger force against the force sensor to secure a facilitated state of M1. A response signal to generate pulsed force came at 2 s after the warning signal. TMS was given 1.5 s after the warning signal, and the amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the first dorsal interosseous muscle were evaluated during 30 repetitive trials over 3 sessions for each subject. For the SRT task, the MEP amplitude was significantly decreased from baseline values in all trials of the three sessions. For the CRT task, on the other hand, there was a clear decreasing trend of the MEP amplitude with trial at the first and second sessions. The mean MEP amplitude at the first session was clearly higher than the baseline while it decreased significantly and reached the value below the baseline at the third session. The findings indicate that active suppression of M1 activity is involved in the preparatory state for RT tasks and that the degree of this suppression can relate to trial experience. The effect is thus most likely a consequence of a rapid adaptive change with the central nervous system in optimizing the preparatory state of M1 for the upcoming motor response.", "pages": "113-21"}, {"volume": "1185", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation during voluntary action: directional facilitation of outputs and relationships to force generation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "17961516", "authors": ["Cros, D", "Soto, O", "Chiappa, KH"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human motor cortex evokes simple muscle jerks whose physiological significance is unclear. Indeed, in subjects performing a motor task, there is uncertainty as to whether TMS-evoked outputs reflect the ongoing behavior or, alternatively, a disrupted motor plan. Considering force direction and magnitude to reflect qualitative and quantitative features of the motor plan respectively, we studied the relationships between voluntary forces and those evoked by TMS. In five healthy adults, we recorded the isometric forces acting a hand joint and the electromyographic activity in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Responses obtained at rest were highly invariant. Evoked responses obtained while subjects generated static and dynamic contractions were highly codirectional with the voluntary forces. Such directional relationships were independent of stimulation intensity, stimulated cortical volume, or magnitude of voluntary force exerted. Dynamic force generation was associated with a marked increase in the magnitude of the evoked force that was linearly related to the rate of force generation. The timing of central conduction was different depending on functional role of the target muscle, as either agonist or joint fixator. These results indicate that the architecture of motor plans remain grossly undisrupted by cortical stimulation applied during voluntary motor behavior. The significant magnitude modulation of responses during dynamic force generation suggests an essential role of the corticospinal system in the specification of force changes. Finally, the corticospinal activation depends on the functional role assumed by the target muscle, either postural or agonist.", "pages": "113-21"}, {"volume": "166", "title": "Electrical stimulation of auditory and somatosensory cortices for treatment of tinnitus and pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "17956802", "authors": ["De Ridder, D", "De Mulder, G", "Menovsky, T", "Sunaert, S", "Kovacs, S"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "The efficacy of electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex using extradural implanted electrodes for treatment of tinnitus was studied in 12 patients suffering tinnitus. The effect of similar stimulation of the somatosensory cortex for treatment of neuropathic pain was studied in five patients. It was shown that patients with pure tone type of tinnitus experienced a significant 97% suppression on average while those who had noise type tinnitus only had non-significant 24% suppression. All patients with pain experienced a significant reduction of their pain (using a visual analog scale), and in four out of five it was clinically relevant, i.e., the patient is really helped by it. It is concluded that electrical stimulation of sensory cortices can be effective treatments of severe unilateral tinnitus and unilateral neuropathic pain in selected patients. The results suggest that similar pathophysiological mechanisms underlie some forms of these phantom sensations, and therefore, similar treatment such as electrical stimulation of the respective sensory cortices can suppress tinnitus and pain.", "pages": "113-21"}, {"volume": "166", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment of chronic tinnitus: clinical effects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "17956800", "authors": ["Kleinjung, T", "Steffens, T", "Londero, A", "Langguth, B"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method used to induce electrical current in the brain through impulses of strong magnetic fields applied externally.

Especially, positron emission tomography (PET) has been increasingly used in the last two decades to identify cortical networks, which are involved in the generation of various forms of chronic tinnitus. PET studies have confirmed that the anatomical location of the anomalies that cause many forms of tinnitus are regions of the brain that are normally involved in auditory processing as well as regions engaged in emotional processing. These findings have contributed to the development of new more causally oriented treatment strategies. In particular, identification of increased activity of the auditory cortex by PET has prompted the use of focal brain stimulation techniques such as electrical or transcranial magnetic stimulation in treatment of tinnitus. PET studies that map distinct neurochemical pathways and receptors by the use of specific ligands may in the future provide new possibilities for pharmacologically based treatment of some forms of tinnitus.", "pages": "113-21"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Altered control of the trapezius muscle in subjects with non-traumatic shoulder instability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "17950033", "authors": ["Alexander, CM"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Reflexes of shoulder girdle muscles such as trapezius are evoked from muscle afferents supplying the forearm and hand in healthy subjects.
