We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess changes in flexor carpi radialis (FCR) intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) in healthy humans undergoing 3 weeks of immobilization. Measurements were obtained at rest and during contraction (15% intensity). Central activation and the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) were also assessed. Strength decreased 43.2% +/- 6.1% following immobilization, and central activation also decreased (97.5% +/- 2.4% to 73.2% +/- 8.3%). No changes in ICF, SICI, or LICI were observed at rest; however, LICI was increased during contraction (67.5% +/- 6.9% to 53.1% +/- 6.7% of unconditioned response). The increase in LICI correlated with the loss of strength (r = -0.63). The H-reflex increased following immobilization. These findings suggest that immobilization increases intracortical inhibition during contraction, and this increase is primarily mediated by GABA(B) receptors.", "pages": "363-72"}, {"volume": "191", "title": "Generalized framework for stimulus artifact removal.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19154845", "authors": ["Erez, Y", "Tischler, H", "Moran, A", "Bar-Gad, I"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "Stimulation is extensively used in neuroscience research in diverse fields ranging from cognitive to clinical. Studying the effect of electrical and magnetic stimulation on neuronal activity is complicated by large stimulation-derived artifacts on the recording electrodes, which mask the spiking activity. Multiple studies have suggested a variety of solutions for the removal of artifacts and were typically directed at specific stimulation setups. In this study we introduce a generalized framework for stimulus artifacts removal, the Stimulus Artifact Removal Graphical Environment (SARGE). The framework provides an encapsulated environment for a multi-stage removal process, starting from the stimulus pulse detection, through estimation of the artifacts and their removal, and finally to signal reconstruction and the assessment of removal quality. The framework provides the user with subjective graphical and objective quantitative tools for assessing the resulting signal, and the ability to adjust the process to optimize the results. This extendable publicly available framework supports different types of stimulation, stimulation patterns and shapes, and a variety of artifact estimation methods. We exemplify the removal of artifacts generated by electrical micro- and macro-stimulation and magnetic stimulation and different stimulation protocols. The use of different estimation methods, such as averaging and function fitting is demonstrated, and the differences between them are discussed. Finally, the quality of removal is assessed and validated using quantitative measures and combined experimental-simulation studies. The framework marks a shift from \"algorithm\" and \"data\" centric approach to a \"workflow\" centric approach, thus introducing an innovative concept to the artifact removal process.", "pages": "363-72"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Electrified minds: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) as methods of non-invasive brain stimulation in neuropsychology--a review of current data and future implications.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "18787036", "authors": ["Utz, KS", "Dimova, V", "Oppenl\u00e4nder, K", "Kerkhoff, G"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive, low-cost and easy-to-use technique that can be applied to modify cerebral excitability. This is achieved by weak direct currents to shift the resting potential of cortical neurons. These currents are applied by attaching two electrodes (usually one anode and one cathode) to distinct areas of the skull. Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a variant of tDCS where the electrodes are attached to the mastoids behind the ears in order to stimulate the vestibular system. tDCS and GVS are safe when standard procedures are used. We describe the basic physiological mechanisms and application of these procedures. We also review current data on the effects of tDCS and GVS in healthy subjects as well as clinical populations. Significant effects of such stimulation have been reported for motor, visual, somatosensory, attentional, vestibular and cognitive/emotional function as well as for a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, both techniques may induce neuroplastic changes which make them promising techniques in the field of neurorehabilitation. A number of open research questions that could be addressed with tDCS or GVS are formulated in the domains of sensory and motor processing, spatial and nonspatial attention including neglect, spatial cognition and body cognition disorders, as well as novel treatments for various neuropsychological disorders. We conclude that the literature suggests that tDCS and GVS are exciting and easily applicable research tools for neuropsychological as well as clinical-therapeutic investigations.", "pages": "363-72"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Enhancing plasticity through repeated rTMS sessions: the benefits of a night of sleep.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "20417265", "authors": ["Cohen, DA", "Freitas, C", "Tormos, JM", "Oberman, L", "Eldaief, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated that corticospinal facilitation from 20Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was greater during a second rTMS session 24h after the first.
