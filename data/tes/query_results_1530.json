Two groups performing either a postural stability maintenance training (SMT) or a ballistic ankle strength training (BST) were compared to a non-training group. The hypothesis was that practicing of a self-initiated voluntary movement would facilitate cortico-spinal projections, while practicing fast automatic adjustments during stabilization of stance would reduce excitatory influence from the primary motor cortex. Training effects were expected to be confined to the practiced task. To test for training specificity, motor evoked potentials (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded at rest and during motor tasks that were similar to each training. Intracortical, cortico-spinal, as well as spinal parameters were assessed at rest and during these tasks. The results show high task and training specificity. Training effects were only observable during performance of the trained task. While MEP size was decreased in the SMT group for the trained tasks, MEP recruitment was increased in the BST group in the trained task only. The control group did not show any changes. Background electromyogram levels, M. soleus H-reflex amplitudes and intracortical parameters were unaltered. In summary, it is suggested that the changes of MEP parameters in both training groups, but not in the control group, reflect cortical motor plasticity. While cortico-spinal activation was enhanced in the BST group, SMT may be associated with improved motor control through increased inhibitory trans-cortical effects. Since spinal excitability remained unaltered, changes most likely occur on the supraspinal level.", "pages": "2451-5"}, {"volume": "183", "title": "Low frequency rTMS over posterior parietal cortex impairs smooth pursuit eye tracking.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17828394", "authors": ["Hutton, SB", "Weekes, BS"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Apart from efficacy, its safety as a clinical treatment must be considered before its widespread use can be advocated. All published, sham-controlled rTMS depression trials were reviewed for reported side-effects and outcomes of formal neuropsychological testing. In addition, all reports of seizures occurring with rTMS were reviewed. Other safety concerns (effects on hearing; headache, pain, induced currents in electrical circuits, histotoxicity, electromagnetic field exposure, psychiatric complications, safety in pregnancy) are discussed. Common side-effects were of a minor nature, e.g. headache. There was a low incidence of accidental seizures and induced hypomania, both of which were associated with identified risk factors for which subjects should be screened. Long-term effects of repeated rTMS sessions are as yet unknown. When given within recommended guidelines, the overall safety profile of rTMS is good, and supports its further development as a clinical treatment.", "pages": "2451-5"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Tissue heterogeneity as a mechanism for localized neural stimulation by applied electric fields.", "keywords": [], "issue": "18", "pmid": "17804884", "authors": ["Miranda, PC", "Correia, L", "Salvador, R", "Basser, PJ"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy(ECT) is one of the most important methods in treating depressive patients especially who can not be improved with medication.

Although the transmembrane potential induced during direct electric stimulation has already been the subject of a number of theoretical studies, an analytical solution for the magnetically induced transmembrane potential change is still unavailable. In addition, although several studies have analyzed the impact of stimulation parameters, including stimulation intensity and frequency, as well as coil design and position, on the amount of tissue polarization, the effects of tissue non-homogeneity on cell polarization have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we have derived an analytical expression for the transmembrane potential induced by a low-frequency magnetic field in a spherical neuronal structure. This model is representative of a spherical cell body or any neuronal structure of a similar shape. The model cell is located in an extracellular medium and possesses a low-conductive membrane and an internal cytoplasm. These three regions represent the basic tissue non-homogeneity of a neuron at a microscopic level. The sensitivity of the induced transmembrane potential to the coil position and to the geometrical and electrical parameters of the model structure was studied in a broad physiologically relevant range. Our results demonstrate that the structure is regionally polarized, with the pattern of polarization depending on the relative positioning between the model cell and the stimulation coil. In addition, both the geometrical and electrical parameters of the structure affect the amount of polarization. These results may be generalized to other neuronal tissues that possess similar non-homogenous properties, but different shapes, such as an axon. Our results support the idea that aside from coil design and position, tissue non-homogeneity could play an important role in determining the effects of magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "2451-5"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Multimodal evoked potentials of Kennedy's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "17803031", "authors": ["Lai, TH", "Soong, BW", "Chen, JT", "Chen, YY", "Lai, KL", "Wu, ZA", "Liao, KK"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

However, there is little direct neurophysiological evidence of aberrant long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in SCZ and little human evidence to establish a link between LTP to learning and memory. LTP was evaluated using a neurophysiological paradigm referred to as paired associative stimulation (PAS). PAS involves pairing of median nerve electric stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex (for abductor pollicis brevis muscle activation) delivered at 25-ms interstimulus interval. This pairing was delivered at a frequency of 0.1 Hz for 30 min. LTP was reflected by the change in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) before and after PAS. In addition, motor skill learning was assessed using the rotary pursuit task. Compared with healthy subjects, patients with SCZ demonstrated significant MEP facilitation deficits following PAS and impaired rotary-pursuit motor learning. Across all subjects there was a significant association between LTP and motor skill learning. These data provide evidence for disrupted LTP in SCZ, whereas the association between LTP with motor skill learning suggests that the deficits in learning and memory in SCZ may be mediated through disordered LTP.", "pages": "2451-5"}]
