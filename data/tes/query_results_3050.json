Well established in diagnostic electrophysiology, TMS is now being studied as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. Evidence suggests this technique is safe and acceptable to patients. The future may see the application of TMS in obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and mania. There is strong evidence that it will become an accepted treatment of depression.", "pages": "541-8"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "The effect of riluzole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a study with cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "10540016", "authors": ["Desiato, MT", "Palmieri, MG", "Giacomini, P", "Scalise, A", "Arciprete, F", "Caramia, MD"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "A population of 31 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was selected for a prospective open study based on treatment with riluzole. A neurophysiological evaluation was performed by means of single and paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The examined parameters, excitability threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) duration, silent period (SP) duration and time course of intracortical inhibition to paired TMS after 6 months treatment, were matched against those recorded from the patients themselves before the beginning of treatment and from 20 (single TMS) or 10 (paired TMS) age-matched control subjects. Normal behaviour of the SP in response to increasing TMS was found in the treated patients; they showed a significant linear correlation between these two parameters (r=0.96) comparable to that calculated for controls (r=0.98), and significantly different with respect to drug-free patients (r=0.8, P=0.014). A significant reduced size of the 'conditioned' MEPs to paired stimulation was documented in the treated patients compared with the untreated patients (P=0.002). Our neurophysiological contribution to the assessment of the effect of riluzole on the motor cortical inhibitory property in ALS may be considered a setting for controlled trials in extended patient series, even in a pre-clinical phase.", "pages": "541-8"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Cortical silent period in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "10540015", "authors": ["Siciliano, G", "Manca, ML", "Sagliocco, L", "Pastorini, E", "Pellegrinetti, A", "Sartucci, F", "Sabatini, A", "Murri, L"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a muscle contraction induces a motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the skeletal muscle followed by a cessation of EMG activity, the cortical silent period (C-SP). The C-SP is a useful parameter to indicate the activation of the motor system. Accurate determination of the C-SP can be important in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive disorder of unknown etiology characterised by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of C-SP as an index of motor system involvement, in ten patients affected by ALS, with a mean duration of the disease: 5. 5+/-3.4 months, by means of an objective computer-aided method to measure C-SP and its relationship to stimulation intensity. C-SP duration was significantly reduced in ALS patients compared to controls at low stimulation intensity corresponding to an MEP threshold increased by 15%. While in less severely affected patients C-SP duration approached control values at higher stimulation intensities (25 and 50% upper MEP threshold), in more severe ALS subjects it showed a further reduction, allowing them to be discriminated.", "pages": "541-8"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Resetting of orthostatic tremor associated with cerebellar cortical atrophy by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "10593305", "authors": ["Manto, MU", "Setta, F", "Legros, B", "Jacquy, J", "Godaux, E"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Archives of neurology", "abstract": "To investigate the resetting effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation over motor cortex on orthostatic tremor, characterized by high-frequency electromyographic discharges in weight-bearing muscles, particularly orthostatic tremor (OT) associated with cerebellar cortical atrophy; and to compare our results with those obtained in primary OT, for which transcranial magnetic stimulation does not reset tremor.", "pages": "541-8"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "Characterisation of paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation conditions yielding intracortical inhibition or I-wave facilitation using a threshold-hunting paradigm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10591905", "authors": ["Awiszus, F", "Feistner, H", "Urbach, D", "Bostock, H"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It was shown recently that with short-interval, paired-pulse TMS a facilitation - called intracortical I-wave facilitation - can also be demonstrated. It was the aim of this study to investigate which stimulus conditions lead to intracortical inhibition and what conditions yield an intracortical I-wave facilitation in a hand muscle of normal subjects. Paired-pulse TMS responses with an interstimulus interval of 1.2 ms were obtained from the abductor digiti minimi muscle of four normal subjects. A threshold-hunting paradigm with hunting through first or second stimulus variation was used to obtain a curve of threshold-pair strengths. All subjects showed two branches of stimulus interaction on this diagram. If the first stimulus of a threshold pair was below approximately 65% of resting motor threshold it modified the response primarily due to the second stimulus through intracortical inhibition. However, if the first stimulus of a threshold pair exceeded approximately 65% of resting motor threshold it became responsible for the spinal action-potential initiation. The subsequent second stimulus served as a \"booster\" for the ongoing intracortical I-wave activity, making it impossible to observe the intracortical inhibition evoked by the first stimulus.", "pages": "541-8"}]
