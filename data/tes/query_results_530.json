In recent years, considerable knowledge has been accumulated about the physiology of\u00a0several of these facilitatory and inhibitory processes individually. However, activity in the corresponding neural circuits is not independent of each other. This paper reviews the experiments using triple-pulse TMS that are specifically designed to study interactions between intracortical circuits. These studies have provided evidence for a complex network of interconnected neural circuits within and across cerebral hemispheres. The current knowledge about the functional organization of this network, its pharmacology and functional implications for human motor control are discussed in detail. These findings have clinical relevance because specific interactions between neural circuits may be impaired in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We conclude that triple-pulse TMS studies will help to integrate and better understand the physiologic processes involved in human motor behavior.", "pages": "281-93"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Tolerability of transcranial direct current stimulation in childhood-onset schizophrenia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "22032743", "authors": ["Mattai, A", "Miller, R", "Weisinger, B", "Greenstein, D", "Bakalar, J", "Tossell, J", "David, C", "Wassermann, EM", "Rapoport, J", "Gogtay, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "In recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used to study and treat many neuropsychiatric conditions.
