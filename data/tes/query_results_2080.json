The motor pathways are via the nucleus ambiguous and possibly the nucleus retroambuigualis in the brainstem. In humans, activation of the cerebral cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation can cause motor potentials in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles and corresponding surface potentials. The relationships between the cortical sensation related to cough, the voluntary control of cough and the involvement of reflex pathways remain to be clarified.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in children and adolescents: a review and report of two cases of epilepsia partialis continua.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15564059", "authors": ["Morales, OG", "Henry, ME", "Nobler, MS", "Wassermann, EM", "Lisanby, SH"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America", "abstract": "Brain stimulation for the treatment of psychiatric disorders has received increasing attention over the past decade.

This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the use electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and magnetic seizure therapy in children and adolescents. Two cases of medically intractable epilepsia partialis continua are presented to add to the limited literature on the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in children and adolescents and illustrate the concept of using functional neuroimaging results to target the application of a focal intervention in an attempt to dampen hyperactive regions of the cortex.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Emerging brain-based interventions for children and adolescents: overview and clinical perspective.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15564050", "authors": ["Hirshberg, LM", "Chiu, S", "Frazier, JA"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America", "abstract": "Electroencephalogram biofeedback (EBF), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) are emerging interventions that attempt to directly impact brain function through neurostimulation and neurofeedback mechanisms.

The subjects had to press one of two buttons as quickly as possible after the go-signal. A precue preceding this conveyed full, partial or no advance information (hand and/or button), such that reaction time (RT) shortened with increasing amount of information. We gave TMS over each hemisphere at various time intervals (100-350 ms) after the go-signal and before the expected onset of response, and measured its effect on RT, movement time (MT) and error rate. At short intervals (100-200 ms), left hemisphere TMS delayed RT and prolonged MT of both hands, while right hemisphere TMS delayed RT only of the right hand, without affecting error rates. At long intervals (250-350 ms), TMS produced slightly more pronounced RT delays of the contralateral hand. RT was delayed more if the precues were less informative. The results suggest the importance of interhemispheric transmission of visuomotor information for motor implementation. The right hemisphere may play a role mainly in calculating target and effector information, determining RT, while the left hemisphere may play a role in elaborating the motor program and determining MT.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "65 Suppl 14", "title": "A qualitative analysis of nonresponse: management of treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15554782", "authors": ["Pallanti, S", "Hollander, E", "Goodman, WK"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of clinical psychiatry", "abstract": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), especially potent ones given at high doses over long periods of time, are often effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, a large percentage of patients do not respond to treatment with SRIs, and those who do respond often do not fully remit, which should be the standard goal of treatment in OCD. If a patient has been treated for several months and has not yet responded to treatment with several SRIs, the physician should perform a careful assessment of resistant and/or residual clinical symptoms and any comorbid conditions to determine which next-step treatment would be the most appropriate. One strategy for patients who have not responded to treatment with an SRI is to switch them to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, because some patients may respond better to agents that target multiple systems. Another promising approach is the augmentation of SRIs with neuroleptics. In addition, open trials have shown that intravenous (IV) clomipramine and IV citalopram may be effective in the treatment of resistant OCD. Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments and electroconvulsive therapy have been attempted, with mixed success. Recently, researchers have been studying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and neurosurgical approaches such as gamma knife capsulotomy and deep brain stimulation to learn if these procedures are effective in treating treatment-resistant OCD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has possibilities not only as a therapy but also as an instrument that can help researchers describe the neurocircuitries involved in OCD. More results are needed before the effectiveness of the nonpharmacologic treatments for OCD can be determined.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "161", "title": "Perception of non-voluntary brief contractions in normal subjects and in a deafferented patient.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15551086", "authors": ["Nicolas, G", "Marchand-Pauvert, V", "Lasserre, V", "Guihenneuc-Jovyaux, C", "Pierrot-Deseilligny, E", "Jami, L"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Twelve normal subjects and a well-known patient lacking large-diameter afferent fibres (GL) performed estimation, production and reproduction tasks. Magnetic stimulation of the radial nerve and, in normal subjects, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex were used to produce weak brief non-voluntary twitches. In estimation tasks, the subjects had to ascribe verbal marks on a 1-5 scale to the forces of stimulation-induced twitches. Loose covariations of marks and forces were observed, while directions of force variations between successive twitches were relatively well detected. GL did less well than normal subjects in detecting directions of force variations. In production tasks, subjects had to produce twitches matching verbal command marks in a 1-5 range, with or without visual feedback. Performances of normal subjects and GL resembled those of estimation tasks and were not improved by visual feedback. In reproduction tasks, subjects had to duplicate stimulation-induced test twitches: first without visual feedback, second with and third again without. Large errors were observed but all subjects did better with visual feedback. In the third step, improvement with respect to the first one was significantly more marked with TMS than with peripheral stimulation. GL improved her performance in the third step, possibly because she could use information provided by group III and group IV afferents still present in her nerves. Altogether, for normal subjects (1) the performances in estimation tasks are consistent with the known behaviour of Golgi tendon organs as observed in animal experiments, and (2) results observed in reproduction tasks suggest that cortical stimulation might elicit, in addition to corticospinal activation of motoneurones, collateral discharges that could be stored as a memory of motor command.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "161", "title": "Long-lasting modulation of human motor cortex following prolonged transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of forearm muscles: evidence of reciprocal inhibition and facilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15551083", "authors": ["Tinazzi, M", "Zarattini, S", "Valeriani, M", "Romito, S", "Farina, S", "Moretto, G", "Smania, N", "Fiaschi, A", "Abbruzzese, G"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Most studies in humans mainly dealt with the effects of prolonged low-frequency peripheral nerve stimulation on motor cortical excitability, despite its being known from animal studies that high-frequency stimulation can also result in changes of the cortical excitability. To investigate the possible effects of high-frequency peripheral stimulation on motor cortical excitability we recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left motor cortex from the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) in normal subjects, before and after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of 30 min duration applied over the FCR. The amplitude of MEPs from the FRC was significantly reduced from 10 to 35 min after TENS while the amplitude of MEPs from ECR was increased. No effects were observed in the FDI muscle. Indices of peripheral nerve (M-wave) and spinal cord excitability (H waves) did not change throughout the experiment. Electrical stimulation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve has no significant effect on motor cortex excitability. These findings suggest that TENS of forearm muscles can induce transient reciprocal inhibitory and facilitatory changes in corticomotoneuronal excitability of forearm flexor and extensor muscles lasting several minutes. These changes probably may occur at cortical site and seem to be mainly dependent on stimulation of muscle afferents. These findings might eventually lead to practical applications in rehabilitation, especially in those syndromes in which the excitatory and inhibitory balance between agonist and antagonist is severely impaired, such as spasticity and dystonia.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "159", "title": "Motor skill training induces changes in the excitability of the leg cortical area in healthy humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "15549279", "authors": ["Perez, MA", "Lungholt, BK", "Nyborg, K", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In this study, we investigated the effect of a 32-min period of motor skill, non-skill and passive training involving the ankle muscles on leg motor cortical excitability in healthy humans. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at a range of intensities was applied to obtain a recruitment curve of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle before and after training. We also explored the effect of training on inhibitory and facilitatory cortical circuits by using a paired-pulse TMS technique at intervals of 2.5 ms (short-interval intracortical inhibition, SICI) and 8 ms (intracortical facilitation, ICF). During motor skill training, subjects were instructed to make a cursor follow a series of target lines on a computer screen by performing voluntary ankle dorsi- and plantarflexion movements. Non-skill and passive training consisted of repeated voluntary and assisted dorsi- and plantarflexion movements, respectively. Recruitment curves increased significantly after 32 min of motor skill training but not after non-skill and passive training, suggesting that only skill motor training increases motor cortical excitability. Motor skill training was not accompanied by any changes in the recruitment curves of TA MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation, suggesting that the increased MEPs to TMS was likely caused by changes in excitability at a cortical site. SICI was decreased after 32 min of motor skill training but no changes were observed in ICF. We conclude that similar plastic changes as have previously been reported for the hand motor following motor skill training may also be observed for the leg motor area. The observed plastic changes appeared to be related to the degree of difficulty in the motor task, and may be of relevance for rehabilitation of gait disorders.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "Seizure incidence during single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in individuals with epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "15546781", "authors": ["Schrader, LM", "Stern, JM", "Koski, L", "Nuwer, MR", "Engel, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We reviewed published data and our own data to determine a quantitative incidence of seizure in subjects with epilepsy undergoing single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS and ppTMS) and to explore conditions that may increase this risk.", "pages": "431-4"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation in cognition and neuropsychology].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15538312", "authors": ["Verdon, CM", "Saba, G", "Januel, D"], "year": "", "journal": "L'Enc\u00e9phale", "abstract": "A PubMed literature search was performed, and articles from this search were reviewed.
