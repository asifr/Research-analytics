To evaluate the role of the cerebellum in recognising facial expressions we delivered transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex. A facial emotion recognition task was administered to 21 healthy subjects before and after cerebellar tDCS; we also tested subjects with a visual attention task and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for mood. Anodal and cathodal cerebellar tDCS both significantly enhanced sensory processing in response to negative facial expressions (anodal tDCS, p=.0021; cathodal tDCS, p=.018), but left positive emotion and neutral facial expressions unchanged (p>.05). tDCS over the right prefrontal cortex left facial expressions of both negative and positive emotion unchanged. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is specifically involved in processing facial expressions of negative emotion.", "pages": "786-99"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Increase in cortical pyramidal cell excitability accompanies depression-like behavior in mice: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "45", "pmid": "22072696", "authors": ["Sun, P", "Wang, F", "Wang, L", "Zhang, Y", "Yamamoto, R", "Sugai, T", "Zhang, Q", "Wang, Z", "Kato, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests that cortical excitability is increased in depressives. We investigated its cellular basis in a mouse model of depression. In a modified version of forced swimming (FS), mice were initially forced to swim for 5 consecutive days and then were treated daily with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or sham treatment for the following 4 weeks without swimming. On day 2 through day 5, the mice manifested depression-like behaviors. The next and last FS was performed 4 weeks later, which revealed a 4 week maintenance of depression-like behavior in the sham mice. In slices from the sham controls, excitability in cingulate cortex pyramidal cells was elevated in terms of membrane potential and frequencies of spikes evoked by current injection. Depolarized resting potential was shown to depend on suppression of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. This BK channel suppression was confirmed by measuring spike width, which depends on BK channels. Chronic rTMS treatment during the 4 week period significantly reduced the depression-like behavior. In slices obtained from the rTMS mice, normal excitability and BK channel activity were recovered. Expression of a scaffold protein Homer1a was reduced by the FS and reversed by rTMS in the cingulate cortex. Similar recovery in the same behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical features was observed after chronic imipramine treatment. The present study demonstrated that manifestation and disappearance of depression-like behavior are in parallel with increase and decrease in cortical neuronal excitability in mice and suggested that regulation of BK channels by Homer1a is involved in this parallelism.", "pages": "786-99"}, {"volume": "", "title": "The effects of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping during neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas of the brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "22071831", "authors": ["Adhikary, SD", "Thiruvenkatarajan, V", "Babu, KS", "Tharyan, P"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "abstract": "In patients presenting for surgical resection of lesions involving, or adjacent to, the functionally important eloquent cortical areas, it is vital to achieve complete or near complete resection of the pathology without damaging the healthy surrounding tissues.The eloquent areas that the surgeons are concerned with are the primary motor, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas.

If the lesions are adjacent to the above mentioned areas, the normal anatomy would get distorted. However, proper identification of the above mentioned areas would enable the surgeon to radically remove the tumours.

However, this could lead to erroneous conclusions if evoked EMG responses contain significant contributions from neighboring muscles (i.e., due to \"cross-talk\"). We addressed this issue with a simple nerve stimulation method to provide quantitative information regarding the size of EMG cross-talk between muscles of the forearm and hand. Peak to peak amplitude of EMG responses to electrical stimulation of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves (i.e., M-waves) were plotted against stimulation intensity for four wrist muscles and two hand muscles (n = 12). Since electrical stimulation can selectively activate specific groups of muscles, the method can differentiate between evoked EMG arising from target muscles and EMG cross-talk arising from nontarget muscles. Intramuscular EMG responses to nerve stimulation and root mean square EMG produced during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the wrist were recorded for comparison. Cross-talk was present in evoked surface EMG responses recorded from all nontarget wrist (5.05-39.38% Mmax) and hand muscles (1.50-24.25% Mmax) and to a lesser degree in intramuscular EMG signals (\u223c3.7% Mmax). The degree of cross-talk was comparable for stimulus-evoked responses and voluntary activity recorded during MVC. Since cross-talk can make a considerable contribution to EMG responses in forearm and hand muscles, care is required to avoid misinterpretation of EMG data. The multiple nerve stimulation method described here can be used to quantify the potential contribution of EMG cross-talk in transcranial magnetic stimulation and reflex studies.", "pages": "786-99"}]
