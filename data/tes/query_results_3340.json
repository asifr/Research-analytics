Short-duration central peaks were observed in three subjects with spastic diplegia only. All subjects demonstrated reciprocal inhibition in TA following electrical stimulation of group I afferents to SOL, and all subjects with CP demonstrated strong activation of both TA and SOL in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Responses in SOL were stronger than those observed from controls. These data support the existence of abnormal corticospinal projections to soleus motor neurons in individuals with spastic CP. In spastic diplegia, short-term discharge synchrony between SOL and TA motor units may reflect abnormal interneuronal modulation at the spinal level. Abnormal corticospinal projections and/or modulation of spinal interneurons may contribute to the disordered movement patterns and co-activation observed in this population.", "pages": "787-96"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "[Increase in physical endurance following transcranial electrostimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "9081458", "authors": ["Meshavkin, VK", "Toropov, AV", "Kost, NV", "Il'inski\u012d, OB", "Surkina, ID", "Zozulia, AA"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Biulleten' eksperimental'no\u012d biologii i meditsiny", "abstract": "During motor imagery, to estimate changes in excitability of flexor carpi radialis muscle motoneurons of the spinal and cortical levels, electrical stimuli for recording H-reflex and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for recording motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were used.

The presenting motor manifestation in all patients was paresis in the legs, with slow progression to the upper extremities and finally to the bulbar muscles. The age of ALS onset varied from 20 to 94 years, with a mean of 44 years. Mean survival time was 13 years for the 11 deceased patients. However, this is probably biased and untypical (low) when compared with the disease duration in the surviving patients, and when considering other medical complications in the deceased patients. The rate of progression was highly variable, even within families. All patients showed signs of involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons. Other neurological features included painful muscle spasms and paraesthesiae in the lower extremities. Two-thirds of patients experienced difficulty with micturition. Electrophysiological studies confirmed the slow progression and spatial distribution of clinical symptoms in the peripheral motor system. Furthermore, [corrected] potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (MEP) were compared with those evoked by cervical or lumbosacral electrical stimulation and often revealed marked slowing of transmission in central motor pathways.

The distance between the two recording electrodes was 10 cm. The distal latency in response to TMS was calculated by subtracting the NAP latency from the CMAP latency. Distal latency was also measured by recording ADM responses to supramaximal electrical stimulation (ES) 10 cm proximal to the recording electrode. TMS-induced distal latency was significantly shorter during voluntary contraction than at rest (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between TMS-induced distal latency during contraction and ES-induced distal latency. TMS-induced distal latencies at rest and during contraction were correlated with the ES-induced distal latencies (r2 = 0.468, P = 0.028 and r2 = 0.769, P = 0.0009, respectively).

Also, SP duration increased from 165 +/- 37 ms to 231 +/- 32 ms (P < 0.01). Thus, during a fatiguing MVC both excitatory and inhibitory TMS-induced responses increased. TMS delivered during repeated brief 10% MVC contractions before and after a fatiguing MVC in 5 subjects, showed no change in MEP amplitude but SP duration was prolonged after MVC. This SP prolongation was focal to the exercised muscle. Silent periods recorded after pyramidal tract stimulation were unchanged following the MVC.
