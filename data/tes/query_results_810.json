Here, we tackle this issue by interfering with high frequency oscillations (80\u2013250 Hz) via external application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the human motor cortex (M1). Twenty-one subjects participated in three different experimental studies and they received on separate days tACS at three frequencies (80 Hz, 140 Hz and 250 Hz) and sham stimulation in a randomized order. tACS with 140 Hz frequency increased M1 excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation-generated motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during and for up to 1 h after stimulation. Control experiments with sham and 80 Hz stimulation were without any effect, and 250 Hz stimulation was less efficient with a delayed excitability induction and reduced duration. After-effects elicited by 140 Hz stimulation were robust against inversion of test MEP amplitudes seen normally under activation. Stimulation at 140 Hz reduced short interval intracortical inhibition, but left intracortical facilitation, long interval cortical inhibition and cortical silent period unchanged. Implicit motor learning was not facilitated by 140 Hz stimulation. High frequency stimulation in the ripple range is a new promising non-invasive brain stimulation protocol to increase human cortical excitability during and after the end of stimulation.", "pages": "879-86"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Null results in TMS: from absence of evidence to evidence of absence.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "19109497", "authors": ["de Graaf, TA", "Sack, AT"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews", "abstract": "In many important bioelectromagnetic problem settings, eddy-current simulations are required. Examples are the reduction of eddy-current artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging and techniques, whereby the eddy currents interact with the biological system, like the alteration of the neurophysiology due to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS has become an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. A widely applied method for simulating the eddy currents is the impedance method (IM). However, this method has to contend with an ill conditioned problem and consequently a long convergence time. When dealing with optimal design problems and sensitivity control, the convergence rate becomes even more crucial since the eddy-current solver needs to be evaluated in an iterative loop. Therefore, we introduce an independent IM (IIM), which improves the conditionality and speeds up the numerical convergence. This paper shows how IIM is based on IM and what are the advantages. Moreover, the method is applied to the efficient simulation of TMS. The proposed IIM achieves superior convergence properties with high time efficiency, compared to the traditional IM and is therefore a useful tool for accurate and fast TMS simulations.", "pages": "879-86"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Cognitive, mood, and electroencephalographic effects of noninvasive cortical stimulation with weak electrical currents.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "19012975", "authors": ["Tadini, L", "El-Nazer, R", "Brunoni, AR", "Williams, J", "Carvas, M", "Boggio, P", "Priori, A", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "Children undergoing corrective spine surgery are at risk of serious neurologic injury. Monitoring transcranial electric motor evoked potentials (TCeMEPs) during these procedures may identify and help prevent injury to motor pathways. The difficulty in obtaining consistent motor evoked potential (MEP) responses during pediatric spine surgery can result in part to the suppression of evoked responses caused by volatile inhalational anesthetics, elevated levels of propofol, and/or physiologic variables. Data obtained from 140 pediatric patients who underwent spine surgery with MEP monitoring were retrospectively analyzed and evaluated for age and anesthetic effects on stimulation variables. MEPs acquired under inhalational anesthetic agents required greater stimulation compared to intravenous propofol anesthesia. Additionally, the responses were more variable when inhalational agents were used. These effects were more prominent in younger age patients. The number of alerts of MEP loss or reduction related to anesthetic levels or blood pressure changes was higher under inhalational agents.", "pages": "879-86"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Introducing graph theory to track for neuroplastic alterations in the resting human brain: a transcranial direct current stimulation study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "19299613", "authors": ["Polan\u00eda, R", "Paulus, W", "Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a common form of focal dystonia.
