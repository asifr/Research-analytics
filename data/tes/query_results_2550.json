This study assessed whether such changes also altered the \"excitability\" of the motor cortex. Eleven subjects performed a series of voluntary conditioning contractions of the wrist flexors designed to remove slack in the intrafusal fibres (contract and test at intermediate length, termed \"contract-test\") or to introduce slack (contract at long length and test at intermediate length, termed \"contract-long\"). Surface electromyographic recordings were made from one wrist flexor, flexor carpi radialis. Subjects relaxed after each contraction, and 10 s later a test stimulus was applied to elicit a tendon tap response, H-reflex, or motor-evoked potential (MEP) to transcranial magnetic stimulation in the flexor carpi radialis. Each of the three test stimuli was applied during 15 consecutive pairs of contractions (\"contract-long\" and \"contract-test\"). Three subjects repeated the protocol using transmastoid electrical stimulation as the test stimulus to evoke a cervicomedullary motor-evoked potential (CMEP). For the group of subjects, after conditioning contractions designed to induce slack there was a significant reduction in the amplitude of the tendon reflex, no significant change in the H-reflex, and a small but significant reduction in the amplitude of the MEP. In one subject the CMEP was significantly reduced, while it was unchanged in two others. In the absence of corresponding changes in the H-reflex (or CMEP), changes in the size of the response to motor cortical stimulation suggest that the level of motor cortical \"excitability\" changes according to naturally induced variations in the discharge of muscle spindle afferents.", "pages": "731-7"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Fatigue-induced change in corticospinal drive to back muscles in elite rowers.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1386890", "authors": ["Fulton, RC", "Strutton, PH", "McGregor, AH", "Davey, NJ"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "abstract": "This study examined post-exercise changes in corticospinal excitability in five 'elite' rowers and six nonrowers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the motor cortex and bilateral electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made from erector spinae (ES) muscles at L3/L4 spinal level and from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the dominant hand. Each subject completed two exercise protocols on a rowing ergometer: a light exercise protocol at a sub-maximal output for 10 min and an intense exercise protocol at maximum output for 1 min. A trial of ten magnetic stimuli was delivered before each of the protocols and, on finishing exercise, further trials of ten stimuli were delivered every 2 min for a 16 min period. Amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in each of the three test muscles were measured before exercise and during the recovery period after exercise. The non-rowers showed a brief facilitation of MEPs in ES 2 min after light and intense exercise that was only present in the elite rowers after intense exercise. In the period 4-16 min after light exercise, the mean (+/- S.E.M.) MEP amplitude (relative to pre-exercise levels) was less depressed in the elite rowers (79.4 +/- 2.1%) than in the non-rowers (60.9 +/- 2.5%) in the left ES but not significantly so in the right ES. MEP amplitudes in FDI were significantly larger in the elite rowers, averaging 119.0 +/- 3.1% pre-exercise levels, compared with 101.2 +/- 5.8% in the non-rowers. Pre-exercise MEP latencies were no different in the two groups. After light exercise MEP latencies became longer in the elite rowers (left ES, 16.1 +/- 0.5 ms; right ES, 16.1 +/- 0.4 ms; dominant FDI, 23.4 +/- 0.2 ms) than in the non-rowers (left ES, 15.0 +/- 0.3 ms; right ES, 15.2 +/- 0.3 ms; dominant FDI, 21.5 +/- 0.2 ms). There were no differences in MEP depression or latency between elite rowers and non-rowers after intense exercise. We conclude that the smaller degree of MEP depression in the elite rowers after light exercise reflects less central fatigue within corticospinal control pathways than that seen in the non-rowers. The longer latency of MEPs seen in the elite rowers may reflect recruitment of more slower-conducting fatigue-resistant motor units compared with the non-rowers. These differences may be because the energy requirements for the non-rowers during light exercise are closer to their maximum capacity, leading to more fatigue. This notion is supported by the lack of any difference between groups following intense exercise when both groups were working at their own maximum.", "pages": "731-7"}, {"volume": "148", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation: new insights into representational cortical plasticity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "151631", "authors": ["Siebner, HR", "Rothwell, J"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Experimental brain research. Experimentelle Hirnforschung. Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "In the last decade, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used increasingly as a tool to explore the mechanisms and consequences of cortical plasticity in the intact human cortex. Because the spatial accuracy of the technique is limited, we refer to this as plasticity at a regional level. Currently, TMS is used to explore regional reorganization in three different ways. First, it can map changes in the pattern of connectivity within and between different cortical areas or their spinal projections. Important examples of this approach can be found in the work on motor cortex representations following a variety of interventions such as immobilization, skill acquisition, or stroke. Second, TMS can be used to investigate the behavioural relevance of these changes. By applying TMS in its \"virtual lesion\" mode, it is possible to interfere with cortical function and ask whether plastic reorganization within a distinct cortical area improves function. Third, TMS can be used to promote changes in cortical function. This is achieved by using repetitive TMS (rTMS) to induce short-term functional reorganization in the human cortex. The magnitude and the direction of rTMS-induced plasticity depend on extrinsic factors (i.e. the variables of stimulation such as intensity, frequency, and total number of stimuli) and intrinsic factors (i.e. the functional state of the cortex targeted by rTMS). Since conditioning effects of rTMS are not limited to the stimulated cortex but give rise to functional changes in interconnected cortical areas, rTMS is a suitable tool to investigate plasticity within a distributed functional network. Indeed, the lasting effects of rTMS offer new possibilities to study dynamic aspects of the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases and may have therapeutic potential in some neuropsychiatric disorders.", "pages": "731-7"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Current practice of motor evoked potential monitoring: results of a survey.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "8140258", "authors": ["Legatt, AD"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Centers responding to a survey of MEP monitoring practices predominantly used transcranial electrical brain stimulation (TCES) with brief pulse trains and/or spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to elicit MEPs; transcranial magnetic stimulation and single-pulse TCES were not techniques of choice.

Adverse effects included rare tongue injuries or seizures from TCES, and minor bleeding from needle electrodes in muscle. Spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle recording sites were all employed. TCES with recording of muscle responses was the preferred MEP monitoring technique at the plurality of the centers. MEPs suitable for monitoring were obtained in about 91.6% of patients overall. Most of the failures were attributed to technical factors; preexisting neurologic dysfunction precluded MEP monitoring in approximately 1.7% of patients. Almost all centers monitored SEPs concurrently with MEPs. Overall, both measures remained stable during about 90.2% of cases. Adverse MEP changes occurred in about 8.3%; a little over half of these were accompanied by SEP changes. Adverse SEP changes without MEP changes occurred in about 1.5% of cases.

Comparative analysis indicates that brain damage and kindling are highly unlikely. There have been remarkably few adverse events. Pulse train TES-induced or coincidental seizures (n = 5) are rare, probably because of very brief (<0.03 second) stimuli, anesthesia, and the general absence of predisposing cerebral conditions. Soft bite blocks may prevent tongue or lip laceration (n = 29) or mandibular fracture (n = 1). Rare cardiac arrhythmia (n = 5) and intraoperative awareness (n = 1) may be coincidental. Minor scalp burns (n = 2) are rare. Although possible, no spinal epidural recording electrode complications or injuries resulting from TES-induced movement were found. There have been no recognized adverse neuropsychological effects, headaches, or endocrine disturbances. Comprehensive relative contraindications include epilepsy, cortical lesions, convexity skull defects, raised intracranial pressure, cardiac disease, proconvulsant medications or anesthetics, intracranial electrodes, vascular clips or shunts, and cardiac pacemakers or other implanted biomedical devices. Otherwise unexplained intraoperative seizures and possibly arrhythmias are indications to abort TES.

MST is under investigation as a means of improving the safety profile of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Although both MST and ECT induce seizures through electrical stimulation of the brain, the electric field induced by MST is more focal and limited than that induced by ECT. Because magnetic fields pass through tissue unimpeded, there is greater control over the site and extent of stimulation with MST than can be achieved with ECT. This enhanced control represents a means of focusing the treatment on target cortical structures thought to be essential to antidepressant response and of reducing spread to medial temporal regions implicated in the cognitive side effects of ECT. MST is currently at an early stage of development. This article reviews the experience with MST in animal models and initial human investigations. Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility of performing MST in the clinical setting, and there are suggestions that MST may have advantages over ECT in terms of subjective side effects and some measures of acute cognitive functioning. The antidepressant efficacy of MST is not yet known, but studies designed to address that critical issue are underway. As with all attempts to refine convulsive therapy techniques (such as modifications in stimulation parameter configurations and electrode placement), the ultimate clinical value of MST will need to be established through controlled clinical trials.", "pages": "731-7"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Neurophysiological investigations in patients with primary writing tremor.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "133213", "authors": ["Modugno, N", "Nakamura, Y", "Bestmann, S", "Curra, A", "Berardelli, A", "Rothwell, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The pathophysiology of primary writing tremor (PWT) is still unknown: it has been classified as a focal form of essential tremor and as a tremulous form of writer's cramp.

We used electrical stimulation of median and radial nerve to study reciprocal inhibition of forearm antagonist muscles and paired transcranial magnetic stimulation at short and long interstimulus intervals (ISIs) to assess intracortical excitability. Both studies were conducted on patients with PWT and on control subjects. The early (presynaptic) and late (disynaptic) phases of reciprocal inhibition were normal as was intracortical excitability at short and long ISIs.

This omission is likely due to the current lack of data establishing a clear correlation between the electrophysiological results and those of clinical assessment. We address this issue in a cohort of 36 patients at relatively early stages of the disease (I and II). Electrophysiological studies comprised the recording of palmar sympathetic skin responses (SSRs), blink reflexes (BRs), thenar long latency reflexes (LLRs), cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and electromyographic silent periods evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (SPs). Results were analyzed with reference to disease duration and staging and to specific cognitive, psychiatric, and motor alteration. SEPs were the most and very sensitive markers, because they were abnormal in 94% of patients. Except for LLRs, alteration of electrophysiological results increased in parallel to the evolution of the disease. Except for LLRs and SSR latency, electrophysiological results correlated with those of specific clinical examinations. In particular, an increased BR latency or a reduced amplitude of the N20 component of SEPs correlated with the extent of bradykinesia, whereas a reduced amplitude of SSRs or of the N30 component of SEPs correlated with hyperkinesia. Overall, electrophysiological tests, in particular SEPs and BRs, appeared sensitive and interesting in the follow-up of HD patients and correlated with various clinical parameters, suggesting that these easy to perform and noninvasive repeatable examinations could be added fruitfully to the assessment programs for HD.", "pages": "731-7"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "New methods of minimally invasive brain modulation as therapies in psychiatry: TMS, MST, VNS and DBS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "7264981", "authors": ["George, MS"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed", "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, new methods have been developed that have allowed scientists to visualize the human brain in action.

Psychiatry is abandoning the pharmacological model of 'brain as soup', used for much of the past 20 years. Instead, there is new realization that both normal and abnormal behavior arise from chemical processes that occur within parallel distributed networks in specific brain regions. Many of these pathological circuits are becoming well characterized, in disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease, to obsessive-compulsive disorder, to depression. Most recently, there has been an explosion of new techniques that allow for direct stimulation of these brain circuits, without the need for open craniotomy and neurosurgical ablation. The techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This review will describe these new tools, and overview their current and future potential for research and clinical neuropsychiatric use.
