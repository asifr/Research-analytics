Motor evoked potentials (MEP) appear to have a high specificity but a rather low sensitivity with regard to motor recovery. The silent period (SP) has been proposed as an additional factor to the MEP for predicting motor recovery that might optimize the sensitivity of TMS. The authors reviewed the literature and case series focusing on the additional value of the SP to the MEP for predicting poststroke hand motor recovery. Studies that have analyzed the SP for predicting poststroke motor recovery have rather inconsistent results and suffer from heterogeneity in technical methods, methodology, and patient characteristics. In most studies, prolonged SPs have been found immediately after stroke, whereas in the (sub)acute phase thereafter, different patterns of SP duration have been found. These differences are thought to be related to stroke localization, though contraction-induced reduction phenomena and recovery-related intracortical phenomena may also be responsible. Although the SP might be used to identify clinically silent or minor strokes, in acute stroke patients with initial severe paresis or paralysis, the SP seems to have no additional value to MEP for predicting poststroke motor recovery. Nevertheless, the SP (poststroke-reduced SPs and contraction-induced inhibitory phenomena) has been proposed as a prognostic factor for poststroke spasticity. This review emphasizes the significance of the SP in predicting poststroke motor recovery and spasticity. Although the relation among the SP, recovery-related intracortical phenomena, and spasticity remains unclear, a neurophysiologic model underlying the SP is discussed. However, more research is needed on the value of the SP for predicting poststroke spasticity.", "pages": "10-24"}, {"volume": "163", "title": "Impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the parietal cortex on metabolic brain activity: a 14C-2DG tracing study in the cat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15688174", "authors": ["Valero-Cabr\u00e9, A", "Payne, BR", "Rushmore, J", "Lomber, SG", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We have used 14C-labeled deoxyglucose (14C-2DG) mapping during repetitive TMS (rTMS) of the posterior and inferior parietal cortex in anesthetized cats to study, with exquisite spatial resolution, the local and distant effects of rTMS on brain activity. High-frequency rTMS decreases metabolic activity at the primary site of stimulation with respect to homologue areas in the unstimulated hemisphere. In addition, rTMS induces specific distant effects on cortical and subcortical regions known to receive substantial efferent projections from the stimulated cortex. The magnitude of this distal impact is correlated with the strength of the anatomical projections. Thus, in the anesthetized animal, the impact of rTMS is upon a distributed network of structures connected to the primary site of application.", "pages": "10-24"}, {"volume": "161", "title": "[Motor cortex stimulation for Parkinson's disease and dystonia: lessons from transcranial magnetic stimulation?

Transcranial magnetic brain stimulation is useful for extraoperative evaluation of the motor system, but anesthetic effects on cortical synaptic activity limit its usefulness for intraoperative monitoring. Another proposed monitoring technique, rostral spinal cord stimulation with recording from peripheral nerves, predominantly reflects retrograde conduction within the dorsal columns; like SSEPs, this technique may fail to detect motor pathway damage. The true motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring technique preferred by most institutions involves transcranial electrical brain stimulation. This stimulates the corticospinal tract axons directly, producing a D-wave in them. There may be additional corticospinal tract volleys, reflecting indirect activation of the pyramidal cells via synapses from cortical interneurons; these I-waves are largely suppressed by anesthesia. Temporal summation at the alpha motor neuron synapse is necessary to elicit myogenic MEPs (M-waves) under anesthesia; this is accomplished with brief trains of stimuli that produce multiple pyramidal tract volleys. High stimulus intensities are required to stimulate the brain through an intact skull; with proper precautions, this is acceptably safe. Myogenic MEPs are quite sensitive to anesthesia and show considerable run-to-run variability. Therefore, criteria for evaluating MEPs differ from those for SSEPs, and the anesthetic regimen and degree of neuromuscular blockade must be carefully controlled. SSEPs should be monitored concurrently with MEPs, because the dorsal columns may be affected without compromise of the motor tracts, and also because this provides redundancy, with two independent assessments of spinal cord function.", "pages": "10-24"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Improvement of motor function with noninvasive cortical stimulation in a patient with chronic stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15673839", "authors": ["Hummel, F", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "Surgical correction of spinal deformities in children presents a challenge to the anaesthetist because of the extensive nature of the surgery, the co-morbidities of the patients and the constraints on anaesthetic techniques of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of the spinal cord.

Patients with scoliosis secondary to neuromuscular conditions are at greatest risk of perioperative problems, particularly excessive blood loss and respiratory failure. The risk of spinal cord damage can be decreased by the use of intraoperative spinal cord monitoring, particularly monitoring of the lower limb compound muscle action potential evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation. Specific anaesthetic techniques are required for this monitoring to be reliable.

In 12 patients undergoing craniotomy, stimulation patterns (300-500 V; 100-1000 Hz; 1-5 stimuli) were varied randomly at different PTPCs (2, 4, and 6 microg/mL). Remifentanil was administered unchanged at 0.2 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1). MEPs were recorded from the thenar and hypothenar muscles. Analysis of MEPs was blinded to the PTPC. Three-way analysis of variance revealed significant main effects of increasing stimulation intensity, frequency, and number of stimuli on MEP amplitude (P < 0.05). Maximum MEP amplitudes and recording success rates were observed with three or more stimuli delivered at 1000 Hz and > or =150 V. A significant main effect of PTPC (2 vs 4 and 6 microg/mL) on MEP amplitude was observed at the thenar recording site only (P < 0.05). An amplitude ratio calculated from corresponding MEPs evoked by double and quadruple stimulation proved to be insensitive to changes in PTPC.
