Since unrestricted neuroplastic modifications of network connectivity will result in a de-stabilization of the system, metaplastic modification rules have been proposed for keeping plastic connectivity changes within a useful dynamic range. In this connection, the modification threshold to achieve synaptic strengthening is thought to correlate negatively with the history of activity of the respective neurons, i.e. high previous activity enhances the threshold for synaptic strengthening and vice versa. However, the relevance of metaplasticity for actual learning processes has not been tested so far. We reduced or enhanced motor cortex excitability before performance of the serial reaction time task (SRTT), a sequential motor learning paradigm, and a reaction time task (RTT) by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). If homeostatic rules apply, excitability-diminishing cathodal tDCS should improve subsequent motor learning, especially if combined with the partial NMDA receptor-agonist d-cycloserine, which selectively enhances efficacy of active receptors, while excitability-enhancing anodal tDCS should reduce it. Only the results for anodal tDCS, when combined with d-cycloserine, were in accordance with the rules of homeostatic plasticity. We conclude that homeostatic plasticity, as tested here, has a limited influence on implicit sequential motor learning.", "pages": "1042"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Cortical evoked responses to magnetic stimulation of macaque's abdominal wall in sleep-wake cycle.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15582373", "authors": ["Pigarev, I", "Almirall, H", "Pigareva, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered over the posterior parietal cortex increases choice reaction times in visual search for a target defined by a conjunction of features.

Here we investigated the role of the posterior parietal cortex in visual search by applying TMS while subjects performed unspeeded feature and conjunction visual search tasks matched for level of difficulty. TMS over the right, but not the left angular gyrus (AG) in the parietal cortex, nor vertex decreased subjects' sensitivity on the conjunction but not the feature search task, as measured by the signal detection measure, d'.

They avoid surgical risks and provide theoretical advantages of specific neural circuit neuromodulation. Neuromodulatory effects depend on extrinsic stimulation factors (cortical target, frequency, intensity, duration, number of sessions), intrinsic patient factors (disease process, individual variability and symptoms, state of medication treatment), and outcome measures. Most studies to date have shown beneficial effects of rTMS or tDCS on clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and support the notion of spatial specificity to the effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms. Stimulation parameters have varied widely, however, and some studies are poorly controlled. Studies of rTMS or tDCS in dystonia have provided abundant data on physiology, but few on clinical effects. Multiple mechanisms likely contribute to the clinical effects of rTMS and tDCS in movement disorders, including normalization of cortical excitability, rebalancing of distributed neural network activity, and induction of dopamine release. It remains unclear how to individually adjust rTMS or tDCS factors for the most beneficial effects on symptoms of PD or dystonia. Nonetheless, the noninvasive nature, minimal side effects, positive effects in preliminary clinical studies, and increasing evidence for rational mechanisms make rTMS and tDCS attractive for ongoing investigation.", "pages": "1042"}, {"volume": "435", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interrupts phase synchronization during rhythmic motor entrainment.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15661100", "authors": ["Malcolm, MP", "Lavine, A", "Kenyon, G", "Massie, C", "Thaut, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "We studied the effect of levetiracetam (LEV), an anticonvulsant with a novel mechanism of action, on cortical excitability, measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
