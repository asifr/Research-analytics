Spine", "abstract": "Brief interruption of voluntary EMG in a hand muscle by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1), the so-called ipsilateral silent period (ISP), is a measure of interhemispheric motor inhibition. However, little is known about how volitional motor activity would modulate the ISP. Here we tested in 30 healthy adults to what extent and under what conditions voluntary activation of the stimulated right M1 by moving the left hand strengthens interhemispheric inhibition as indexed by an enhancement of the ISP area in the maximally contracting right first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Left index finger abduction, already at low levels of contraction, significantly enhanced the ISP compared to left hand at rest. Even imagination of left index finger movement enhanced the ISP compared to rest or mental calculation. This enhancement occurred in the absence of motor-evoked potential amplitude modulation in the left FDI, thus excluding a non-specific contribution from an increase in right M1 corticospinal excitability. Contraction of the left extensor indicis, but not contraction of more proximal left upper limb or left or right lower limb muscles also enhanced the ISP. A reaction time experiment showed that the ISP enhancement developed at a late stage of movement preparation just before or at movement onset. Interhemispheric inhibition of the motor-evoked potential as tested by a bifocal paired-pulse TMS protocol and thought to be mediated via a neuronal circuit different to the ISP was not enhanced when tested under identical motor task conditions. Finally, ISP enhancement by contraction of the left FDI correlated inversely with EMG mirror activity in the right FDI during phasic abductions of the left index finger. Our findings strongly suggest that voluntary M1 activation by real or imagined movement of the contralateral hand increases interhemispheric motor inhibition of the opposite M1. This phenomenon shows substantial topographical, temporal and neuronal circuit specificity, and has functional significance as it probably plays a pivotal role in suppressing mirror activity.", "pages": "3-46"}, {"volume": "587", "title": "Interactions between short-interval intracortical inhibition and short-latency afferent inhibition in human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 21", "pmid": "17556392", "authors": ["Alle, H", "Heidegger, T", "Kriv\u00e1nekov\u00e1, L", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with simultaneous high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) represents a straightforward way to gauge cortical excitability and connectivity in humans. However, the analysis, classification and interpretation of TMS-evoked potentials are hampered by scarce a priori knowledge about the physiological effect of TMS and by lack of an established data analysis framework. Here, we implemented a standardized, data-driven procedure to characterize the electrical response of the cerebral cortex to TMS by means of three synthetic indices: significant current density (SCD), phase-locking (PL) and significant current scattering (SCS). SCD sums up the amplitude of all significant currents induced by TMS, PL reflects the ability of TMS to reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations, while SCS measures the average distance of significantly activated sources from the site of stimulation. These indices are aimed at capturing different aspects of brain responsiveness, ranging from global cortical excitability towards global cortical connectivity. We analyzed the EEG responses to TMS of Brodmann's area 19 at increasing intensities in five healthy subjects. The spatial distribution and time course of SCD, PL and SCS revealed a reproducible profile of excitability and connectivity, characterized by a local activation threshold around a TMS-induced electric field of 50 V/m and by a selective propagation of TMS-evoked activation from occipital to ipsilateral frontal areas that reached a maximum at 70-100 ms. These general indices may be used to characterize the effects of TMS on any cortical area and to quantitatively evaluate cortical excitability and connectivity in physiological and pathological conditions.", "pages": "3-46"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "In-session seizures during low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with epilepsy.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17989279", "authors": ["Rotenberg, A", "Bae, EH", "Muller, PA", "Riviello, JJ", "Bourgeois, BF", "Blum, AS", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "Stretch reflexes and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of a muscle are facilitated when performing intensive contraction of muscles located in a different segment (remote effect). We investigated to what extent the remote effect on MEPs in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) in humans is modulated during sustained maximal and submaximal voluntary contractions of the ipsilateral quadriceps (remote muscle). We found that even when the force of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the remote muscle declined during sustained MVC, the magnitude of the remote effect on MEPs remained constant. Maximal electrical stimulation of the remote muscle and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the corresponding motor cortex revealed that the level of voluntary activation gradually decreased during the sustained MVC. The motor response in the FCR following magnetic stimulation at the level of the foramen magnum, which preferentially elicits muscle response as a direct response of the corticospinal tract, was not modified by the remote effect during the sustained MVC. This finding suggested that the excitability of the spinal motoneuron pool remained constant. In contrast to the sustained MVC, during sustained submaximal contraction of the remote muscle, the magnitude of the remote effect on MEPs gradually increased as muscle fatigue developed. These findings suggest that the remote effect on MEPs was dependent on the level of effort driving the remote muscle, but not on the actual level of force output of the remote muscle, and that the origin of the remote effect was supraspinal, putatively upstream of the primary motor cortex.", "pages": "3-46"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Pharmacology and treatment of neuropathic pains.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17999432", "authors": ["Jensen, TS", "Madsen, CS", "Finnerup, NB"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current opinion in neurology", "abstract": "Porcine spinal cords were mechanically injured at the thoracic level while recording muscle-derived electrically stimulated transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) and electromyography (EMG) readings from the same electrode derivations.
