Although it has been the gold standard for determining language dominance for more than four decades, its invasiveness has prompted a search for noninvasive alternatives. Potential replacements have included neuropsychological techniques, measurements of anatomic brain asymmetries, magnetic stimulation for deactivation of language cortex, measurement of the electrical or magnetic neurophysiologic response to language activation, and methods that detect the hemodynamic response to activation of language cortex, namely increased local blood flow or increased local oxygenation. Based on widespread availability and the ability to provide localizing as well as lateralizing information, functional MRI will likely be the most widely used alternative.", "pages": "483-90"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Therapeutic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Parkinson's disease: analysis of [11C] raclopride PET study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17999422", "authors": ["Kim, JY", "Chung, EJ", "Lee, WY", "Shin, HY", "Lee, GH", "Choe, YS", "Choi, Y", "Kim, BJ"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used as a potential therapeutic tool in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the therapeutic value and/or the placebo effect of rTMS on PD remain to be elucidated. To investigate the therapeutic value and/or placebo effect of rTMS in PD, we compared the motor section of unified PD rating scale (UPDRS III) and the amount of extracellular dopamine concentration using [(11)C] raclopride PET before and after two sessions of rTMS in 9 PD patients. During a consecutive 2 days while off-medication, two series of 15 trains of 5 Hz-frequency rTMS (intensity, 90% of the resting motor threshold) were applied to the hand area of more severely symptomatic motor cortex (MC). After unilateral rTMS of MC, mean raclopride binding potentials (BPs) were reduced not only in putaminal and caudate areas on the stimulated side (-4.9% and -6.5%, respectively) (P > 0.05) but also in putaminal and caudate areas of nonstimulated hemispheres (-6.6%, P > 0.05 and -12.1%, P = 0.049, respectively). UPDRS III scores were significantly decreased (35.0 +/- 14.1 to 32.0 +/- 13.4, P = 0.049).

Thus, many treatments, both medical and surgical, have been developed for this relapsing and remitting, paroxysmal stabbing or electrical, facial pain syndrome. The likely etiology in many cases is vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone, leading to focal demyelination and aberrant neural discharges. MRI may disclose neurovascular contact, although not with sufficient sensitivity or specificity to substitute for careful clinical diagnosis. In treating TN, antiepileptic drugs are superior to traditional analgesics. Carbamazepine is the first choice drug. Additional drugs for which there is evidence of efficacy include oxcarbazepine, baclofen, gabapentin, lamotrigine and phenytoin. Many patients eventually experience tachyphylaxis or may not tolerate effective doses. Surgical options include: microvascular decompression; balloon compression; radiofrequency thermocoagulation or glycerol rhizotomies; and subcutaneous alcohol branch blockade. Stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery is a further option. Motor cortex stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, although having shown initial promise for trigeminal neuropathic pain, seem to be ineffective for classical TN.

Area MT/MST was localized by the use of a TMS-induced misperception of visual motion, and its location was verified through the monitored completion of a motion discrimination task. We controlled for possible impairments in general visual processing by having subjects perform an object categorization task with and without TMS. Although MT/MST stimulation impaired performance in a motion discrimination task (and vertex stimulation did not), there was no difference in performance between the two forms of stimulation in the implied motion discrimination task. MT/MST stimulation did, however, improve subjects' performance in the object categorization task. These results indicate that, within 150 msec of stimulus presentation, MT/MST is not directly involved in the visual processing of static images in which motion is implied.

In polio survivors the slope of the recruitment curve was normal, but maximal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were larger than in controls. MEPs were depressed after fatiguing exercise. Three patients with central fatigue by twitch interpolation had a trend toward slower recovery. There was no association with symptoms of post-polio syndrome.

Here, we test the evolution of skill learning-dependent changes in motor plasticity and excitability in six subjects trained to perform rapid thumb abductions over 5 d. Plasticity was examined using paired-associative stimulation (PAS) of the median nerve and motor cortex to induce LTP-like \"PAS given with an interstimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25)\" or long-term depression (LTD)-like \"PAS given with an interstimulus interval of 10 ms (PAS10)\" plasticity. Excitability was tested by measuring recruitment of motor-evoked-potentials \"input-output (IO) curve\" and of short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI curve), and sensorimotor organization (SMO). Task performance improved continuously over 5 d. After practice on day 1, the PAS25 effect reversed from facilitation to inhibition whereas the slope of the IO curve increased and the level of SICI decreased. These effects on IO curve and SICI were still present or even enhanced before the last practice on day 5, and were not changed by it. The effect of proprioceptive input from the trained muscle on SMO was also strengthened before practice on day 5. In contrast, PAS-induced plasticity was not influenced by motor practice on day 5, and had returned to prepractice values. The interference with PAS-induced plasticity suggests that the initial performance improvement relies on increasing the efficacy of existing synaptic connections. However, the long-lasting changes in the IO curve, SICI curve, and SMO suggest that continued practice enhances performance by changing Motor cortical organization. We hypothesize that new synaptic connections might have formed that allow LTP/LTD-susceptibility to be restored without reducing synaptic strength and performance skill.", "pages": "483-90"}, {"volume": "185", "title": "Contralesional paired associative stimulation increases paretic lower limb motor excitability post-stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "17973101", "authors": ["Jayaram, G", "Stinear, JW"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Down-regulating motor excitability of the contralesional M1 using inhibitory neuromodulatory protocols has demonstrated a correlation between balanced interhemispheric interactions and increased motor recovery. In 2005, our laboratory first reported bidirectional modulation of healthy subjects' tibialis anterior (TA) motor excitability during walking, using a stimulation paradigm known as paired associative stimulation (PAS). Suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the lower limb M1 paired with electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve produced a persistent modulation of TA corticomotor excitability. The present study tested the hypothesis that the excitability of the ipsilesional lower limb motor cortex during walking is increased when inhibitory PAS is applied to the contralesional motor cortex in chronic stroke survivors. We applied inhibitory PAS (120 pairs at 0.5 Hz) to the quiescent paretic TA of ten chronic stroke patients and the right TA of ten age-matched healthy subjects. Post intervention excitability measures were taken immediately following PAS, and again 5, 10 and 15 min later. When inhibitory PAS was applied to the non-paretic TA of chronic stroke subjects, the non-paretic TA motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude decreased to 91% and paretic TA MEP amplitude increased to 130% (of pre-PAS values) during post-PAS walking. In healthy subjects, MEPs in response to TMS revealed that mean MEP amplitude from the stimulated TA decreased to 87% and the mean MEP amplitude from the non-stimulated TA increased to 126%. This is the first study to demonstrate that inhibitory PAS applied to the contralesional lower limb motor system of stroke survivors increases motor excitability of the paretic lower limb assessed during walking. This finding suggests that inhibitory PAS may be a useful tool to study how the human lower limb motor cortex recovers after neural injury, and that PAS may be a candidate adjuvant therapy for patients with neurological walking impairments.", "pages": "483-90"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Towards unravelling task-related modulations of neuroplastic changes induced in the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "17970738", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Terney, D", "Poreisz, C", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Stimulation with weak electrical direct currents has been shown to be capable of inducing stimulation-polarity-dependent prolonged diminutions or elevations of cortical excitability, most probably elicited by a hyper- or depolarization of resting membrane potentials.
