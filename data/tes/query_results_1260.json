Subjects were asked to observe on a computer monitor different pictures representing manipulations of different kind of tools. They had to produce a movement (go condition) or to keep the resting position (no-go condition) at the appearance of different cue signals represented by different colors shown alternatively on the hands manipulating the tools or on the picture background. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected at the offset of the visual stimuli before and after a 10 minute, 1 Hz rTMS train applied to the dorsolateral PFC (Experiment 1), to the PMC (Experiment 2) or to the primary motor cortex (Experiment 3). Following rTMS to the PFC, MEPs increased in the go condition when the cue for the go command was presented on the hand. In contrast, following rTMS to the PMC, in the same condition, MEPs were decreased. rTMS to the primary motor cortex did not produce any modulation. Results are discussed according to the presence of a visual-motor matching system in the PMC and to the role of the PFC in the attention-related processes. We hypothesize that the perceptual analysis for action selection within the PFC was modulated by rTMS and its temporary functional inactivation in turn influenced the premotor areas for motor programming.", "pages": "289-302"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Activation of motor pathways during observation and execution of hand movements.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "18979381", "authors": ["Borroni, P", "Baldissera, F"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Social neuroscience", "abstract": "Some neural properties of \"motor resonance\"--the subliminal activation of the motor system when observing actions performed by others--are investigated in humans. Two actions performed with the right hand are observed by experimental subjects: a finalized (transitive) action (reaching for and grasping a ball) and an intransitive action (cyclic up-and-down oscillation of the hand), while the H-reflex and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation techniques are utilized to test the excitability of the observer's motor pathways to hand and forearm muscles (first dorsal interosseus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor carpi radialis). Results indicate that motor resonance: (1) is mainly mediated by the primary motor cortex; (2) involves the same forearm muscles as used in the execution of the observed movement; (3) is also recorded in the homologous muscles of the arm contralateral to the one observed; and (4) is evoked by both transitive and intransitive movements of the human hand, but not by similar movements of inanimate objects. The similarities and discrepancies between the resonant response in humans and the properties of monkey \"mirror neurons\" are discussed.", "pages": "289-302"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Re.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of anodal tDCS on recognition memory, working memory and selective attention in Alzheimer disease (AD). Ten patients with diagnosis of AD received three sessions of anodal tDCS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left temporal cortex and sham stimulation) with an intensity of 2 mA for 30 min. Sessions were performed in different days in a randomised order. The following tests were assessed during stimulation: Stroop, Digit Span and a Visual Recognition Memory task (VRM). The results showed a significant effect of stimulation condition on VRM (p = 0.0085), and post hoc analysis showed an improvement after temporal (p = 0.01) and prefrontal (p = 0.01) tDCS as compared with sham stimulation. There were no significant changes in attention as indexed by Stroop task performance. As far as is known, this is the first trial showing that tDCS can enhance a component of recognition memory. The potential mechanisms of action and the implications of these results are discussed.", "pages": "289-302"}, {"volume": "80", "title": "Temporal cortex direct current stimulation enhances performance on a visual recognition memory task in Alzheimer disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "18449044", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Khoury, LP", "Martins, DC", "Martins, OE", "de Macedo, EC", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model.", "pages": "289-302"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "18977813", "authors": ["Rotenberg, A", "Muller, P", "Birnbaum, D", "Harrington, M", "Riviello, JJ", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Jensen, FE"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10mg/kg).
