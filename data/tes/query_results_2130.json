In the first part of this study we show that the masking effect of TMS differs to masking by light in terms of the psychometric function. Here we investigate the emergence of phosphenes in relation to perimetric measurements. The coil positions were measured with a stereotactic positioning device, and stimulation sites were characterized in four subjects on the basis of individual retinotopic maps measured by with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Phosphene thresholds were found to lie a factor of 0.59 below the stimulation intensities required to induce visual masking. They covered the segments in the visual field where visual suppression occurred with higher stimulation intensity. Both phosphenes and transient scotomas were found in the lower visual field in the quadrant contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere. They could be evoked from a large area over the occipital pole. Phosphene contours and texture remained quite stable with different coil positions over one hemisphere and did not change with the retinotopy of the different visual areas on which the coil was focused. They cannot be related exclusively to a certain functionally defined visual area. It is most likely that both the optic radiation close to its termination in the dorsal parts of V1 and back-projecting fibers from V2 and V3 back to V1 generate phosphenes and scotomas.", "pages": "129-40"}, {"volume": "160", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the visual system.

Both the underlying mechanisms and the brain structures involved are still unclear. The first part of the study characterizes the suppressive effect of TMS by psychophysical methods. Luminance increment thresholds for orientation discrimination were determined in four subjects using an adaptive staircase procedure. Coil position was controlled with a stereotactic positioning device. Threshold values were modulated by TMS, reaching a maximum effect at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of approx. 100 ms after visual target presentation. Stronger TMS pulses increased the maximum threshold while decreasing the SOA producing the maximum effect. Slopes of the psychometric function were flattened with TMS masking by a factor of 2, compared to control experiments in the absence of TMS. No change in steepness was observed in experiments using a light flash as the mask instead of TMS. Together with the finding that at higher TMS intensities, threshold elevation occurs even with shorter SOAs, this suggests lasting inhibitory processes as masking mechanisms, contradicting the assumption that the phosphene as excitatory equivalent causes masking. In the companion contribution to this one we present perimetric measurements and phosphene forms as a function of the stimulation site in the brain and discuss the putative generator structures.", "pages": "129-40"}, {"volume": "158", "title": "The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is essential in time reproduction: an investigation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15365666", "authors": ["Jones, CR", "Rosenkranz, K", "Rothwell, JC", "Jahanshahi, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The results were compared with rTMS over the leg area of motor cortex, an area not thought to be involved with time estimation. rTMS was delivered during one of two phases of a time reproduction task: at the onset of the Estimation Phase (presentation of the interval to be timed) and at the onset of the Reproduction Phase (subjects' reproduction of the timed interval). There was a significant main effect of Site (SMA vs. right DLPFC vs. leg motor area) due to the fact that rTMS over the right DLPFC caused subjects to underestimate time intervals compared with rTMS over the leg motor area. There was also a significant three-way interaction between Site, Duration and Phase (Estimation Phase vs. Reproduction Phase) that post hoc analyses showed was due to underestimation of long intervals when rTMS was given over the right DLPFC at the start of the Reproduction Phase. There was no effect of rTMS over the right DLPFC or SMA in the short interval task. This is consistent with previous studies showing that the right DLPFC is important in estimating time intervals in the seconds-range. In addition, we suggest that the selectivity of the rTMS effect for the Reproduction Phase indicates that the right DLPFC plays a particular role in memory processes.", "pages": "129-40"}, {"volume": "561", "title": "The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation on corticomuscular coherence in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "15358809", "authors": ["Hansen, NL", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Cortex and muscle show coupled oscillations in the 15-35 Hz frequency band during voluntary movements. To obtain evidence of the neuronal network responsible for this rhythmicity we investigated the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation on the coupling between eletcroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded from the scalp over the motor cortex and electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in 15 healthy human subjects. TMS over the leg area at intensities between 0.95 and 1.1 x threshold for a motor evoked potential (MEP) in the TA increased corticomuscular coherence in the 15-35 Hz frequency band. This effect lasted on average for 300 ms, but could last up to 600-800 ms in some subjects. Stimulation of motor nerves from the ankle muscles suppressed corticomuscular coherence in the 15-35 Hz frequency range between leg area EEG and TA EMG for a period up to 600-800 ms. In addition, increased coherence around 10 Hz was observed for a period up to 250 ms after the stimulation. Stimulation of motor nerves in the arm and motor nerves from the ankle muscles in the other leg had no effect. The findings indicate that TMS has direct access to the neuronal circuitry in the motor cortex, which generates the corticomuscular coherence. This effect was caused either by direct activation of corticospinal cells or by activation of local neuronal circuitries in the motor cortex. The effects of peripheral nerve stimulation suggest that an alternative rhythm generator may entrain the cortical cells into a lower 10 Hz rhythm and disrupt the 15-35 Hz rhythm.", "pages": "129-40"}, {"volume": "67", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with transient ischemic attacks.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1608977", "authors": ["Wong, WJ", "Chen, JT", "Kao, CD", "Shan, DE", "Lin, YY", "Hu, HH", "Wu, ZA", "Liao, KK"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA", "abstract": "By definition, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) do not leave a neurological deficit beyond 24 hours after onset.

It remains unclear, however, (i) which scalp sites are most appropriate to achieve the desired effects and (ii) which experimental setups produce facilitation or inhibition of language functions. We assessed the effects of TMS at different stimulation sites on picture-word verification in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers with left language lateralization, as determined by functional transcranial Dopplersonography, performed picture-word verification prior to and after rTMS (1 Hz for 600 s at 110% of subjects' resting motor thresholds). Stimulation sites were the classical language areas (Broca's and Wernicke's), their homolog brain regions of the right hemisphere, and the occipital cortex. Additionally, sham stimulation over Broca's area was applied in a subsample of 11 subjects. As a control task, 10 volunteers performed a colour-tone matching task under the same experimental conditions. There was a general nonspecific arousal effect for both verum and sham TMS for both the picture-word verification and for the control task. However, superimposed there were opposite effects on picture-word verification for stimulation of Wernicke's area and Broca's area, namely a relative inhibition in the case of Wernicke's area and a relative facilitation in the case of Broca's area. These results demonstrate that low frequency rTMS has both general arousing effects and domain-specific effects.", "pages": "129-40"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "Characterising the central mechanisms of sensory modulation in human swallowing motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "7623293", "authors": ["Gow, D", "Hobson, AR", "Furlong, P", "Hamdy, S"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "When associating hand and foot voluntary oscillations, isodirectional coupling is preferred irrespective of hand position (prone or supine). To investigate the neural correlates of this coupling modality, excitability of the motor projections innervating the resting forearm was tested during cyclic voluntary flexion-extensions of the ipsilateral foot. H-reflexes, in some experiments facilitated by subliminal Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), and Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CMAPs), evoked by supraliminal TMS, were elicited in Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) and Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR) muscles at five intervals during the foot movement cycle. With the hand prone, a sinusoidal excitability modulation was observed in wrist flexors and extensors, but reversed in phase: in FCR, excitability increased during plantar-flexion and decreased during dorsiflexion, while in ECR the opposite occurred. This reciprocal organisation was confirmed by the excitability modulation of CMAPs evoked simultaneously in the two antagonists. When the hand was supinated, the H-reflex modulation reversed in phase, i.e., FCR excitability increased during foot dorsiflexion and decreased during plantar-flexion. In both muscles and hand positions tested, when the muscle-to-movement phase-lag was increased by inertial loading of the foot, H-reflex excitability modulations remained phase linked to muscular contractions, not to movement. Together, these results suggest that the subliminal excitability modulation of hand movers has a common central origin with the parallel overt activation of foot movers, is reciprocally organised, and is direction- not muscle-dependent. It may therefore represent the neural substrate for isodirectional coupling of hand (prone or supine) with the foot.", "pages": "129-40"}]
