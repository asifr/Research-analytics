Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Conference", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method for treating various neurological and psychiatric disorders. With the growing demands of neuropathic pain patients and their increasing numbers, rTMS treatment tools are becoming more necessary. rTMS uses electromagnetic induction to induce weak electric currents by rapidly changing the magnetic field. Targeting the electric current to a specific part of the brain is one treatment for pain relief. This paper focuses on treatment for neuropathic pain caused by a lesion or disease of the central or peripheral nervous system, including stroke, trauma, or surgery. However, the current style of rTMS treatment is still developing and is so technically specialized that only a limited number of hospitals and only a handful of specialists can provide this therapy. The existing rTMS systems use an optical markerbased 3D sensing technique that positions the stimulation coil to target the small region of interest in the brain through coregistration with pre-scanned MRI data. This system requires the patient to be immobilized on a bed. The optical markers for 3D sensing are placed on the patient's head to maintain accurate positioning. We propose a constraints-free, markerless rTMS system, which employs ego-motion, a computation technique to estimate relative 3D motion of a camera to what the camera sees. We use a ToF sensor as a camera, which is capble of capturing shape information from a single viewpoint instantly. The markerless target spot is based on the shape features of the patient's face. This paper shows the process of a prototype system and its potential for achieving an easy-to-handle system framework.", "pages": "6163-6"}, {"volume": "2013", "title": "Anatomical variability predicts individual differences in transcranial electric stimulation motor threshold.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24109812", "authors": ["Lee, WH", "Lisanby, SH", "Laine, AF", "Peterchev, AV"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "We have proposed that the current amplitude in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) be lowered to produce stimulation closer to the neural activation threshold and individualized to account for anatomical variability across patients. A novel approach to individualize the ECT current amplitude could be via motor threshold (MT) determination with transcranial electric stimulation (TES) applied through the ECT electrodes instead of the fixed high current approach. This study derives an estimate of the electric field (E-field) neural activation threshold and tests whether individual differences in TES MT are explained by anatomical variability measurements and simulations in individual head models. The E-field distribution induced by a right unilateral (RUL) ECT electrode configuration was computed in subject-specific finite element head models of four nonhuman primates (NHPs) for whom MT was measured. By combining the measured MTs and the computed E-field maps, the neural activation threshold is estimated to be 0.45 \u00b1 0.07 V/cm for 0.2 ms stimulus pulse width. The individual MT was correlated with the electrode-to-cortex distance under the superior electrode (R(2)=.96, p=.022) as well as with the simulated electrode-current/induced-E-field ratio (R(2)=.95, p=.026), indicating that both anatomical measurements and computational models could predict the individual current requirements for transcranial stimulation. These findings could be used with realistic human head models and in clinical studies to explore novel ECT dosing paradigms, and as a new noninvasive means to determine individual dosage requirement with ECT.", "pages": "6163-6"}, {"volume": "2013", "title": "Calculating the induced electromagnetic fields in real human head by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24109807", "authors": ["Lu, M", "Ueno, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

It was found that double cone and H-coils have significantly deep field penetration at the expense of induced higher and wider spread electrical fields in superficial cortical regions.

Recently, optimized electrode geometries have been shown to increase the efficiency of neural stimulation by maximizing the variation of current density on the electrode surface. In the present work, a new family of modified fractal electrode geometries is developed to increase the neural activation function and enhance the efficiency of neural stimulation. It is hypothesized that the key factor in increasing the activation function in the tissue adjacent to the electrode is to increase the \"edginess\" of the electrode surface, a concept that is explained and quantified by fractal mathematics. Rigorous finite element simulations were performed to compute the distribution of electric potential produced by proposed geometries, demonstrating that the neural activation function was significantly enhanced in the tissue. The activation of 800 model axons positioned around the electrodes was also quantified, showing that modified fractal geometries yielded a 22% reduction in input power consumption while maintaining the same level of neural activation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of increasing stimulation efficiency using modified fractal geometries beyond the levels already reported in the literature.", "pages": "6163-6"}, {"volume": "2013", "title": "Computational model of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24109668", "authors": ["Parazzini, M", "Rossi, E", "Ferrucci, R", "Fiocchi, S", "Liorni, I", "Priori, A", "Ravazzani, P"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and high-density electroencephalography require accurate models of current flow for precise targeting and current source reconstruction. At a minimum, such modeling must capture the idiosyncratic anatomy of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and skull for each individual subject. Currently, the process to build such high-resolution individualized models from structural magnetic resonance images requires labor-intensive manual segmentation, even when utilizing available automated segmentation tools. Also, accurate placement of many high-density electrodes on an individual scalp is a tedious procedure. The goal was to develop fully automated techniques to reduce the manual effort in such a modeling process. Approach. A fully automated segmentation technique based on Statical Parametric Mapping 8, including an improved tissue probability map and an automated correction routine for segmentation errors, was developed, along with an automated electrode placement tool for high-density arrays. The performance of these automated routines was evaluated against results from manual segmentation on four healthy subjects and seven stroke patients. The criteria include segmentation accuracy, the difference of current flow distributions in resulting HD-tDCS models and the optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets.Main results. The segmentation tool can segment out not just the brain but also provide accurate results for CSF, skull and other soft tissues with a field of view extending to the neck. Compared to manual results, automated segmentation deviates by only 7% and 18% for normal and stroke subjects, respectively. The predicted electric fields in the brain deviate by 12% and 29% respectively, which is well within the variability observed for various modeling choices. Finally, optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets do not differ significantly.Significance. Fully automated individualized modeling may now be feasible for large-sample EEG research studies and tDCS clinical trials.", "pages": "6163-6"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Optimal parameters of transcranial electrical stimulation for intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials of the tibialis anterior muscle during pediatric scoliosis surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "24094910", "authors": ["Azabou, E", "Manel, V", "Andre-obadia, N", "Fischer, C", "Mauguiere, F", "Peiffer, C", "Lofaso, F", "Shils, JL"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial electric stimulation elicited muscle motor evoked potentials (TESmMEPs) is one of the best methods for corticospinal tract's function monitoring during spine and spinal cord surgeries.
