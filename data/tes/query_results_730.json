The particular type of surgery and the neurologic structures at risk determine the type of monitoring chosen. Although many methods are the same in adult and pediatric patients, some differences in the pediatric population will be discussed here. In general, monitoring consists of two types. The first involves monitoring data which is obtained on an ongoing basis, with comparisons to data obtained at the outset of surgery (baseline). The second form of monitoring involves mapping neural structures, so that a neural structure in the field is identified accurately, to avoid injuring it, or to demonstrate its degree of neurophysiologic function or impairment. In this paper we discuss both forms of monitoring and their general applications, including unique features or modifications needed in the pediatric population.", "pages": "161-70"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Interhemispheric enhancement of somatosensory cortical excitability through contralateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "21306944", "authors": ["Meehan, SK", "Linsdell, MA", "Handy, TC", "Boyd, LA"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were used to index somatosensory-somatosensory interhemispheric interactions and highlight potential mechanisms by which TMS alters contralateral somatosensory cortex excitability.", "pages": "161-70"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Cortical stimulation as an adjuvant to upper limb rehabilitation after stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12 Suppl 2", "pmid": "21172688", "authors": ["Harvey, RL", "Stinear, JW"], "year": "2010", "journal": "PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation", "abstract": "Fifteen healthy individuals participated in three sessions on separate days.

New insights into the role of activity-dependent motor recovery have guided clinicians to develop novel task-oriented therapies that are effective in reducing functional limitations in hand use after stroke. A number of brain-stimulation techniques have been examined as therapeutic adjuvants applied to enhance functional outcomes. Cortical stimulation with the use of either noninvasive techniques or implanted technology has shown some promise as an adjuvant therapy but has yet to be supported in well-designed clinical trials. In this article, we review the physiology of neural plasticity and of cortical stimulation. Laboratory studies and early clinical trials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and epidural cortical stimulation are reported. Cortical stimulation may have a role in facilitating motor recovery after stroke, but a better understanding of the physics of cortical stimulation, biological response to stimulation, effective stimulation protocols, and proper patient selection is needed.", "pages": "161-70"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Evaluation of combined use of transcranial and direct cortical motor evoked potential monitoring during unruptured aneurysm surgery.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "21281699", "authors": ["Motoyama, Y", "Kawaguchi, M", "Yamada, S", "Nakagawa, I", "Nishimura, F", "Hironaka, Y", "Park, YS", "Hayashi, H", "Abe, R", "Nakase, H"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "abstract": "The treatment of aphasias-acquired language disorders-caused by stroke and other neurological conditions has benefitted from insights from neuroscience and neuropsychology. Hebbian mechanisms suggest that massed practice and exploitation of residual neurological capacities can aid neurorehabilitation of patients with poststroke aphasia, and progress in basic neuroscience research indicates that the language system of the human brain is functionally interwoven with perceptual and motor systems. Intensive speech and language therapies, including constraint-induced aphasia therapy, that activate both the linguistic and concordant motor circuits utilize the knowledge gained from these advances in neuroscience research and can lead to surprisingly rapid improvements in language performance, even in patients with chronic aphasia. Drug-based therapies alone and in conjunction with behavioral language therapies also increase language performance in patients with aphasia. Furthermore, noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation techniques that target neuronal activity within perilesional areas might help patients with aphasia to regain lost language functions. Intensive language-action therapies that lead to rapid improvements in language skills might provide a new opportunity for investigating fast plastic neuronal changes in the areas of the brain associated with language processing.
