Functional imaging studies can reveal the consequences of the dopaminergic lesion in PD among a widespread network of subcortical-cortical regions. Characteristic patterns of normal cortical brain activation for motor tasks are systematically altered in PD. Recent work has emphasized the task dependence of these changes and their gradual evolution over the course of the disease. Clinically relevant PD treatment with medications or DBS tends to normalize these patterns. In this context, rTMS is discussed as a potential noninvasive alternative for neuromodulation of cortical function. Although rTMS is not a current treatment, we review recent rTMS studies in PD that suggest its promise, illustrate how functional imaging can guide application of rTMS, and suggest that subcortical dopamine release could be an rTMS mechanism of action. The combination of rTMS and functional neuroimaging broadens our knowledge of functional cortical networks in PD, which can eventually provide physicians with pathophysiologic information about different PD treatment options and rationales for neuromodulatory interventions.", "pages": "1-9"}, {"volume": "420", "title": "Short-interval intracortical inhibition is modulated by high-frequency peripheral mixed nerve stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17512117", "authors": ["Murakami, T", "Sakuma, K", "Nomura, T", "Nakashima, K"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Cortical excitability can be modulated by manipulation of afferent input.

The MEP amplitude and SICI of the APB muscle decreased transiently 0-10 min after the intervention, whereas the ICF did not change. High-frequency peripheral mixed nerve stimulation reduced the excitability of the motor cortex. The decrement in the SICI, which reflects the function of GABA(A)ergic inhibitory interneurons, might compensate for the reduced motor cortical excitability after high-frequency peripheral mixed nerve stimulation.", "pages": "1-9"}, {"volume": "254", "title": "Cutaneous silent periods in the evaluation of cord compression in cervical spondylosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17508136", "authors": ["Lo, YL", "Tan, YE", "Dan, YF", "Leoh, TH", "Tan, SB", "Tan, CT", "Chan, LL"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) may be challenging in patients with cervical spondylosis (CS).

Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess motor cortex function, we examined the physiological basis of these movements across three novel experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that upper limb corticomotor excitability changed in a way that facilitated isodirectional movements of the hand and foot, during phasic and isometric muscle activation conditions. Experiment 2 demonstrated that motor cortex inhibition was modified with active, but not passive, foot movement in a manner that facilitated hand movement in the direction of foot movement. Together, these findings demonstrate that the coupling between motor representations within motor cortex is activity dependent. Because there are no known connections between hand and foot areas within primary motor cortex, experiment 3 used a dual-coil paired-pulse TMS protocol to examine functional connectivity between secondary and primary motor areas during active ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and supplementary motor area (SMA) conditioning, but not ventral premotor cortex (PMv) conditioning, produced distinct phases of task-dependent modulation of excitability of forearm representations within primary motor cortex (M1). Networks involving PMd-M1 facilitate isodirectional movements of hand and foot, whereas networks involving SMA-M1 facilitate corticomotor pathways nonspecifically, which may help to stabilize posture during interlimb coordination. These results may have implications for targeted neurorehabilitation after stroke.", "pages": "1-9"}, {"volume": "181", "title": "Factors influencing the magnitude and reproducibility of corticomotor excitability changes induced by paired associative stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "17487476", "authors": ["Sale, MV", "Ridding, MC", "Nordstrom, MA"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
