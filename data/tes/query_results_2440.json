Depression is considered treatment-resistant when at least two adequate monotherapy trials with drugs from different pharmacologic classes fail to elicit a therapeutic response. Although determining the stage of TRD may allow concise description of a patient's antidepressant history, management of TRD is better served by recent attempts to create a treatment algorithm that encompasses definitive diagnosis of true TRD and strategies for optimizing available therapies, including consideration of novel treatment options. Present strategies for managing TRD include optimization of the initial drug, substitution of another drug from the same or a different antidepressant class, combination of two antidepressants with different mechanisms of action, and adding an antidepressant drug from another class. Potential nonpharmacologic treatments include vagus nerve stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and magnetic seizure therapy as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy. Several neuropeptides and their receptors have also been identified as potential targets for pharmacologic intervention, including corticotropin-releasing factor and substance P. Other treatments currently under investigation include augmentation of antidepressant therapy with an atypical antipsychotic agent such as olanzapine or risperidone.

Thirty healthy adults (male: 12, female: 18) were tested with TMS. Cutaneous pain was induced by topical application of capsaicin cream (0.025%) on the skin overlying the flexor carpi radialis of dominant limb. And the cream had been under an occlusive dressing for 40 minutes until we removed it. Magnetic stimulation was performed to the contralateral cortex with a circular coil at 80% intensity of maximum stimulator output. MEPs were recorded at flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and opponens pollicis (OP) with constant isometric contraction of 10%, 30% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC).

Values at baseline and 20, 40, 60, 80 minutes from applying capsaicin were compared. VAS score reached the peak value at 40 minutes. Amplitudes of MEPs at FCR progressively decreased up to 40 minutes than returned to nearly baseline value at 80 minutes. The decrease in MEP amplitude at FCR was accompanied by the increase in VAS score significantly and sustained for 20 min after washing out capsaicin cream. At ECR & OP, we could not demonstrate any changes in amplitude with time. Silent period at FCR only was significantly prolonged with the increase in VAS score.

To this end, we investigated the relationship between various stimulus intensities applied via transcranial magnetic stimulation and the size of motor-evoked potentials in 14 healthy subjects during voluntary plantarflexion and dorsiflexion (active lengthening) with a similar background activity (BGA) level. The shape of this relationship was sigmoidal and was characterized by a plateau value, maximum slope and threshold. The plateau value was clearly lower during LEN contractions than during SHO contractions. Likewise, the maximum slope was lower during LEN contractions. However, the threshold did not differ significantly between the two tasks. Since the plateau value and the maximum slope clearly differed between LEN and SHO contractions despite the similarity of their BGA levels, the central nervous system appears to have a different activation strategy for each of these tasks. Namely, the relative balance between excitatory and inhibitory components of the corticospinal volleys, as well as the subliminal fringe of the corticospinal pathway, were reduced during LEN contractions compared with SHO contractions. These strategies may help to avoid reflexive contractions brought about by higher discharge of muscle spindles and enable fine motor actions in voluntary lengthening contractions.", "pages": "1217-25"}, {"volume": "551", "title": "Failure of activation of spinal motoneurones after muscle fatigue in healthy subjects studied by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "12824449", "authors": ["Andersen, B", "Westlund, B", "Krarup, C"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "The purpose of this experiment was to determine the stimulating and recording characters of fascicular physioelectrical signals in the activity of peripheral nerves by longitudinally implanted intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) in a rabbit sciatic nerve model, and discuss the future application of LIFEs in functional electrical stimulation (FES) and control of electric arm prosthesis. In methodology, LIFEs were inserted into the fasciculus of the sciatic nerves of rabbits and used as recording electrodes and stimulating electrodes, respectively. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials (CSEPs), and electromyography (EMG) were recorded by using a transcranial stimulation system (TCS). LIFEs were found to have stable stimulating and recording characters. The interpeak amplitudes (IPAs) of MEPs ranged from 78-156 microV (mean +/- SD, 102 +/- 23.2 microV). The onset latency (OL) of MEPs ranged from 9.8-11.2 msec (mean +/- SD, 10.8 +/- 0.6 msec). The interpeak amplitudes (IPAs) of CSEPs ranged from 5.8-7.2 microV (mean +/- SD, 6.7 +/- 0.5 microV). The onset latency (OL) of CSEPs ranged from 11.4-14.6 msec (mean +/- SD, 12.8 +/- 1.3 msec). EMGs could be recorded in the gastrocnemius, but could not be recorded in the tibialis anterior muscle.

The aim of this study was to explore how rTMS changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. Using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left M1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. In particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 Hz rTMS. Analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of M1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. Conversely, after rTMS our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left M1 and anterior motor areas. These results are important for three reasons. First, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). Second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rTMS, similar to that seen in stroke patients. Third, changes in motor activations at the site of rTMS suggest an rTMS-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. This remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke.", "pages": "1217-25"}]
