The H reflex recorded in the forearm flexor muscles in response to median nerve stimulation was depressed in amplitude from 400 ms to 1 s after a muscle twitch induced by transcranial stimulation, root stimulation, direct biceps stimulation, and triceps tendon tap. Stimulation of the cutaneous branch of musculocutaneous nerve, ipsilateral triceps and contralateral biceps, and biceps tendon tap did not alter H-reflex size. Forearm flexor H-reflex amplitude is therefore related to changes in proprioceptive inflow secondary to the biceps muscle twitch. Root and direct muscle stimulation both failed to reduce the size of the motor evoked potential (MEP) after transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting that the inhibition acts at presynaptic level. Attenuation of H-reflex amplitude was related to the size of the muscle twitch and was less pronounced during an isometric twitch than during free joint movement. Our results suggest that the biceps muscle twitch produces long-lasting inhibition of the Ia afferents from forearm flexor muscles. This is an important and a simple mechanism for suppressing proprioceptive input during movement.", "pages": "748-52"}, {"volume": "247", "title": "Neurophysiological features of fasciculation potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10787113", "authors": ["de Carvalho, M", "Miranda, PC", "Lourdes Sales Lu\u00eds, M", "Ducla-Soares, E"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "We report 13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in whom fasciculation potentials (FPs) driven by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded. A total of 18 different FPs were analyzed. TMS-driven fasciculations had a simple morphology and were stable. Complex potentials were never cortically driven. Recruitment by a slight voluntary contraction was verified in 7 of 13 tested FPs. FPs were driven by threshold stimuli in 7 of 10 patients and by stimuli 5% below threshold in 3 of 6. Mapping demonstrated that FPs were driven in an area close to the center of gravity of the muscle cortical area. In one case FPs were evoked from most of the cortical representation area of a very weak muscle. Three other patients with profuse fasciculations associated with other clinical conditions were also studied. No TMS evoked fasciculation was observed in this group. The results of this systematic study suggest that cortically evoked FPs arise centrally, at spinal cord or even more proximally, and can represent a marker of increased corticomotor excitability, which is predominant at an earlier phase but can persist as the disease progresses.", "pages": "748-52"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "[ECT versus transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): preliminary data of computer modeling].", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "10776027", "authors": ["Zyss, T", "Krawczyk, A", "Drzyma\u0142a, P", "Starzy\u0144ski, J"], "year": "", "journal": "Psychiatria polska", "abstract": "The essential issue of electroshock therapy (ECT) is the activity of physical stimulus, i.e., the electric current, on the disturbed structures of the brain. ECT sessions--when chronically applied for evoking antidepressive effects--are responsible for the appearance of excessive incitement in the neuronal net in the brain tissue in a form of self-sustaining after-discharge (SSAD) (convulsive attack characteristic for ECT). The study presents the computer research on basic biophysical phenomena of electroshock therapy (flow of electric current in the structures of the head just before convulsive attack). Five-layer 3-D model of the head was created in OPERA-3D (Vector Fields Ltd., Oxford), general 3 dimensional issues solver. Geometrical dimensions and electrophysical properties of each layer correspond with natural properties. The model was subjected to the action of electric stimulation (parameters identical to those applied in clinical conditions). Analysis of the flow in particular layers revealed the crawling/spreading effect present not only in the scalp layer but also in the layer of cerebrospinal fluid. The effect is conditioned by \"deeper situated\" lesser conduction of electricity-respectively skull bones, brain tissue. Crawling effect is the reason why only 5-15% of the electricity applied on the surface of the head reaches the surface of the brain. Electro-stimulation examinations also showed that the values of the so called density of the current in layers of brain tissue balanced between 1-10 mA/mm2. The current parameters of ECT were effective in evoking subsequent convulsive attack and safe for the brain tissue. The model was subjected to the action of magnetic stimulation according to the parameters of neurologic technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). ELECTRA module was used to solve wire-current issues. The examination showed more regular distribution of current vectors in all layers of the head. The density of cerebral cortex was 0.1-1 mA/mm2, confirming markedly lesser current charge than that observed during ECT. The problem of magnetic stimulation efficacy in irritating deep structures of the brain demands further studies.", "pages": "748-52"}, {"volume": "123 ( Pt 5)", "title": "The effects of a volatile anaesthetic on the excitability of human corticospinal axons.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10775543", "authors": ["Burke, D", "Bartley, K", "Woodforth, IJ", "Yakoubi, A", "Stephen, JP"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "The recovery of excitability following a conditioning volley and the strength-duration properties of corticospinal axons were measured in 10 neurologically normal patients in whom corticospinal function was being monitored during scoliosis surgery. Corticospinal volleys were produced using transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex, and recorded from the spinal cord using epidural leads. Administration of a volatile anaesthetic, sevoflurane 2%, increased the threshold current required to produce a submaximal test volley by 35.8% (P = 0.0005), indicating that the anaesthetic depressed the excitability of the site at which the transcranial stimulus activated the corticospinal system. Following a strong transcranial stimulus, axons were relatively refractory for conditioning-test intervals up to approximately 2.5 ms, and then superexcitable for intervals of >10 ms. In two patients, the time course and extent of refractoriness and superexcitability did not differ when receiving sevoflurane 2% and after its withdrawal. Strength-duration properties were determined by measuring the stimulus current required to produce a submaximal corticospinal volley of fixed amplitude using test stimuli of different duration, from 50 micros to 1 ms. Strength-duration curves were well described by a hyperbolic function, with which there is a linear relationship between stimulus charge and stimulus duration. In the absence of sevoflurane, the strength-duration time constant (tau(SD)) was 432.2 +/- 70.5 micros. When sevoflurane 2% was administered to 6 patients, tau(SD) decreased to 203.7 +/- 93.8 micros, a change that was significant (P = 0.04). The decrease in tau(SD) was accompanied by an increase in rheobase. These findings imply that the lowest-threshold component of the corticospinal volley produced by transcranial electrical stimulation probably arises from nodes of Ranvier of corticospinal axons, where it would not be affected by changes in the excitability of cortical neurons. It is suggested that the increase in threshold produced by sevoflurane is due to depression of Na(+) currents at the nodes of Ranvier of corticospinal axons.", "pages": "748-52"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Low dose propofol as a supplement to ketamine-based anesthesia during intraoperative monitoring of motor-evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "10767811", "authors": ["Kawaguchi, M", "Sakamoto, T", "Inoue, S", "Kakimoto, M", "Furuya, H", "Morimoto, T", "Sakaki, T"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were analyzed using transcranial electrical stimulation during spinal surgery in patients under ketamine-based anesthesia, with and without propofol.", "pages": "748-52"}, {"volume": "131", "title": "Changes in muscle responses to stimulation of the motor cortex induced by peripheral nerve stimulation in human subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10759179", "authors": ["Ridding, MC", "Brouwer, B", "Miles, TS", "Pitcher, JB", "Thompson, PD"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
