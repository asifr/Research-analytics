Changes of MEP were observed in all 4 patients. Temporary decrease of MEP amplitudes as found in two patients was not followed by any additional postoperative neurological deficits. Incomplete recovery of amplitudes in one case associated with a corresponding hemiparesis post-angiographically. In the last patient amplitude reduction was found one week after the second embolization of an av-angioma. Consequently, an angiographic control was performed early, showing a partial revascularisation by newly opened fistulae which needed to be embolized again. In our opinion, monitoring of MEP during interventional neuroradiology is a sensitive method for early detection of impending neurological deficits. The use of MEP monitoring is discussed with respect to the advantages and limitations of conventional SEP monitoring. Because of the discomfort associated with electrical stimulation a magnetic stimulator may be used.", "pages": "252-5"}, {"volume": "144", "title": "[Motor evoked potentials.

This reproducible and non invasive technique gives the possibility to elicit unilaterally or bilaterally evoked motor potentials. It is possible to define a Total Conduction Time (TCT) from cortex to muscle and a Peripheral Conduction Time (PCT) from spinal cord to muscle. The central conduction time is given by the latency difference between TCT and PCT. This delay represents the duration of the descending corticospinal volley plus the delay necessary to depolarize spinal motor neurons. For central pathways supplying the upper limbs TCT is 4.3 milliseconds and for central pathways supplying the lower limbs TCT is 9.3 milliseconds. This technique of central motorpathway assessment can be used to define the magnitude of a central motor deficit in neurological diseases affecting the corticospinal tract, during surgical procedures involving the spinal cord and in comatose patients. The new magnetic stimulation is painless and will probably widen the utilization of this method.", "pages": "252-5"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Evaluation of proximal facial nerve conduction by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "3351531", "authors": ["Schriefer, TN", "Mills, KR", "Murray, NM", "Hess, CW"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "A magnetic stimulator was used for direct transcutaneous stimulation of the intracranial portion of the facial nerve in 15 normal subjects and in patients with Bell's palsy, demyelinating neuropathy, traumatic facial palsy and pontine glioma.

No response to magnetic stimulation could be recorded from the affected side in 15 of 16 patients with Bell's palsy. Serial studies in two patients demonstrated that the facial nerve remained inexcitable by magnetic stimulation despite marked improvement in clinical function. In the patient with a pontine glioma, the CMAP elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation was of low amplitude but normal latency. In six of seven patients with demyelinating neuropathy, the response to intracranial magnetic stimulation was significantly delayed.

We examined the spinal and transcranial stimulated motor responses of the muscle opponens pollicis without preinnervation in 18 healthy volunteers.

It was demonstrated that parameters, such as voluntary background innervation (see Fig. 1) and stimulation strength (see Fig. 2) have great influence on both the latencies and the amplitudes of these responses (see Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, as a prerequisite for an interpretation of latencies to cortically evoked responses as being normal or abnormal is a detailed description of the conditions under which the responses have been obtained. Additionally the individual conduction distances along the central and peripheral motor pathways have to be taken into account (see Fig. 5). Furthermore it is shown that the combination of cortex stimulation and stimulation on spinal level with the aim of a fractionated determination of central motor conduction velocities suffers from several limitations. The main limitation arises from the observation that the excited parts of the motor system are non-congruent (see Fig. 6). Isolated high-cervical tract stimulation exciting motoneurones of the upper extremity frequently could not be performed since the excitation threshold of the motor roots is much lower than that of the descending motor tracts (see Fig. 6 and 7).", "pages": "252-5"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "[Possibilities and limits of determining central motor conduction latencies in the human].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "3873019", "authors": ["Meyer, BU", "Benecke, R", "G\u00f6hmann, M", "Zipper, S", "Conrad, B"], "year": "1987", "journal": "EEG-EMG Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektroenzephalographie, Elektromyographie und verwandte Gebiete", "abstract": "A conspicuous feature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is atonia of postural muscles due to a powerful brainstem inhibitory effect on spinal motoneurones.

Transcranial cortical stimuli (TCCS) were used to elicit motor responses in contralateral wrist flexor and extensor muscles of healthy adult subjects. The motor responses were assessed by surface EMG recordings, by needle recordings of single motor-unit discharges, and by measurements of wrist twitch force. Our main aim was to analyze the single-unit events underlying those changes in latency, amplitude, and duration of the compound EMG responses, which could be induced by voluntary preactivation of target muscles and by changes in stimulation strength. 2. Different stimulus strengths were tested with and without background contractions in the flexor or extensor muscles. For each test (consisting of a series of 20 stimuli) the compound EMG responses were averaged and displayed together with the averaged wrist force signals. Responses of individual flexor and extensor motor units were displayed in raster diagrams and peristimulus time histograms. For units exhibiting a background firing, the mean background interdischarge interval was calculated and compared with the subsequent poststimulus intervals. 3. In relaxed muscles, a shortening of onset latency of evoked compound EMG responses was observed when raising stimulation strength. A similar latency reduction was not seen in any of the single-unit recordings. This would be consistent with the size principle of motoneuron recruitment. 4. A shortening of onset latency of evoked EMG potentials was observed also as a result of a voluntary preactivation. Such latency shifts, which were seen also in single-unit recordings, might be attributed to variations in the time required for D and I wave temporal summation at the anterior horn cell. 5. When raising stimulation strength or when adding voluntary background contraction, the evoked compound EMG potential grew not only in amplitude but also in duration, as later peaks of activity were added to the initial ones. Under optimal conditions (strong stimulus + background contraction), the period of excitation (termed E1) had an onset latency of approximately 15 ms and a duration of approximately 35 ms and was similar for wrist flexor and extensor muscles. 6. We never saw the same flexor or extensor unit fire more than once during the E1 period. For units preactivated by a background contraction, the stimulus-triggered impulse exhibited latency shifts, which, to a large extent, depended on the timing of the stimulus in relation to a preceding background discharge and which could be influenced by a change in stimulation strength.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "252-5"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Motor-unit responses in human wrist flexor and extensor muscles to transcranial cortical stimuli.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "2860322", "authors": ["Calancie, B", "Nordin, M", "Wallin, U", "Hagbarth, KE"], "year": "1987", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Monitoring of the nervous system using evoked potentials is a developing tool. A new evoked potential, the motor-evoked potential (MEP), based on a traditional test, uses brain stimulation to monitor the motor system. The MEP complements the existing modalities, which are wholly sensory. The MEP can be prompted by direct stimulation of the motor cortex, but, in a more general way, by transcranial stimulation. Electric or magnetic means can be used. One electric system involves placement of an electrode on the scalp over the motor cortex, paired with a cathodal plate on the roof of the hard palate. Recording electrodes are placed over the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Signals are recorded with a standard, evoked-potential, signal-averaging computer. Animal studies indicate that the electric stimulus activates primarily the pyramidal system to produce a descending evoked potential in the ventral and dorsolateral spinal cord. It is more sensitive than the sensory-evoked potential to spinal cord injury produced by the weight-drop method in cats. The peripheral nerve responses, much more sensitive to injury than the cord responses, can be altered by metabolic abnormalities. To date, the MEP has been an accurate indicator of ambulation in chronic spinal cord injury in animals. Parallel clinical development in the operating room has shown that the test is valuable; and it monitors brainstem or cortex manipulation, as well as cord manipulation. Safety studies are encouraging. The MEP is developmentally and technically demanding, but it has produced high quality signals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "252-5"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex to produce motor-evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1059308", "authors": ["Levy, WJ"], "year": "1987", "journal": "Medical instrumentation", "abstract": "", "pages": "252-5"}]
