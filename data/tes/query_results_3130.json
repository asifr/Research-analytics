In order to define the mechanism and the site of action of this inhibitory phenomenon, we recorded descending volleys produced by the test stimulus through high cervical, epidural electrodes implanted for pain relief in three conscious subjects. These could be compared with simultaneously recorded EMG responses in hand muscles. When the test stimulus was given on its own it evoked three waves of activity (I-waves) in the spinal cord, and a small EMG response in the hand. A prior conditioning stimulus to the other hemisphere suppressed the size of both the descending spinal cord volleys and the EMG responses evoked by the test stimulus when the interstimulus interval was greater than 6 ms. In the spinal recordings, the effect was most marked for the last I-wave (I3), whereas the second I2-wave was only slightly inhibited, and the first I-wave (I1) was not inhibited at all. We conclude that transcranial stimulation over the lateral part of the motor cortex of one hemisphere can suppress the excitability of the contralateral motor cortex.", "pages": "520-4"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "A clinical study on the magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10089982", "authors": ["Yamakawa, T", "Yoshikawa, H", "Arai, A", "Miyazaki, T", "Ichikawa, G"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "abstract": "A clinical study on the usefulness of magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve, with special attention paid to the selection of the coil shape and stimulation procedures.", "pages": "520-4"}, {"volume": "822", "title": "Transcranial electrical stimulation (Limoge's currents) potentiates the inhibition of righting reflex induced by droperidol in rats.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "10082891", "authors": ["Robert, C", "Limoge, A", "Stinus, L"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The subjects consisted of 55 patients with Bell's palsy, 1 patient with a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumor, 1 patient with multiple sclerosis (MS), and 30 normal subjects.

TCES (high frequency (HF)-166 kHz, intermittent-100 Hz current) delivered through three electrodes (a negative electrode placed between the eyebrows and positive electrodes located in the retro-mastoid region) was shown to potentiate the inhibition of righting reflex induced by droperidol. This potentiation was found to depend on the dose of the drug, the characteristics of the current delivered and the duration of stimulation. We also observed that TCES-induced potentiation of inhibition of righting reflex produced by droperidol injection was not reversed: (i) after naltrexone administration, (ii) when measures were performed on p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA)-treated animals. These results suggest that, under the experimental conditions: (i) TCES does not interact with opioid endogenous to potentiate droperidol effects, (ii) the effect of TCES on dopaminergic system prevails against TCES action on serotonergic system.

Magnetic transcranial stimulation was accomplished with a transcranial stimulator set at maximal output (2 T). Just before skin incision, triplicate responses to single stimuli with both modes of cortical stimulation were randomly recorded from the tibialis anterior muscles. Amplitudes and latencies were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Bilateral tc-MEP responses were obtained in every patient with electrical stimulation. Magnetic stimulation evoked only unilateral responses in two patients.
