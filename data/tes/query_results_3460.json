The possibility was investigated that, in man, some of the descending command for tonic voluntary wrist extension is transmitted to extensor motoneurones over a non-monosynaptic pathway. 2. Stimulation of the cutaneous superficial radial nerve at 3 times perceptual threshold depressed the electromyogram (EMG) of extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the discharge of single ECR motor units, both with a mean central delay of 4.2 ms. Such stimuli depressed the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, but had little effect on the H reflex. 3. The possibility that the relative sparing of the H reflex was due to an alteration in transmission of the afferent volley for the H reflex was excluded. 4. The central latency of the cutaneous-induced depression of the discharge of single motor units in biceps brachii (C5-C6) was shorter by about 1 ms than that of the more caudal wrist and finger extensor motor units. This suggests that the locus for the cutaneous-induced effects was spinal but above the cervical enlargement. 5. The pattern of EMG depression (evoked by superficial radial but not palmar stimuli, in wrist extensors but not wrist flexors) is that previously described for the presumed propriospinal system of human subjects. 6. It is concluded that a significant component of the voluntary command for tonic wrist extension reaches the relevant motoneurone pool via a non-monosynaptic pathway. It is suggested that the interposed neurones could be C3-C4 propriospinal neurones.", "pages": "191-202"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Follow-up investigations of peripheral facial palsy by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "14202449", "authors": ["Kotterba, S", "Jaspert, A", "Tegenthoff, M", "Malin, JP"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Twenty-three patients (10 men, 13 women; age: from 23 to 81 years, mean 52 years) with Bell's palsy were investigated by magneto-electrical stimulation in order to evaluate the usefulness of this method for prognostication. At each examination the facial nerve was electrically stimulated, and an orbicularis-oculi-reflex was elicited. Follow-up investigations were possible in 13 patients. All patients showed pathological long- and short-latency responses at the first examination. The blink reflex examination revealed a pathological result in all cases. The responses to electrical stimulation were pathological only in 35%. The follow-up examinations revealed that the analysis of the short-latency response did not give a prognostic information. In contrast, maintained elicitation of the long-latency response pointed to a favourable prognosis. In follow-up investigations, the increase of amplitude and the decrease of latency of the long-latency response correlated with a complete recovery, while the decrease of amplitude and the increase of latency correlated with a partial recovery. The improvement of the responses in magnetic stimulation preceded the clinical improvement. By using magnetic stimulation, an early registration and evaluation of the course of Bell's palsy are possible.", "pages": "191-202"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "[Omega-potential dynamics during lateralized transcranial electric stimulation].", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "6875895", "authors": ["Lomarev, MP", "Malinina, SA", "Kozhushko, NIu", "Eryshev, OF", "Eroshin, SP"], "year": "", "journal": "Fiziologiia cheloveka", "abstract": "The effects of upper extremity weight-bearing on the excitability of corticospinal neurons projecting to the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle of patients having had cerebrovascular accidents (strokes) were examined. Alternate transcranial magnetic and ulnar nerve stimulation were applied and peristimulus time histograms of single FCU motor unit discharge times were generated to provide information about the cortical and segmental postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), respectively. Recordings from 10 patients and 5 control subjects indicated the cortically evoked PSPs were initially abnormally small in the stroke group (p < .01). Following weight-bearing the cortical projection strength to FCU motoneurons increased in stroke patients (p < .05) only. The composite group Ia PSP was reduced in 2 patients, but data could not be obtained from the remaining subjects. It is concluded that upper extremity weight-bearing normalizes corticospinal facilitation of FCU motor units in stroke patients.

The responsible mechanism is apparently decreased efficiency in the generation of the descending volleys in the motor cortex. We also noted a progressive decrement in amplitude from the first to the fourth MEP. To further clarify the mechanism of this phenomenon, 5 subjects were studied with TMS delivered at the rates of 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 1, 3, and 6 Hz. The effect was best demonstrated at 0.3 Hz, and occurred after both isometric and isotonic exercise. Three of the subjects also had 0.3-Hz percutaneous electrical stimulation of the brainstem, and a decrement in MEP amplitude did not occur. Further, the delivery of TMS during muscle contraction after muscle fatigue failed to produce a decrement. The results are similar to those found at the neuromuscular junction in myasthenia gravis and are consistent with a reduced safety factor of cortical synaptic transmission in central nervous system fatigue.", "pages": "191-202"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Resetting of essential tremor and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "8135121", "authors": ["Pascual-Leone, A", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Toro, C", "Wassermann, EM", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Voluntary contraction of hand muscles increases compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes evoked by submaximal electrical percutaneous cervical stimulation (EPCS).

CMAP amplitudes increased with voluntary contraction of the target muscle, regardless of type or location of stimulus (P < 0.001). No increase in CMAP amplitude occurred when a conditioning transcranial stimulus was employed with EPCS (P = 0.35).

In this study suppression in the firing of tonically active low threshold single motoneurons following low intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation is described in health and disease. Changes in firing probability in the absence of an early excitatory response were studied in a total of 14 motor units from 4 healthy subjects, 5 patients with multiple sclerosis, and 1 patient with stroke. Firing probability began to fall 18-59 ms after the stimulus and remained low for a period of 27-133 ms. There were no obvious differences between the three subject groups. The change in firing probability was not associated with specific physical signs. Late rises in firing probability were seen in 7 of the 14 motor units at latencies that were similar to the secondary peak which is known to occur with higher stimulus intensities.

Fourteen out of the seventeen studied patients showed CMCT abnormalities. No significative correlation was found between the intensity of muscle weakness and the slowness of conduction in the corresponding PTs. Subclinical abnormalities were detected in more than half of the studied patients. CMCT slowness showed a good correlation with the time course of the disease in the cortico-cervical (CCT) but not in the cortico-lumbar (CLT) tracts. Evidence favoring the existence of two different lesional levels along the PSs was found in 9 out of the 14 patients studied with recordings in the hand and leg muscles. Two patterns of abnormalities gave support to this conclusion. The first consisted of slowed conduction or inexcitability in both the CCT and CLT at one side, while only one of the contralateral PTs was impaired. In the second one, the 4 explored PTs showed a slowed conduction, but in addition, CMCT difference between the CLT and CCT was longer than normal. Both patterns suggest that one lesional level could be situated between the internal capsula and the lower cervical cord and the other in the spine below the 8th cervical methamera or in the corona radiata.", "pages": "191-202"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Suppression and long latency excitation of single spinal motoneurons by transcranial magnetic stimulation in health, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "7182471", "authors": ["Boniface, SJ", "Schubert, M", "Mills, KR"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "", "pages": "191-202"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Multiple sclerosis: assessment of lesional levels by means of transcranial stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "6160982", "authors": ["Segura, MJ", "Garcea, O", "Gandolfo, CN", "Sica, RE"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "191-202"}]
