It is not known whether proximal arm representations exhibit comparable effects on their homologous counterparts. We studied IHI in different arm representations, targeting triceps brachii (TB, n = 13), first dorsal interosseous (FDI, n = 13), and biceps brachii (BB, n = 7) muscles in healthy volunteers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation test stimuli (TS) were delivered to M1 contralateral to the target muscle preceded 10 ms by a conditioning stimulus (CS) to the opposite M1 at 110-150% resting motor threshold (RMT). IHI was calculated as the ratio between motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes in conditioned relative to unconditioned trials. Mean RMTs were 38.9, 46.9, and 46.0% of stimulator output in FDI, TB, and BB muscles, respectively. IHI was 0.45 +/- 0.41 (FDI), 0.78 +/- 0.38 (TB), and 0.52 +/- 0.32 (BB, P < 0.01) when test MEP amplitudes were matched and 0.28 +/- 0.17 (FDI) and 0.85 +/- 0.31 (TB, P < 0.05) when TS intensities expressed as percentage RMT were matched. Significant IHI (P < 0.05) was identified with minimal CS intensities (expressed as percentage stimulator output) in the 30 s for FDI, 60 s for TB, and 40 s for BB. Additionally, a CS of roughly 120% RMT suppressed the test MEP but not a test H-reflex in BB, suggesting IHI observed in BB is likely mediated by a supraspinal mechanism. We conclude that IHI differs between different arm muscle representations, comparable between BB and FDI but lesser for TB. This finding suggests the amount of IHI between different arm representations does not strictly follow a proximal-to-distal gradient, but may be related to the role of each muscle in functional movement synergies.", "pages": "2511-5"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "The role of the cerebellum in subsecond time perception: evidence from repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17214571", "authors": ["Lee, KH", "Egleston, PN", "Brown, WH", "Gregory, AN", "Barker, AT", "Woodruff, PW"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "In three experiments, we investigated the role of the cerebellum in sub- and suprasecond time perception by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). In Experiment 1, subjects underwent four 8-min 1-Hz rTMS sessions in a within-subject design. rTMS sites were the medial cerebellum (real and sham rTMS), left lateral cerebellum, and right lateral cerebellum. Following each rTMS session, subjects completed a subsecond temporal bisection task (stimuli in the range 400-800 msec). Compared with sham rTMS, rTMS applied over the right lateral or medial cerebellum induced a leftward shift of the psychophysical function (perceived lengthening of time). In Experiment 2, a separate sample of subjects underwent the identical rTMS procedure and completed a suprasecond bisection task (stimuli in the 1000-2000 msec range). In this experiment, rTMS to the cerebellar sites did not produce any significant changes compared with sham rTMS. Experiment 3 employed a within-subject design to replicate findings from Experiments 1 and 2. Subjects underwent four rTMS conditions (sub- and suprabisection tasks following medial cerebellar and sham rTMS). rTMS induced a significant leftward shift of psychophysical function in the subsecond bisection, but not in the suprasecond bisection. In this study, we have demonstrated that transient cerebellar stimulation can differently affect the ability to estimate time intervals below and above a duration of 1 sec. The results of this study provide direct evidence for the role of the cerebellum in processing subsecond time intervals. This study further suggests that the perception of sub- and suprasecond intervals is likely to depend upon distinct neural systems.", "pages": "2511-5"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Expectancy induces dynamic modulation of corticospinal excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17214569", "authors": ["van Elswijk, G", "Kleine, BU", "Overeem, S", "Stegeman, DF"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Behavioral studies using motor preparation paradigms have revealed that increased expectancy of a response signal shortens reaction times (RTs). Neurophysiological data suggest that in such paradigms, not only RT but also neuronal activity in the motor structures involved is modulated by expectancy of behaviorally relevant events. Here, we directly tested whether expectancy of a response signal modulates excitability of the corticospinal system used in the subsequent movement. We combined single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex with a simple RT task with variable preparatory delays. We found that, in line with typical behavioral observations, the subjects' RTs decreased with increasing response signal expectancy. TMS results revealed a modulation of corticospinal excitability in correspondence with response signal expectancy. Besides an increased excitability over the time-course of the preparatory delay, corticospinal excitability transiently increased whenever a response signal was expected. Paired-pulse TMS showed that this modulation is unlikely to be mediated by excitability changes in interneuronal inhibitory or facilitatory networks in the primary motor cortex. Changes in corticospinal synchronization or other mechanisms involving spinal circuits are candidates mediating the modulation of corticospinal excitability by expectancy.", "pages": "2511-5"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Cortical reorganization following bimanual training and somatosensory stimulation in cervical spinal cord injury: a case report.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17213410", "authors": ["Hoffman, LR", "Field-Fote, EC"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Physical therapy", "abstract": "Deficits in upper-extremity function in individuals with tetraplegia are primarily due to the loss of motor pathways.
