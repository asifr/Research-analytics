The controversy arises from the differences of the stimulation parameters and evaluation methods of the effects in those studies. Furthermore, placebo effects are common in trials of therapy for PD. The Japanese multi-center, double blinded, sham stimulation controlled trial showed an efficacy in both the rTMS-treated and control patients. The stimulation parameters used in this trial showed some efficacy; however, the degree of the effects were not significantly different from randomized, controlled patients. The result does not prove the efficacy of the rTMS; on the other hand, it does not rule out the efficacy. Further trials are necessary to reveal the therapeutic effect of rTMS in PD.

Trains of stimuli (at 5 Hz frequency, and suprathreshold intensity) progressively increase the size of muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, gabapentin, and topiramate on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the changes in motor threshold, MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in 23 patients with neuropathic pain before and after a 1-week course of treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, topiramate and placebo. None of the three antiepileptic drugs changed the resting or active magnetic and electrical motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment, but not placebo, abolished the normal rTMS-induced facilitation of MEPs, but left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. Our results suggest that carbamazepine, gabapentin and topiramate modulate intracortical excitability by acting selectively on excitatory interneurons.", "pages": "2071-80"}]
