The relationship between structure and function as the major feature constituting a brain mapping modality can therefore not be established. Recent advances in image processing allowed us to refine TMS by combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities with TMS using a neuronavigation system to measure the position of the stimulating coil and map this position onto a MRI data set. This technique has several advantages over recent TMS mapping strategies. The position of the coil on the scalp can be held constant as verified by real time visual guidance. When evaluating higher cortical functions, the relationship between underlying cortical anatomy and the scalp stimulation site can be accurately assessed. Cortical motor output maps can be easily obtained for preoperative planning and decision making for mass lesions near rolandic cortex in patients. In conclusion, navigated TMS is a reliable alternative for localizing cortical functions and therefore may be a useful adjunct or in selected patients even a helpful alternative to other functional neuroimaging methods.", "pages": "171-9"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Spinal cord monitoring: somatosensory- and motor-evoked potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11778387", "authors": ["de Haan, P", "Kalkman, CJ"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Anesthesiology clinics of North America", "abstract": "Monitoring myogenic motor EPs after transcranial electrical stimulation is effective in detecting spinal cord ischemia. During thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, this technique is sufficiently rapid to allow timely interventions aimed at correcting ischemic conditions and preserving spinal cord blood flow. If strategies are applied to protect the spinal cord during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (e.g., distal bypass, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, reattachment of segmental arteries), motor EP monitoring should be included in this protocol to improve neurologic outcome further. Although SSEPs provide information regarding the adequacy of spinal cord blood flow, monitoring SSEPs during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair has serious limitations. The response time is too slow to be of practical use. SSEPs also do not provide information regarding anterior horn motor function and supply, whereas the motor neurons in the anterior horn are most likely to sustain ischemic injury.", "pages": "171-9"}, {"volume": "538", "title": "Cortically evoked neural volleys to the human hand are increased during ischaemic block of the forearm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "11773335", "authors": ["McNulty, PA", "Macefield, VG", "Taylor, JL", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Reorganisation of the motor cortex may occur after limb amputation or spinal cord injury. In humans, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) shows expansion of motor cortical representations of muscles proximal to the injury. Similarly, ischaemic block of the hand can increase acutely the representation of the biceps muscle, measured by increased biceps motor potentials evoked by TMS. It is thought that this increase occurs at the expense of the cortical representation of the paralysed and deafferented hand muscles but this has never been investigated. To study what changes occur in the cortical representation of the hand muscles during ischaemic block, a tungsten microelectrode was inserted into the ulnar or median nerve above the elbow and the size of the neural potential elicited by TMS in fascicles supplying the hand was measured in seven subjects. Prior to ischaemia, TMS evoked EMG responses in the intrinsic hand muscles. In the nerve, a brief motor potential preceded the response in the muscle and was followed by a contraction-induced sensory potential. During 40 min of ischaemia produced by a blood pressure cuff inflated around the forearm to 210 mmHg, the EMG response to TMS and the sensory potential from the hand were progressively blocked. However, the motor neural evoked potential showed a significant increase in amplitude during the ischaemic period (30.5 %, P = 0.005). The increase in the neural potential suggests that output to the hand evoked from the cortex by TMS was not decreased by ischaemic block. Thus, we conclude that the increased response of biceps to TMS during distal ischaemia is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the motor cortical representation of the hand.", "pages": "171-9"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Simulating transcranial magnetic stimulation during PET with a large-scale neural network model of the prefrontal cortex and the visual system.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9437031", "authors": ["Husain, FT", "Nandipati, G", "Braun, AR", "Cohen, LG", "Tagamets, MA", "Horwitz, B"], "year": "2002", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) exerts both excitatory and inhibitory effects on the stimulated neural tissue, although little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms by which it influences neuronal function. TMS has been used in conjunction with PET to examine interregional connectivity of human cerebral cortex. To help understand how TMS affects neuronal function, and how these effects are manifested during functional brain imaging, we simulated the effects of TMS on a large-scale neurobiologically realistic computational model consisting of multiple, interconnected regions that performs a visual delayed-match-to-sample task. The simulated electrical activities in each region of the model are similar to those found in single-cell monkey data, and the simulated integrated summed synaptic activities match regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data obtained in human PET studies. In the present simulations, the excitatory and inhibitory effects of TMS on both locally stimulated and distal sites were studied using simulated behavioral measures and simulated PET rCBF results. The application of TMS to either excitatory or inhibitory units of the model, or both, resulted in an increased number of errors in the task performed by the model. In experimental studies, both increases and decreases in rCBF following TMS have been observed. In the model, increasing TMS intensity caused an increase in rCBF when TMS exerted a predominantly excitatory effect, whereas decreased rCBF following TMS occurred if TMS exerted a predominantly inhibitory effect. We also found that regions both directly and indirectly connected to the stimulating site were affected by TMS.", "pages": "171-9"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "[The therapy of non-traumatic vegetative state syndrome in children].", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "10845069", "authors": ["Evtushenko, SK", "Omel'ianenko, AA"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

We also examined the origin of the evoked potentials obtained by the magnetic stimulation. The following results were obtained. The magnetic induction flux density was at its maximum at the edge of the coil. The potentials consisted of a first negative wave and subsequent multiphasic waves. The first negative wave was similar to a response of the subcorticospinal tract in the lower brain stem, while the subsequent multiphasic waves were similar to those of the pyramidal tract.

Through a small thoracic T11-T12 laminotomy, an insulated double bipolar electrode was inserted epidurally and cephalad in seven cynomolgus monkeys. Thoracic spinal TMS-MEPs, and SEPs, were tested against graded increase of KH doses (0.01, 0.018, 0.032, 0.056, 0.1, and 0.18 mg kg(-1) min(-1) i.v. infusion). The direct (D-) and indirect (I-) epidural MEP peaks were well-defined under sole KH infusion. The waveforms were consistent at various dosages. At the highest cumulative dose (0.18 mg kg(-1) min(-1), total 6.5 mg kg(-1) over 150 min), I5 was host and I3 and I4 latencies were delayed. The scalp and spinal SEP showed no significant change. Recording of both neural D- and I- MEPs and SEPs is feasible under high sole i.v. KH. It is the first agent to maintain up to four later I1 peaks. The reproducibility of both modalities is unquestionable under KH-based deep anesthesia. This reflects the maintenance of state of neural excitability under KH.", "pages": "171-9"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Functional MRI of cortical activations induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).", "keywords": [], "issue": "16", "pmid": "10507536", "authors": ["Baudewig, J", "Siebner, HR", "Bestmann, S", "Tergau, F", "Tings, T", "Paulus, W", "Frahm, J"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on human brain activity and associated hemodynamics were investigated by blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI using echo-planar imaging at 2.0 T. Apart from bilateral activation of the auditory cortex by the audible rTMS discharges (23 bursts, 1 s duration, 10 Hz, 10-20 s interstimulus intervals), BOLD responses were restricted to cortical representations of actual finger movements performed either voluntarily or evoked by suprathreshold rTMS of the motor cortex. Neither subthreshold rTMS of the motor cortex nor suprathreshold rTMS of the lateral premotor cortex induced a detectable BOLD response. These findings suggest that neuronal depolarization as induced by rTMS modulates the spiking output of a brain area but does not automatically alter cerebral blood flow and oxygenation.

High-frequency rTMS (20 Hz) caused more relative flow immediately below the TMS coil than did low-frequency rTMS (5 Hz).

Descending corticospinal volleys evoked after transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation of the leg area of the motor cortex were recorded from an electrode in the spinal epidural space of six conscious patients who had electrodes implanted for treatment of chronic pain, and from one anaesthetised patient undergoing surgery for a spinal tumour. 2. At threshold, the shortest-latency volley (L1 volley) was evoked by stimulation with an anode 2 cm lateral to the vertex. Anodal stimulation at the vertex also elicited a volley at this latency in two patients, but in the other patients the first volley evoked appeared 1-1.3 ms later (L2 volley), at the same latency as the initial volley evoked by magnetic stimulation. High-intensity stimulation of any type could evoke both the L1 and L2 waves as well as later ones (L3, L4, etc.) that had a periodicity of about 1.5 ms. 3. Voluntary contraction increased the amplitude of the L2 and later volleys, but had no effect on the L1 volley. 4. Intracortical inhibition between pairs of magnetic stimuli resulted in clear suppression of the L4 and later waves. The L2 and L3 waves were unaffected. 5. In the anaesthetised patient the L1 volley occurred 1.7 ms later than the volley produced by transmastoid stimulation of the corticospinal pathways in the brainstem. 6. The L1 volley is likely to be a D wave produced by the direct activation of pyramidal axons in the subcortical white matter; the L2 and later volleys are likely to be I waves produced by the trans-synaptic activation of corticospinal neurones. The implication is that electrical stimulation with an anode at the vertex is more likely to evoke I waves preferentially than stimulation over the hand area. A more secure way to ensure D wave activation of corticospinal fibres from the leg area is to place the anode 2 cm lateral to the vertex.", "pages": "171-9"}]
