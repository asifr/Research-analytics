In the present experiments we have used the technique of transcallosal inhibition between the motor cortices to examine all three effects in the same protocol. Ten healthy subjects received 900 rTMS stimuli at 1 Hz from a figure of eight coil over the left motor hand area. The intensity of rTMS was above the threshold for inducing short latency interhemispherical inhibition with a single stimulus (equivalent to 115-120 % resting motor threshold). Before and after the rTMS we evaluated: (1) in the left hemisphere, the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and contralateral and ipsilateral cortical silent periods (CSP, ISP); (2) in the right hemisphere, MEP, CSP, ISP and short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation (SICI/ICF), and (3) interhemispherical inhibition (IHI) from the left-to-right hemisphere using a paired-pulse method. There were two main effects after rTMS to the left hemisphere: first, the amplitude of MEPs from the right hemisphere increased; second, there was a reduction in the IHI from the left-to-right hemisphere at interstimulus intervals of 7 and 10 ms but not at longer intervals (15-75 ms). Control experiments showed that these effects were not due to afferent inputs produced by the muscle twitches induced during the rTMS. The data are compatible with the notion that rTMS to the left hemisphere leads to reduced interhemispherical inhibition of the right hemisphere and a consequent increase in corticospinal excitability in that hemisphere.", "pages": "563-73"}, {"volume": "551", "title": "Differential effect of muscle vibration on intracortical inhibitory circuits in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "11459686", "authors": ["Rosenkranz, K", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Low amplitude muscle vibration (0.5 ms; 80 Hz; duration 1.5 s) was applied in turn to each of three different intrinsic hand muscles (first dorsal interosseus, FDI; abductor pollicis brevis, APB; and abductor digiti minimi, ADM) in order to test its effect on the EMG responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Recordings were also taken from flexor and extensor carpi radialis (FCR and ECR, respectively). We evaluated the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by a single TMS pulse, short interval intracortical inhibition and facilitation (SICI and ICF) and long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI). TMS pulses were applied 1 s after the start of vibration with subjects relaxed throughout. Vibration increased the amplitude of MEPs evoked in the vibrated muscle (162 +/- 6 % of MEP with no vibration; mean +/- S.E.M.), but suppressed MEPs in the two non-vibrated hand muscles (72 +/- 9 %). Compared with no vibration (test response reduced to 51 +/- 5 % of control), there was less SICI in the vibrated muscle (test response reduced to 92 +/- 28 % of control) and more in the non-vibrated hand muscles (test response reduced to 27 +/- 5 % of control). The opposite occurred for LICI: compared with the no vibration condition (test response reduced to 33 +/- 6 % control), there was more LICI in the vibrated muscle (test response reduced to 17 +/- 3 % control) than in the non-vibrated hand muscles (test response reduced to 80 +/- 11 % control) even when the intensity of the test stimulus was adjusted to compensate for the changes in baseline MEP. There was no effect on ICF. Cutaneous stimulation of the index finger (80 Hz, 1.5 s duration, twice sensory threshold) had no consistent differential effect on any of the parameters. We conclude that vibratory input from muscle can differentially modulate excitability in motor cortical circuits.", "pages": "563-73"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess cortical plasticity: a critical perspective for stroke rehabilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "41 Suppl", "pmid": "11165526", "authors": ["Butler, AJ", "Wolf, SL"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of rehabilitation medicine : official journal of the UEMS European Board of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation has gained increasing visibility as an evaluative and interventional tool during the past 15 years.

The objective of the study was to investigate the role of extrastriate cortex in illusory contour perception inducing 1 Hz rTMS interference in healthy subjects. Eight healthy subjects underwent 1 Hz rTMS (600 pulses) through a figure-of-eight coil over right and left occipital cortex (O1 and O2 of 10/20 EEG system); sham magnetic stimulation on the same sites and right motor cortex rTMS (in three subjects) were given as control. Subjects performed a computerized task requiring perception of illusory and real contours of Kanizsa squares in baseline and after rTMS. After stimulus presentation the subject made a forced-choice decision about the regularity or irregularity of stimulus contour, by hitting as fast as possible one of two keys on the computer keyboard. Reaction times (RT) were measured. Right occipital stimulation significantly increased RT for illusory contour perception (vs. baseline, P < 0.05). No significant RT changes were observed in the other experimental conditions with respect to the baseline condition. It is concluded that 1Hz rTMS of right extrastriate cortex can disrupt perception of illusory contours and the effect appears to be side-specific, being evident only after right occipital stimulation.

The aim of this study was to assess metabolic changes by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy following high-frequency rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (20 Hz), both immediately after a single session and 24 h after a series of five consecutive sessions. Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a prospective single-blind, randomized study [sham (n = 5) vs. real (n = 7)]. Three brain regions were investigated (right, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex). A single as well as a series of consecutive rapid transcranial magnetic stimulations affected cortical glutamate/glutamine levels. These effects were present not only close to the stimulation site (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), but also in remote (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left cingulate cortex) brain regions. Remarkably, the observed changes in glutamate/glutamine levels were dependent on the pre-transcranial magnetic stimulation glutamate/glutamine concentration, i.e. the lower the pre-stimulation glutamate/glutamine level, the higher the glutamate/glutamine increase observed after short- or long-term stimulation (5 days). In general, the treatment was well tolerated and no serious side-effects were reported. Neither transient mood changes nor significant differences in the outcome of a series of neuropsychological test batteries after real or sham transcranial magnetic stimulation occurred in our experiment.
