To this end, the relation between various stimulus intensities applied via transcranial magnetic stimulation and the size of motor evoked potentials was investigated in six healthy subjects during elbow flexion and extension. The measured I/O property demonstrates a sigmoidal shape, and is characterized by a plateau value, maximum slope and threshold. The results demonstrated that both the plateau value and maximum slope were significantly lower during LEN contraction than during SHO contraction (P<0.05), whereas the threshold was found not to be significantly different. These results suggest that both the maximum excitation level and the gain of the corticospinal tract are reduced during LEN contractions.", "pages": "83-6"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation coregistered with MRI: a comparison of a guided versus blind stimulation technique and its effect on evoked compound muscle action potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "11595135", "authors": ["Gugino, LD", "Romero, JR", "Aglio, L", "Titone, D", "Ramirez, M", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Grimson, E", "Weisenfeld, N", "Kikinis, R", "Shenton, ME"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are characterized by enormous variability, even when attempts are made to stimulate the same scalp location.

We show that magnetic stimulation (1 Hz, 10 min, 75% machine output/magstim 200 rapid stimulator) transiently enhanced c-fos 3-6 h after stimulation. Co-localization experiments revealed that c-fos was expressed in neurons but not astroglia. The activation of c-fos by magnetic stimulation was inhibited by the sodium-channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (10 microM). It is concluded that magnetic stimulation induces neuronal c-fos via TTX-sensitive sodium channels in organotypic cortex slices.", "pages": "83-6"}]
