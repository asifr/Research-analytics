Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the accessory nerve was recorded from the right trapezius. The accessory nerve was stimulated electrically at the C1 level, jugular tubercle and jugular foramen. The latencies of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) for each portion were measured and compared with the magnetic response, which was coincidental with that of the jugular tubercle. The accessory nerve was then transected in steps distally from the C1 level, and CMAPs following magnetic stimulation were recorded at each step. The CMAPs disappeared following the nerve transection at the jugular tubercle. The results of both approaches in this study conclude that transcranial magnetic stimulation excites the accessory nerve at jugular tubercle. This stimulation site was anatomically coincidental with that of the facial nerve and trigeminal nerve in being right before the point where the nerve bends. Following the accessory nerve transection at the C1 level, the amputation stump was moved cranially, and CMAPs disappeared. CMAPs recorded after the accessory nerve was returned to its original position. These examinations suggested that sudden alteration of the traveling lie of the nerve participates in the mechanism of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "363-7"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Hypoglossal nerve conduction study by transcranial magnetic stimulation in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "7700656", "authors": ["Campos, A", "Barona, R", "Escudero, J", "Montalt, J", "Escudero, M"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery", "abstract": "The introduction of transcranial magnetic stimulation has allowed the study of conduction in the proximal portions and central pathways of the cranial nerves.

Motor evoked potentials were constantly observed on cortical stimulation, in a painless, easy, and reproducible way, with mean values of 10.84 +/- 1.14 milliseconds (latency) and 7.81 +/- 1.14 mV (amplitude). Motor evoked potentials were unconstant and showed reduced amplitudes on cisternal stimulation, with mean values of 4.72 +/- 0.62 milliseconds and 0.83 +/- 1.26 mV. The magnetic stimulation technique allows the study of the entire motor pathway of cranial nerve XII (motor cortex-medulla, motoneuron-muscle).

All ALS patient units exhibited a response to the synchronized Ia volley indistinguishable from that of normal subjects, indicating that the investigated spinal motoneurons are capable of normal excitatory responses in ALS patients.

We compared this to the inhibitory effect of ipsilateral D2 stimulation on averaged rectified EMG recorded at 10% maximum voluntary contraction and on F-responses and H-reflexes recorded from these same muscles. We also compared MEPs recorded following D2 stimulation just above perception threshold to MEPs following higher intensity D2 stimulation. As well, we assessed the effect of preceding D2 stimulation on MEPs recorded from a relaxed versus tonically contracted hand muscle. D2 stimulation elicited a triphasic response of modest MEP facilitation followed by inhibition and further facilitation. The duration and onset of MEP inhibition correlated with those of the initial period of rectified EMG inhibition, however, the magnitude of MEP inhibition was generally less than the magnitude of EMG inhibition, consistent with a greater inhibitory effect of digital afferents on smaller motor neurons. MEPs were not facilitated during the rebound of EMG activity (the E2 period) that usually followed the initial period of EMG inhibition (I1 period). The behavior of H-reflexes and F-responses following ipsilateral D2 stimulation suggested that inhibition of both EMG and MEPs is not mediated via presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents, and that inhibition is augmented by descending rather than segmental input to spinal motor neurons. Tonic contraction of the target muscle during D2 stimulation decreased the inhibitory effect of the preceding digital stimulus possibly due to recruitment of larger spinal motor neurons less likely to be inhibited by cutaneous input.", "pages": "363-7"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Early and late motor evoked potentials reflect preset agonist-antagonist organization in lower limb muscles.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "7537203", "authors": ["Tarkka, IM", "McKay, WB", "Sherwood, AM", "Dimitrijevic, MR"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "A single transcranial magnetic stimulus can evoke two involuntary muscle responses in lower limb muscles of healthy humans. The purpose of the present study was to find out if these responses, when evoked during the processing period of a simple or choice reaction time task, such as ankle dorsiflexion, have specific characteristics related to the task. During the auditory reaction time, a transcranial magnetic stimulus was delivered to observe changes in the excitability of the central nervous system. A dual-cone coil was used, which effectively stimulated the fairly deep-lying lower limb motor cortex. Stimuli were delivered in a random order with 20-300-ms delays from the auditory go-signal. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) in right and left anterior tibial and soleus muscles were analyzed while early MEPs were observed invariably in both muscles; late MEPs occurred consistently only in soleus muscles. Both early and late MEP amplitudes were larger in simple reaction time trials than in choice reaction time trials. The late MEP appeared earlier in the simple reaction time task than in the choice reaction time task, reflecting faster central processing of simple reaction time tasks. The amplitude of the soleus late MEP in the simple reaction time task followed closely the amplitude of anterior tibial early MEP, suggesting a preset agonist-antagonist organization. This relationship was not present in the choice reaction time task.", "pages": "363-7"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "Increased corticomotoneuronal excitability after peripheral nerve stimulation in dopa-nonresponsive hemiparkinsonism.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "7870104", "authors": ["Yokota, T", "Saito, Y", "Shimizu, Y"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Corticomotoneuronal excitability was examined in 7 patients with dopa-nonresponsive progressive hemiparkinsonism (DNRHP) and 10 with dopa-responsive hemiparkinsonism (Parkinson's disease: PD), as well as in 10 normal subjects, by measuring change in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex after peripheral nerve stimulation. Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) was suspected clinically for the progressive dopa-nonresponsive hemiparkinsonism. Conditioning stimulation of the median nerve on the rigid side greatly increased MEP size (500-1300%) in 4 DNRHP patients as compared to the increase for the normal subjects (140-380%) at conditioning test (C-T) intervals of 40-80 ms, but stimulation on the contralateral side did not. There was no abnormal MEP facilitation on the rigid side in 10 PD patients. None of the patients with CBD had an increase in somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) size, and no patient showed hyperexcitability in SEP-recovery during C-T intervals at which there was abnormal MEP facilitation.

The study tested the hypothesis that cutaneous afferent stimulation, in the absence of muscle afferent input, facilitates the short latency MEPs evoked in lower limb muscles following transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex. Non-painful (3.6 x sensory threshold) percutaneous electrical stimulation was delivered to the sural nerve at conditioning (C)-test (T) intervals of 0-150 msec. MEPs were elicited bilaterally in the tibialis anterior (TA) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles with and without preceding cutaneous stimulation. Mean MEP amplitudes were facilitated in the ipsilateral TA by 258% (n = 10 of 11), the ipsilateral LG by 275% (n = 7 of 8) and the contralateral TA by 313% (n = 7 of 7) within C-T: 60-100 msec. These results establish that cutaneous afferent stimulation per se does lead to a facilitation of short latency MEPs. In addition, two subjects who were examined at higher stimulation intensities both exhibited late responses (70-95 msec) at C-T: 0-15 msec. These responses, which were independent of the amplitude and appearance of short latency MEPs, suggest a convergence of the cutaneous stimulation with late arriving descending cortical or cortico-bulbospinal inputs to the target motoneuron pool.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "363-7"}]
