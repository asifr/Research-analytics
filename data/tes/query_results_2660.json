Pattern 1 was focusing, in which, after initial recruitment of additional ipsilateral and contralateral areas, activation gradually developed toward a pattern of activation restricted to the contralateral sensorimotor cortex in 9 patients. Five patients were found to have pattern 2, persistent recruitment, in which there was an initial and sustained recruitment of ipsilateral activity. Occurrence of recruitment or focusing seemed to depend mainly on whether the primary motor cortex (M1) was lesioned; persistent recruitment was observed in 3 of 4 patients with M1 injury, and focusing was seen in 8 of 10 patients with spared M1. These patterns had no relation to the degree of recovery; in particular, focusing did not imply recovery. However, there was a clear relation between the degree of recovery and the degree of Wallerian degeneration.", "pages": "1610-7"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Motor disinhibition in affected and unaffected hemisphere in the early period of recovery after stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "12048054", "authors": ["Manganotti, P", "Patuzzo, S", "Cortese, F", "Palermo, A", "Smania, N", "Fiaschi, A"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "These results suggest that ipsilateral recruitment after stroke corresponds to a compensatory corticocortical process related to the lesion of the contralateral M1 and that the process of compensatory recruitment will persist if M1 is lesioned; otherwise, it will be transient.", "pages": "1610-7"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "High voltage electrical stimulation of the proximal hypoglossal nerve in normal subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "12048052", "authors": ["Inaba, A", "Yokota, T", "Otagiri, A", "Nishimura, T", "Saito, Y", "Kanouchi, T", "Mizusawa, H"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been tried therapeutically in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.
