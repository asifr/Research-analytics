Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) appears to reduce this pathological oscillation, thereby alleviating PD symptoms. However, direct stimulation of primary motor cortex (M1) has recently been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in PD, suggesting a role for cortex in patterning pathological rhythms. Here, we examine the properties of M1 network oscillations in coronal slices taken from rat brain. Oscillations in the high beta frequency range (layer 5, 27.8+/-1.1 Hz, n=6) were elicited by co-application of the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid (400 nM) and muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (50 microM). Dual extracellular recordings, local application of tetrodotoxin and recordings in M1 micro-sections indicate that the activity originates within deep layers V/VI. Beta oscillations were unaffected by specific AMPA receptor blockade, abolished by the GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)R) antagonist picrotoxin and the gap-junction blocker carbenoxolone, and modulated by pentobarbital and zolpidem indicating dependence on networks of GABAergic interneurons and electrical coupling. High frequency stimulation (HFS) at 125 Hz in superficial layers, designed to mimic transdural/transcranial stimulation, generated gamma oscillations in layers II and V (incidence 95%, 69.2+/-7.3 Hz, n=17) with very fast oscillatory components (VFO; 100-250 Hz). Stimulation at 4 Hz, however, preferentially promoted theta activity (incidence 62.5%, 5.1+/-0.6 Hz, n=15) that effected strong amplitude modulation of ongoing beta activity. Stimulation at 20 Hz evoked mixed theta and gamma responses. These data suggest that within M1, evoked theta, gamma and fast oscillations may coexist with and in some cases modulate pharmacologically induced beta oscillations.", "pages": "386-95"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "Efficient reduction of stimulus artefact in TMS-EEG by epithelial short-circuiting by mini-punctures.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18063410", "authors": ["Julkunen, P", "P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen, A", "Hukkanen, T", "K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, M", "Tiihonen, P", "Vanhatalo, S", "Karhu, J"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We aimed at comparing the effects of two different electrode-to-skin contact preparation techniques on the stimulus artefact induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in electroencephalography (EEG) signals.", "pages": "386-95"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "The clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation: report of an IFCN committee.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "18063409", "authors": ["Chen, R", "Cros, D", "Curra, A", "Di Lazzaro, V", "Lefaucheur, JP", "Magistris, MR", "Mills, K", "R\u00f6sler, KM", "Triggs, WJ", "Ugawa, Y", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Six healthy subjects participated in a combined navigated brain stimulation (NBS) and EEG study.

The central motor conduction time (CMCT) is a sensitive method to detect myelopathy and abnormalities may be detected in the absence of radiological changes. CMCT may also detect upper motor neuron involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The diagnostic sensitivity may be increased by using the triple stimulation technique (TST), by combining several parameters such as CMCT, motor threshold and silent period, or by studying multiple muscles. In peripheral facial nerve palsies, TMS may be used to localize the site of nerve dysfunction and clarify the etiology. TMS measures also have high sensitivity in detecting lesions in multiple sclerosis and abnormalities in CMCT or TST may correlate with motor impairment and disability. Cerebellar stimulation may detect lesions in the cerebellum or the cerebellar output pathway. TMS may detect upper motor neuron involvement in patients with atypical parkinsonism and equivocal signs. The ipsilateral silent period that measures transcallosal inhibition is a potential method to distinguish between different parkinsonian syndromes. Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which is related to central cholinergic transmission, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease. Changes in SAI following administration of cholinesterase inhibitor may be related to the long-term efficacy of this treatment. The results of MEP measurement in the first week after stroke correlate with functional outcome. We conclude that TMS measures have demonstrated diagnostic utility in myelopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. TMS measures have potential clinical utility in cerebellar disease, dementia, facial nerve disorders, movement disorders, stroke, epilepsy, migraine and chronic pain.", "pages": "386-95"}, {"volume": "99", "title": "Preconditioning repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of premotor cortex can reduce but not enhance short-term facilitation of primary motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "18057113", "authors": ["Suppa, A", "Bologna, M", "Gilio, F", "Lorenzano, C", "Rothwell, JC", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) causes changes in motor cortical excitability.
