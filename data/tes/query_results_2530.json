Seven healthy right-handed adults with no known neuromuscular disabilities performed an isometric voluntary wrist flexion at submaximum continuous exertion. After the subjects continued muscle contraction until volitional fatigue, the H-reflexes induced by an electric stimulation and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) from a flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle were recorded 7 times every 20 s. The H-reflex was used to assess excitability changes at the spinal level, and the MEP was used to study excitability changes at the cortical level. Hreflexes showed a depression (30% of control value) soon after the cessation of wrist flexion and recovered with time thereafter. On the other hand, an early (short latency) MEP showed facilitation immediately after the cessation of wrist flexion (50% of control value) and thereafter decreased. A possible mechanism for the contradictory results of the 2 tests, in spite of focusing on the same motoneuron pool, might be the different test potential sizes between them. In addition, a late (long latency) MEP response appeared with increasing exercise. With regard to the occurrence of late MEP response, a central mechanism may be proposed to explain the origin-that is, neural pathways with a high threshold that do not participate under normal circumstances might respond to an emergency level of muscle exercise, probably reflecting central effects of fatigue.", "pages": "30-4"}, {"volume": "337", "title": "Postural instability enhances motor responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10759179", "authors": ["Solopova, IA", "Kazennikov, OV", "Deniskina, NB", "Levik, YS", "Ivanenko, YP"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "As repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is often applied on different days, it is of interest to know whether motor (MT) and phosphene (PT) thresholds are reproducible across time and whether the intensity determined on the first day can be used in subsequent sessions.", "pages": "30-4"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "Modulation of transmission in the corticospinal and group ia afferent pathways to soleus motoneurons during bicycling.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "11459686", "authors": ["Pyndt, HS", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "We studied MT and PT over 5 separate recordings in 10 healthy volunteers using a focal coil and a Magstim(Rapid stimulator.

There was no effect of age on the resting threshold to TMS, the maximal amplitude of the MEP that could be evoked (MEP(max)) or the maximal slope of the stimulus-response curve. However, higher stimulus intensities were required to achieve both MEP(max) and the maximal slope in the older subjects. The trial-to-trial variability of MEPs was greater in the older subjects, particularly at intensities near threshold. There was a significant interaction between age, threshold and trial-to-trial variability of MEP amplitude. Overall, MEP variability fell markedly as stimulus intensity increased above threshold but less rapidly in older than in younger subjects. Females tended to have larger MEP variability than males, but age and threshold were much stronger modulators than sex. These differences in input-output characteristics are likely to be due either to a decreased number of spinal motoneurones being activated synchronously in older subjects, or to the activation of the same number of motoneurones in a less synchronous manner, leading to phase cancellation in the surface electromyogram.", "pages": "30-4"}]
