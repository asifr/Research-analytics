We hypothesized that a similar breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may underlie loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by pharmacologic agents. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing EEG responses to TMS during wakefulness and LOC induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam. Unlike spontaneous sleep states, a subject's level of vigilance can be monitored repeatedly during pharmacological LOC. We found that, unlike during wakefulness, wherein TMS triggered responses in multiple cortical areas lasting for >300 ms, during midazolam-induced LOC, TMS-evoked activity was local and of shorter duration. Furthermore, a measure of the propagation of evoked cortical currents (significant current scattering, SCS) could reliably discriminate between consciousness and LOC. These results resemble those observed in early NREM sleep and suggest that a breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may be a common feature of conditions characterized by LOC.

The present study investigated how healthy adults learn a continuous implicit motor task when somatosensation is altered by 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered over the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Twenty-seven right-handed participants enrolled in a two-part experiment. In Experiment 1, we verified that 20 min of 1 Hz rTMS over S1 disrupted cutaneous somatosensation (indexed by two-point discrimination) in the wrist/hand; the impact of 1 Hz rTMS on wrist proprioception (tested by limb-position matching) was variable. Sham rTMS had no effect on either measure. We exploited these effects in Experiment 2 by pairing either 1 Hz or sham rTMS with practice of a continuous tracking task over two separate sessions on different days. Implicit motor learning was indexed on a third, separate retention test day when no rTMS was delivered. Across practice in Experiment 2, both the 1 Hz and sham rTMS groups showed improved tracking performance; however, 1 Hz rTMS was associated with less accurate tracking and smaller improvements in performance. Importantly, at the no rTMS retention test the effects of altering sensation with stimulation over S1 were still evident in the persistently less accurate tracking behavior of the 1 Hz rTMS group.

Electrophysiological tremor parameters and also response to a cortical plasticity protocol using paired associative stimulation (PAS) was studied in 9 patients with SWEDDs, 9 with tremor-dominant PD (with abnormal dopamine transporter single photon emission computed tomography findings), 8 with segmental dystonia, and 8 with essential tremor (ET). Despite clinical overlap, lack of true bradykinesia, presence of dystonia, and head tremor favored a diagnosis of SWEDDs, whereas re-emergent tremor, true fatiguing or decrement, good response to dopaminergic drugs, and presence of non-motor symptoms favored PD. A single tremor parameter could not differentiate between groups, but the combination of re-emergent tremor and highest tremor amplitude at rest was characteristic of PD tremor. SWEDDs and segmental dystonia patients exhibited an abnormal exaggerated response to the PAS protocol, in contrast to a subnormal response in PD and a normal response in ET. We conclude that despite clinical overlap, there are features that can help to distinguish between PD and SWEDDs which may be useful in clinical practice.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether corticospinal drive plays a role in the control of arm muscle activity during human walking. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited in the posterior deltoid muscle (PD) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were modulated during the gait cycle in parallel with changes in the background EMG activity. There was no significant difference in the size of the MEPs at a comparable level of background EMG during walking and during static PD contraction. Short latency intracortical inhibition (SICI; 2 ms interval) studied by paired-pulse TMS was diminished during bursts of PD EMG activity. This could not be explained only by changes in background EMG activity and/or control MEP size, since SICI showed no correlation to the level of background EMG activity during static PD contraction. Finally, TMS at intensity below the threshold for activation of corticospinal tract fibres elicited a suppression of the PD EMG activity during walking. Since TMS at this intensity is likely to only activate intracortical inhibitory interneurones, the suppression is in all likelihood caused by removal of a corticospinal contribution to the ongoing EMG activity.

All of the patients were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In comparison with healthy subjects, both patient groups had significantly defective short intracortical inhibition (SICI), however LBD patients, but not ULD and healthy subjects, had a clear inhibition at ISI 6 ms and ISI 10 ms. Moreover, defective long interval cortical inhibition (LICI) was found in LBD but not ULD patients. The substantial reduction in SICI suggests that both ULD and LBD patients have impaired inhibitory interneuron pools which are involved in the generation of cortical reflex myoclonus, whereas the inhibition found in LBD patients at ISI 6 and 10 ms, as well the reduced inhibition found at long intervals, suggest a more complex circuitry dysfunction possibly involving both excitatory and inhibitory systems.

Our study involved 20 old healthy subjects (aged 72-84 years) known to have normal (n=10) or abnormal (n=10) SN echomorphology. All were in good health with no overt neurological signs. SN morphology was assessed with transcranial sonography through the pre-auricular bone window. Motor cortical excitability and intracortical inhibition were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the first dorsal interosseus motor area. Single stimuli were delivered during relaxation and voluntary contraction and paired stimuli were delivered during relaxation. Each cortical hemisphere was analysed separately. The response to single-pulse TMS (in motor cortex ipsilateral to the target SN) did not differ between groups. However, a significant difference between groups was observed in the paired pulse paradigm (conditioning stimulus intensity: 70% resting motor threshold; interstimulus interval: 2 ms). The conditioned motor evoked potential amplitude was significantly larger ipsilateral to the hyperechogenic SN than in controls (P=0.014). Thus, healthy subjects with SN hyperechogenicity exhibit significantly less intracortical inhibition within the motor cortex than subjects with normal echomorphology. Decreased intracortical inhibition is also observed in PD patients. This study provides further evidence that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy individuals is associated with changes characteristic of PD supporting a role for this feature as a vulnerability marker or state marker for subtle nigral dopaminergic dysfunction.", "pages": "1737-46"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Ultrasonic disruption of the blood-brain barrier enables in vivo functional mapping of the mouse barrel field cortex with manganese-enhanced MRI.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10191166", "authors": ["Howles, GP", "Qi, Y", "Johnson, GA"], "year": "2010", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "To investigate further the functional mechanisms underlying the so-called 'loss of psychic self-activation' following paramedian bithalamic lesions, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a patient who presented with this clinical picture after paramedian bithalamic infarction due to arterial occlusion.

To assess how the human brain controls utilitarian behavior, we delivered transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPC) and over the occipital cortex (OC) in 78 healthy subjects. Utilitarian judgment was assessed with the moral judgment task before and after tDCS. At baseline, females provided fewer utilitarian answers than males for personal moral dilemmas (p = .007). In males, VPC-tDCS failed to induce changes and in both genders OC-tDCS left utilitarian judgments unchanged.

In males and females, reaction times for utilitarian responses significantly decreased after cathodal (p<.001) but not after anodal (p = .735) VPC-tDCS. We conclude that ventral prefrontal tDCS interferes with utilitarian decisions, influencing the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each option in both sexes, but does so more strongly in females. Whereas cathodal tDCS alters the time for utilitarian reasoning in both sexes, anodal stimulation interferes more incisively in women, modifying utilitarian reasoning and the possible consequent actions.

Although study of these interactions has typically focused on their excitatory nature, given its strong connections with both ventral and opercular frontal regions, one feature of the influence of PMv over M1 may be inhibitory. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) was used to examine functional interactions between human PMv and M1 during the selection and reprogramming of a naturalistic goal-directed action. One of two cylinders was illuminated on each trial. It was then grasped and picked up. On some trials, however, subjects had to reprogram the action as the illuminated cylinder was switched off and the other illuminated simultaneously with reach initiation. At a neurophysiological level, the PMv paired-pulse effect (PPE) on M1 corticospinal activity was facilitatory after the initial target presentation and during movement initiation. When reprogramming was required, however, the PPE became strongly inhibitory. This context-dependent change from facilitation to inhibition occurred within 75 ms of the change of target. Behaviorally, PMv-M1 ppTMS disrupted reprogramming. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image scans were taken of each subject. Intersubject differences in the facilitation-inhibition contrast of PMv-M1 interactions were correlated with fractional anisotropy of white-matter in ventral prefrontal, premotor, and intraparietal brain areas.

One approach, Activation-Induced Manganese-enhanced MRI (AIM MRI), has been used successfully to map neuronal activity in rodents. In AIM MRI, manganese(2+) acts a calcium analog and accumulates in depolarized neurons. Because manganese(2+) shortens T1, regions of elevated neuronal activity enhance in MRI. However, because manganese does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the need to osmotically disrupt the BBB has limited the use of AIM MRI, particularly in mice. In this work, the BBB was opened in mice using unfocused, transcranial ultrasound in combination with gas-filled microbubbles. Using this noninvasive technique to open the BBB bilaterally, manganese could be quickly administered to the whole mouse brain. With this approach, AIM MRI was used to map the neuronal response to unilateral mechanical stimulation of the vibrissae in lightly sedated mice. The resultant 3D activation map agreed well with published representations of the vibrissae regions of the barrel field cortex. The anterior portions of the barrel field cortex corresponding to the more rostral vibrissae showed greater activation, consistent with previous literature. Because the ultrasonic opening of the BBB is simple, fast, and noninvasive, this approach is suitable for high-throughput and longitudinal studies in awake mice.

We used a conditioning-test transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm to test how PMv-M1 interactions [10-12] were modified by disrupting AIP function with theta-burst TMS (cTBS) [13]. At rest, AIP virtual lesions did not modify PMv-M1 interactions. In contrast, the usual muscle-specific PMv-M1 interactions that appeared during grasp preparation were significantly reduced following AIP cTBS without directly modifying corticospinal excitability. Behaviorally, disruption of AIP was also associated with a relative loss of the grasp-specific pattern of digit muscle activity.

A relatively new approach to this problem is to temporarily disrupt processing at specific cortical sites and measure the behavioural consequences. Several previous studies have shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of human visual area V5/MT disrupts global motion perception, but reports vary widely in the timescale of this effect. To resolve this issue we employed psychophysical techniques to investigate how discrimination of translational, rotational and radial global motion is affected by TMS. Prior to applying TMS we established baseline coherence thresholds for global motion perception. Adopting each observer's coherence level at threshold we examined how TMS delivered to V5/MT modulated performance. Importantly, we measured the influence of single-pulse TMS over a broad temporal range to reveal the fine temporal structure of the disruption profile for global motion perception. Results show that the disruption profile consisted of two distinct epochs during which global direction judgments were reliably impaired, separated by an interval in which performance was unaffected. The bimodal nature of the distribution profiles is consistent with feedforward and feedback processing between visual areas mediating global motion processing.

These hypotheses correspond to the two competing views of the neural genesis of awareness: the early, feedforward view and the late, recurrent feedback model. We combined online TMS and EEG recordings to investigate whether the electrophysiological correlates of conscious phosphene perception are detectable early after TMS onset as an immediate local effect of TMS, or only at longer latencies, after interactions of TMS-induced activity with other visual areas. Stimulation was applied at the intensity threshold at which participants saw a phosphene on half of the trials, and brain activity was recorded simultaneously with electroencephalography. Phosphene perception was associated with a differential pattern of TMS-evoked brain potentials that started 160-200 ms after stimulation and encompassed a wide array of posterior areas.

Here, we used double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess whether the contribution of this part of cortex is crucial for laying down new memories and, if so, to examine the time course of this process. Healthy adult volunteers performed an incidental encoding task (living/nonliving judgments) on sequences of words. In separate series, the task was performed either on its own or while TMS was applied to one of two sites of experimental interest (left/right anterior inferior frontal gyrus) or a control site (vertex). TMS pulses were delivered at 350, 750, or 1,150 ms following word onset. After a delay of 15 min, memory for the items was probed with a recognition memory test including confidence judgments. TMS to all three sites nonspecifically affected the speed and accuracy with which judgments were made during the encoding task. However, only TMS to prefrontal cortex affected later memory performance. Stimulation of left or right inferior frontal gyrus at all three time points reduced the likelihood that a word would later be recognized by a small, but significant, amount (approximately 4%). These findings indicate that bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex plays an essential role in memory formation, exerting its influence between > or = 350 and 1,150 ms after an event is encountered.", "pages": "1737-46"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Induction of semantic impairments using rTMS: evidence for the hub-and-spoke semantic theory.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "20123782", "authors": ["Banach, M", "Rakowicz, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Behavioural neurology", "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) presents major challenges for both patients and clinicians. There is no universally accepted definition of TRD, but results from the US National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) programme indicate that after the failure of two treatment trials, the chances of remission decrease significantly. Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for TRD may be considered when optimized (adequate dose and duration) therapy has not produced a successful outcome and a patient is classified as resistant to treatment. Nonpharmacological strategies include psychotherapy (often in conjunction with pharmacotherapy), electroconvulsive therapy and vagus nerve stimulation. The US FDA recently approved vagus nerve stimulation as adjunctive therapy (after four prior treatment failures); however, its benefits are seen only after prolonged (up to 1 year) use. Other nonpharmacological options, such as repetitive transcranial stimulation, deep brain stimulation or psychosurgery, remain experimental and are not widely available. Pharmacological treatments of TRD can be grouped in two main categories: 'switching' or 'combining'. In the first, treatment is switched within and between classes of compounds. The benefits of switching include avoidance of polypharmacy, a narrower range of treatment-emergent adverse events and lower costs. An inherent disadvantage of any switching strategy is that partial treatment responses resulting from the initial treatment might be lost by its discontinuation in favour of another medication trial. Monotherapy switches have also been shown to have limited effectiveness in achieving remission. The advantage of combination strategies is the potential to build upon achieved improvements; they are generally recommended if partial response was achieved with the current treatment trial. Various non-antidepressant augmenting agents, such as lithium and thyroid hormones, are well studied, although not commonly used. There is also evidence of efficacy and increasing use of atypical antipsychotics in combination with antidepressants, for example, olanzapine in combination with fluoxetine (OFC) or augmentation with aripiprazole. The disadvantages of a combination strategy include multiple medications, a broader range of treatment-emergent adverse events and higher costs. Several experimental pharmaceutical treatment alternatives for TRD are also being explored in combination with antidepressants or as monotherapy. These less studied alternative compounds include pindolol, inositol, CNS stimulants, hormones, herbal supplements, omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, folic acid, lamotrigine, modafinil, riluzole and topiramate. In summary, despite an increasing variety of choices for the treatment of TRD, this condition remains universally undefined and represents an area of unmet medical need. There are few known approved pharmacological agents for TRD (aripiprazole and OFC) and overall outcomes remain poor. This might be an indication that depression itself is a heterogeneous condition with a great diversity of pathologies, highlighting the need for careful evaluation of individuals with depressive symptoms who are unresponsive to treatment. Clearly, more research is needed to provide clinicians with better guidance in making those treatment decisions--especially in light of accumulating evidence that the longer patients are unsuccessfully treated, the worse their long-term prognosis tends to be.", "pages": "1737-46"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "The role of Posterior Parietal Cortex in spatial representation of time: a TMS study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10420021", "authors": ["Zyss, T", "Zieba, A", "Dudek, D", "Datka, W", "Siwek, M", "Wr\u00f3bel, A", "Grabski, B", "Maczka, G", "Brudkiewicz, P", "Wojnar, N", "\u0141aczyrska, M", "Borowiecka-Kluza, J", "Zygmuntowicz, M", "Pola\u0144ski, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Behavioural neurology", "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rats with Parkinson's disease. rTMS was given to rats with Parkinson's disease induced by 6-OHDA, daily for 4 weeks to examine the protective effects.
