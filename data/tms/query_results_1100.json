Although it is accepted that mirror mechanisms contribute to the occurrence of motor resonance (MR) and are common to action execution, observation, and imitation, questions remain about mirror (and MR) involvement in real social behavior and in processing nonhuman actions. To determine whether social interaction primes the MR system, groups of participants engaged or did not engage in a social interaction before observing human or robotic actions. During observation, MR was assessed via motor-evoked potentials elicited with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Compared with participants who did not engage in a prior social interaction, participants who engaged in the social interaction showed a significant increase in MR for human actions. In contrast, social interaction did not increase MR for robot actions. Thus, naturalistic social interaction and laboratory action observation tasks appear to involve common MR mechanisms, and recent experience tunes the system to particular agent types.", "pages": "5984-9"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation for tinnitus: no better than sham treatment?", "issue": "21", "pmid": "22539582", "authors": ["Triggs, WJ", "Hajioff, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "To test whether 4 weeks of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the temporal or temporoparietal cortex is effective and safe in the treatment of chronic tinnitus.", "pages": "5984-9"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Treatment of chronic tinnitus with \u03b8 burst stimulation: a randomized controlled trial.", "issue": "21", "pmid": "22539568", "authors": ["Plewnia, C", "Vonthein, R", "Wasserka, B", "Arfeller, C", "Naumann, A", "Schraven, SP", "Plontke, SK"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "In this controlled 3-armed trial, 48 patients with chronic tinnitus were treated with 4 weeks (20 sessions) of bilateral continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) at the T\u00fcbingen University Hospital.

Prevalence of phosphenes and PT values were assessed calculating mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CI). Ten trials (277 migraine patients and 193 controls) were included. Patients with MA had statistically significant lower PT compared with controls when a circular coil was used (MD -28.33; 95\u00a0% CI -36.09 to -20.58); a similar result was found in MwA patients (MD -17.12; 95\u00a0% CI -23.81 to -10.43); using a figure-of-eight coil the difference was not statistically significant.

First, TMS over SMA did not alter the corticospinal tract excitability measured by the size of motor evoked potential elicited by single-pulse TMS over M1. Next, we measured short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF), which reflects the function of a facilitatory circuit within M1, with or without a single-pulse TMS over SMA. When the intensity of the second pulse in the SICF paradigm (S2) was as weak as 1.0 active motor threshold for a hand muscle, SMA stimulation significantly enhanced the SICF.

Potential targets for upcoming therapies are then discussed in light of what is currently known about the physiopathology of pain in PD. Protocols for efficacy and safety assessment of novel analgesic therapies are discussed. Finally, critical aspects of study protocol design such as patient selection or outcomes to be evaluated are discussed.

The role of the DLPFC was analysed using an rTMS (repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation) paradigm that induced increased cortical activation of the left DLPFC. The subjects were required to perform a task that consisted of two experimental phases (i.e., an encoding and a recognition phase) in which the targets and the distractors were presented and recognition performance was measured. rTMS stimulation was provided over the left DLPFC during the recognition phase. We found that the rTMS stimulation affected the memory recognition of positive emotional material. Moreover, related and unrelated distractors were discarded better when they were positively valenced, and a more significant effect (i.e., increased performance) was produced in response to related distractors. This result suggests that the activation of the left DLPFC favours the memory recognition of positive emotional information, and that such activation is able to induce a more appropriate selective process to distinguish target from distractor stimuli in the presence of more complex processes (related distractors).

Here we used whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to map areas where S1(EYE)-rTMS affects the neural response evoked by retinally identical stimuli depending on the direction of rotation of the right eye. After S1(EYE)-rTMS, a single area in the left cuneus outside Brodmann Areas 17/18 showed an increased neuronal response to a right hemifield target when the right eye was rotated leftwards as compared with when it was rotated rightwards. This effect was larger after S1(EYE)-rTMS than after rTMS of a control area in the motor cortex. The neural response to retinally identical stimuli in this area could be predicted from the changes in visual detectability observed previously, but not from the location of the visual targets relative to the body. These results strongly argue for a modulatory connection from the eye proprioceptive area in the somatosensory cortex to the higher-order visual cortex.

The study presented here examined whether the context in which actions were observed revealed similar modulatory effects on corticospinal excitability. Eight human participants observed a baseline stimulus (a fixation cross), observed actions in order to attend to them, or observed the same actions with the intention to imitate them. Whereas motor evoked potentials elicited from the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the hand were facilitated by attending to actions, observing the same actions in an imitative capacity led to no facilitation effect. Furthermore, no motor facilitation effects occurred in a control muscle. Electromyographic data collected when participants physically imitated the observed actions revealed that the activity of the first dorsal interosseus muscle increased significantly during action execution compared with rest. These data suggest that an inhibitory mechanism acts on the corticospinal system to prevent the immediate overt imitation of observed actions.

We presented brief sounds and concurrently recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and/or probed visual cortex excitability (phosphene perception) through occipital transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In a first, TMS-only experiment, phosphene perception rate against time postsound showed a periodic pattern cycling at ~10 Hz phase-aligned to the sound. In a second, combined TMS-EEG experiment, TMS-trials reproduced the cyclical phosphene pattern and revealed a ~10 Hz pattern also for EEG-derived measures of occipital cortex reactivity to the TMS pulses. Crucially, EEG-data from intermingled trials without TMS established cross-modal phase-locking of occipitoparietal alpha oscillations. These independently recorded variables, i.e., occipital cortex excitability and reactivity and EEG phase dynamics, were significantly correlated.

The changes induced by rTMS on fMRI data varied with the baseline level of auditory cortex activation before rTMS. This baseline level of activation was itself related to the severity of tinnitus. Thus, cortical stimulation increased auditory cortex activation in patients who had less severe tinnitus and low level of activation before rTMS, whereas it decreased auditory cortex activation in patients who had more severe tinnitus and higher level of activation before rTMS. Regarding AEPs, rTMS decreased N1 amplitude in all patients, except in the patient who had the most severe tinnitus at baseline and showed no improvement after rTMS.

However, the effects of TBS on neuronal oscillations remain unclear. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate changes of neuronal oscillations after continuous TBS (cTBS), the protocol that emulates long-term depression (LTD) form of synaptic plasticity. We randomly divided 26 healthy humans into two groups receiving either Active or Sham cTBS as control over the left primary motor cortex (M1). Post-cTBS aftereffects were assessed with behavioural measurements at rest using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and at active state during the execution of a choice reaction time (RT) task in combination with continuous electrophysiological recordings. The cTBS-induced EEG oscillations were assessed using event-related power (ERPow), which reflected regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies of \u03b8 (4-7.5 Hz), low \u03b1 (8-9.5 Hz), \u00b5 (10-12.5 Hz), low \u03b2 (13-19.5 Hz), and high \u03b2 (20-30 Hz) brain rhythms. Results revealed 20-min suppression of MEPs and at least 30-min increase of ERPow modulation, suggesting that besides MEPs, EEG has the potential to provide an accurate cortical readout to assess cortical excitability and to investigate the interference of cortical oscillations in the human brain post-cTBS. We also observed a predominant modulation of \u03b2 frequency band, supporting the hypothesis that cTBS acts more on cortical level. Theta oscillations were also modulated during rest implying the involvement of independent cortical theta generators over the motor network post cTBS. This work provided more insights into the underlying mechanisms of cTBS, providing a possible link between synchronised neural oscillations and LTD in humans.", "pages": "5984-9"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Are there excitability changes in the hand motor cortex during speech in left-handed subjects?", "issue": "3", "pmid": "11940694", "authors": ["Tokimura, H", "Tokimura, Y", "Arita, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "abstract": "Probing brain functions by brain stimulation while simultaneously recording brain activity allows addressing major issues in cognitive neuroscience. We review recent studies where electroencephalography (EEG) has been combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in order to investigate possible neuronal substrates of visual perception and attention. TMS-EEG has been used to study both pre-stimulus brain activity patterns that affect upcoming perception, and also the stimulus-evoked and task-related inter-regional interactions within the extended visual-attentional network from which attention and perception emerge. Local processes in visual areas have been probed by directly stimulating occipital cortex while monitoring EEG activity and perception. Interactions within the attention network have been probed by concurrently stimulating frontal or parietal areas. The use of tasks manipulating implicit and explicit memory has revealed in addition a role for attentional processes in memory. Taken together, these studies helped to reveal that visual selection relies on spontaneous intrinsic activity in visual cortex prior to the incoming stimulus, their control by attention, and post-stimulus processes incorporating a re-entrant bias from frontal and parietal areas that depends on\u00a0the task.", "pages": "5984-9"}]
