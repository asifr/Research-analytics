The objective of this study is to define the pathways involved in transcallosal inhibition by examining patients with infarctions in different subregions of the CC. We hypothesized that patients with lesions in the posterior one-half of the CC would have greater reduction in transcallosal inhibition between the motor cortices. Twenty-six patients with callosal infarction and 14 healthy subjects were studied. The callosal lesions were localized on sagittal MRI and were attributed to one of five segments of the CC. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess ipsilateral silent period (iSP) and short- and long-latency interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI and LIHI, respectively) originating from both motor cortices. The results showed that the iSP areas and durations were markedly reduced bilaterally in patients with callosal infarction compared with normal subjects. Patients with callosal infarctions also had less IHI bidirectionally compared with normal subjects. iSP areas and durations were lower in patients with lesions than in patients without lesions in segment 3 (posterior midbody) of the CC. Lesion burden in the posterior one-half of the CC negatively correlated transcallosal inhibition measured with iSP and SIHI. Our study suggests that callosal infarction led to reduced transcallosal inhibition, as measured by iSP, SIHI, and LIHI.

Metal implants are subject to magnetic forces due to fast alternating magnetic fields produced by the TMS coil. The question of whether the mechanical movement of the implants leads to irreversible damage of brain tissue is addressed by an electromagnetic simulation which quantifies the magnitude of imposed magnetic forces. The assessment is followed by a careful mechanical analysis determining the maximum tolerable force which does not cause irreversible tissue damage. Results of this investigation provide useful information on the range of TMS stimulator output powers which can be safely used in patients having metallic implants. It is shown that conventional TMS applications can be considered safe when applied on patients with typical electrode implants as the induced stress in the brain tissue remains well below the limit of tissue damage.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Rapid effect of nicotine intake on neuroplasticity in non-smoking humans.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23133419", "authors": ["Grundey, J", "Thirugnanasambandam, N", "Kaminsky, K", "Drees, A", "Skwirba, AC", "Lang, N", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "abstract": "In various studies nicotine has shown to alter cognitive functions in non-smoking subjects. The physiological basis for these effects might be nicotine-generated modulation of cortical structure, excitability, and activity, as mainly described in animal experiments. In accordance, a recently conducted study demonstrated that application of nicotine for hours via nicotine patch in non-smoking humans alters the effects of neuroplasticity-inducing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques on cortical excitability. Specifically, nicotine abolished inhibitory plasticity independent from the focality of the stimulation protocol. While nicotine prevented also the establishment of non-focal facilitatory plasticity, focal synapse-specific facilitatory plasticity was enhanced. These results agree with a focusing effect of prolonged nicotine application on facilitatory plasticity. However, since nicotine induces rapid adaption processes of its receptors, this scenario might differ from the effect of nicotine in cigarette smoking. Thus in this study we aimed to gain further insight in the mechanism of nicotine on plasticity by exploring the effect of nicotine spray on non-focal and focal plasticity-inducing protocols in non-smoking subjects, a fast-acting agent better comparable to cigarette smoking. Focal, synapse-specific plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), while non-focal plasticity was elicited by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Forty eight non-smokers received nicotine spray respectively placebo combined with one of the following protocols (anodal tDCS, cathodal tDCS, PAS-25, and PAS-10). Corticospinal excitability was monitored via motor-evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Nicotine spray abolished facilitatory plasticity irrespective of focality and PAS-10-induced excitability diminution, while tDCS-derived excitability reduction was delayed and weakened. Nicotine spray had thus a clear effect on neuroplasticity in non-smoking subjects. However, the effects of nicotine spray differ clearly from those of prolonged nicotine application, which might be due to missing adaptive nicotinic receptor alterations. These results enhance our knowledge about the dynamic impact of nicotine on plasticity, which might be related to its heterogenous effect on cognition.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in tinnitus patients: a systemic review and meta-analysis.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1410169", "authors": ["Song, JJ", "Vanneste, S", "Van de Heyning, P", "De Ridder, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "TheScientificWorldJournal", "abstract": "Although transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has already been used to manage tinnitus patients, paucity of reports and variations in protocols preclude a comprehensive understanding.

A total of 17 studies were identified and 6 of them were included in the systemic review and 2 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Overall 39.5% responded to active tDCS with a mean tinnitus intensity reduction of 13.5%. Additionally, left temporal area (LTA) and bifrontal tDCS indicated comparable results. Active tDCS was found to be more effective than sham tDCS for tinnitus intensity reduction (Hedges' g = .77, 95% confidence interval 0.23-1.31). The efficacy of tDCS in tinnitus could not be fully confirmed by the current study because of the limited number of studies, but all studies included in the current systemic review and meta-analysis demonstrated significant tinnitus intensity improvement.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been extensively used in recent years to investigate modifications within the brain during and after fatiguing exercise. Single-pulse TMS reveals reduction in motor-evoked potentials (MEP) when measured in relaxed muscle following sustained fatiguing contractions. This modulation of corticospinal excitability observed in relaxed muscle is probably not specific to the fatigue induced by the motor task. During maximal and submaximal fatiguing contractions, voluntary activation measured by TMS decreases, suggesting the presence of supraspinal fatigue. The demonstration of supraspinal fatigue does not eliminate the possibility of spinal contribution to central fatigue. Concomitant measurement of TMS-induced MEP and cervicomedullary MEP in the contracting muscle, appropriately normalized to maximal muscle compound action potential, is necessary to determine the relative contribution of cortical and spinal mechanisms in the development of central fatigue. Recent studies comparing electromyographic (EMG) responses to paired-pulse stimuli at the cortical and subcortical levels suggest that impaired motoneuron responsiveness rather than intracortical inhibition may contribute to the development of central fatigue. This review examines the mechanical and EMG responses elicited by TMS (single- and paired-pulse) and cervicomedullary stimulation both during and after a fatiguing exercise. Particular attention is given to the muscle state and the type of fatiguing exercise when assessing and interpreting fatigue-induced changes in these parameters.

The distribution of the induced electric field in realistic anatomies can be modelled using computational methods. However, existing computational methods for accurately determining the induced electric field in realistic anatomical models have suffered from long computation times, typically in the range of tens of minutes or longer. This paper presents a matrix-free implementation of the finite-element method with a geometric multigrid method that can potentially reduce the computation time to several seconds or less even when using an ordinary computer. The performance of the method is studied by computing the induced electric field in two anatomically realistic models. An idealized two-loop coil is used as the stimulating coil. Multiple computational grid resolutions ranging from 2 to 0.25\u00a0mm are used. The results show that, for macroscopic modelling of the electric field in an anatomically realistic model, computational grid resolutions of 1\u00a0mm or 2\u00a0mm appear to provide good numerical accuracy compared to higher resolutions. The multigrid iteration typically converges in less than ten iterations independent of the grid resolution. Even without parallelization, each iteration takes about 1.0\u00a0s or 0.1\u00a0s for the 1 and 2\u00a0mm resolutions, respectively.

Recently, neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has been established as an alternative approach. We here compared the test-retest reliability of both mapping techniques with regard to the cortical representations of the hand, leg, face and tongue areas. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were examined three times (intervals: 3-5days/21-35days) with fMRI and nTMS. Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis, plantaris, mentalis and the tongue muscles. The same muscles were activated in an fMRI motor task. Euclidean distances (ED) between hotspots and centers of gravity (CoG) were computed for the respective somatotopic representations. Furthermore, spatial reliability was tested by intersession overlap volumes (OV) and voxel-wise intraclass correlations (ICC). RESULTS: Feasibility of fMRI was 100% for all body parts and sessions. In contrast, nTMS was feasible in all sessions and subjects only for the hand area, while mappings of the foot (90%), face (70%) and tongue representations (40%) remained incomplete in several subjects due to technical constraints and co-stimulation artifacts. On average, the mean ED of the hotspots was better for fMRI (6.2\u00b11.1mm) compared to nTMS (10.8\u00b11.9mm) while stability of CoG was similar for both methods. Peak voxel reliability (ICC) was high for both methods (>0.8), and there was no influence of inter-session intervals. In contrast, the reliability of mapping the spatial extent of the hand, foot, lips and tongue representations was poor to moderate for both fMRI and nTMS (OVs and ICC<50%). Especially nTMS mappings of the face and tongue areas yielded poor reliability estimates. CONCLUSION: Both methods are highly reliable when mapping the core region of a given target muscle, especially for the hand representation area. In contrast, mapping the spatial extent of a cortical representation area was only little reliable for both nTMS and fMRI. In summary, fMRI was better suited when mapping motor representations of the head, while nTMS showed equal reliability for mapping the hand and foot representation areas. Hence, both methods may well complement each other.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation for preoperative language mapping in a patient with a left frontoopercular glioblastoma.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16220335", "authors": ["Sollmann, N", "Picht, T", "M\u00e4kel\u00e4, JP", "Meyer, B", "Ringel, F", "Krieg, SM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Spine surgery carries an inherent risk of damage to critical neural structures.

In the current study, we used low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine whether the PPC and DLPFC both normally facilitate selection of gains and losses with better long-term value than alternatives during intertemporal choice. We found that disruption of either region in the right hemisphere led to greater selection of both gains and losses that had better immediate, but worse long-term value than alternatives.

In 30 participants, we measured motor threshold (MT) and phosphene threshold (PT) at the scalp surface and at coil-scalp distances of 3.17, 5.63, and 9.03 mm. We also modeled the effect of TMS in a simple head model to test the effect of distance. Four independent tests confirmed a significant correlation between PT and MT.

These inhibitory mechanisms are mediated by direct transcallosal projections located in the posterior portions of the corpus callosum. The current study, using diffusion imaging and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), aims at assessing, in a data-driven fashion, the contribution of structural disconnection between hemispheres in determining the presence and severity of neglect. Eleven patients with right acute stroke and 11 healthy matched controls underwent MRI at 3T, including diffusion imaging, and T1-weighted volumes. TBSS was modified to account for the presence of the lesion and used to assess the presence and extension of changes in diffusion indices of microscopic white matter integrity in the left hemisphere of patients compared to controls, and to investigate, by correlation analysis, whether this damage might account for the presence and severity of patients' neglect, as assessed by the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT). None of the patients had any macroscopic abnormality in the left hemisphere; however, 3 cases were discarded due to image artefacts in the MRI data. Conversely, TBSS analysis revealed widespread changes in diffusion indices in most of their left hemisphere tracts, with a predominant involvement of the corpus callosum and its projections on the parietal white matter. A region of association between patients' scores at BIT and brain FA values was found in the posterior part of the corpus callosum.

So far there are only a few investigations directly aimed at identifying the neural structures dedicated to this process. In the present study, we applied double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the parietal opercula to further investigate the role of these regions in coding imitative compatibility. We found that a temporary disruption of parietal opercula caused the reduction of the imitative compatibility relative to the sham condition.

Our results reveal reduced negative tap-to-pacer asynchronies following rTMS of the left PPC in all pacing conditions. This effect lasted for about 5 min after cessation of rTMS. Right PPC and visual cortex stimulation did not yield any significant behavioural effects. Since suppression of left PPC modified right-hand synchronization accuracy independent of the pacing signal's modality, the present data support the significance of left PPC for anticipatory motor control over a primary role in multisensory integration. The present data suggest that 1 Hz rTMS might interrupt a matching process of anticipated and real sensorimotor feedback within PPC.

Initial peak rate of relaxation was slower for the old men than for the young men, and was associated with a longer time to failure for both tasks (P<0.05). Low initial power during elbow flexion was associated with the greatest difference (reduction) in time to failure between the isometric task and the dynamic task (r=-0.54, P=0.015). SIT declined after both fatigue tasks similarly with age, although the recovery of SIT was associated with MVIC recovery for the old (both sessions) but not for the young men. Biceps brachii and brachioradialis EMG activity (% MVIC) of the old men were greater than that of the young men during the dynamic fatiguing task (P<0.05), but were similar during the isometric task.

However, it remains unclear whether EEG inhibition reflects similar mechanisms to MEP inhibition. Eight healthy participants received single- and paired-pulse TMS (ISI = 100 ms) over the motor cortex. MEPs were measured from a small hand muscle (first dorsal interosseus), whereas early (P30, P60) and late (N100) TMS-evoked cortical potentials (TEPs) were measured over the motor cortex using EEG. Conditioning and test TMS intensities were altered, and modulation of LICI strength was measured using both methods. LICI of MEPs and both P30 and P60 TEPs increased in strength with increasing conditioning intensities and decreased with increasing test intensities. LICI of N100 TEPs remained unchanged across all conditions. In addition, MEP and P30 LICI strength correlated with the slope of the N100 evoked by the conditioning pulse. LICI of early and late TEP components was differentially modulated with altered TMS intensities, suggesting independent underlying mechanisms. LICI of P30 is consistent with inhibition of cortical excitation similar to MEPs, whereas LICI of N100 may reflect presynaptic autoinhibition of inhibitory interneurons.

Twenty-six participants answered autobiographical questions truthfully or deceptively before and after sham and real cTBS. Deception was reliably associated with more errors, longer and more variable response times than truth telling. Despite the potential role of IFS in deception as suggested by neuroimaging data, the cTBS-induced disruption of right IFS did not affect response times or error rates, when compared to sham stimulation. The present findings do not support the hypothesis that the right IFS is critically involved in deception.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Unmasking the contribution of low-level features to the guidance of attention.", "issue": "14", "pmid": "21320389", "authors": ["Ossand\u00f3n, JP", "Onat, S", "Cazzoli, D", "Nyffeler, T", "M\u00fcri, R", "K\u00f6nig, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Humans are adept at switching between goal-directed behaviors quickly and effectively. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play a critical role by encoding, updating, and maintaining internal representations of task context in working memory. It has also been hypothesized that the encoding of context representations in PFC is regulated by phasic dopamine gating signals. Here we use multimodal methods to test these hypotheses. First we used functional MRI (fMRI) to identify regions of PFC associated with the representation of context in a working memory task. Next we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), guided spatially by our fMRI findings and temporally by previous event-related EEG recordings, to disrupt context encoding while participants performed the same working memory task. We found that TMS pulses to the right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) immediately after context presentation, and well in advance of the response, adversely impacted context-dependent relative to context-independent responses. This finding causally implicates right DLPFC function in context encoding. Finally, using the same paradigm, we conducted high-resolution fMRI measurements in brainstem dopaminergic nuclei (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra) and found phasic responses after presentation of context stimuli relative to other stimuli, consistent with the timing of a gating signal that regulates the encoding of representations in PFC. Furthermore, these responses were positively correlated with behavior, as well as with responses in the same region of right DLPFC targeted in the TMS experiment, lending support to the hypothesis that dopamine phasic signals regulate encoding, and thereby the updating, of context representations in PFC.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "136", "title": "Magnetic flimmers: 'light in the electromagnetic darkness'.", "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "21336139", "authors": ["Martens, JW", "Koehler, PJ", "Vijselaar, J"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human cerebral cortex modulates cortical excitability non-invasively in a polarity-specific manner: anodal tDCS leads to lasting facilitation of motor cortex excitability.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "", "title": "A Role for the Parietal Cortex in Sensorimotor Adaptation of Saccades.", "issue": "", "pmid": "21509429", "authors": ["Panouill\u00e8res, M", "Habchi, O", "Gerardin, P", "Salemme, R", "Urquizar, C", "Farne, A", "P\u00e9lisson, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "To further elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms of tDCS.", "pages": "659-65"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Disrupted Cortical Conductivity in Schizophrenia: TMS-EEG Study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22215866", "authors": ["Frantseva, M", "Cui, J", "Farzan, F", "Chinta, LV", "Perez Velazquez, JL", "Daskalakis, ZJ"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "We recorded corticospinal volleys evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex before and after a 20 min period of anodal tDCS in a conscious patient who had electrode implanted in the cervical epidural space for the control of pain.
