One core cognitive deficit is impaired working memory (WM) suggesting malfunctioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to transiently facilitate or consolidate neuronal processes. Pilot studies using rTMS have demonstrated improvement of psychopathology in other psychiatric disorders, but a systematic investigation of working memory effects outlasting the stimulation procedure has not been performed so far. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of a 3-week high frequency active or sham 10 Hz rTMS on cognition, specifically on working memory, in schizophrenia patients (n=25) in addition to antipsychotic therapy and in healthy controls (n=22). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activation patterns during verbal WM (letter 2-back task) before and after 3-weeks treatment with rTMS. Additionally, other cognitive tasks were conducted. 10 Hz rTMS was applied over the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (EEG electrode location F3) with an intensity of 110% of the individual resting motor threshold (RMT) over a total of 15 sessions. Participants recruited the common fronto- parietal and subcortical WM network. Multiple regression analyses revealed no significant activation differences over time in any contrast or sample. According to the ANOVAs for repeated measures performance remained without alterations in all groups.

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to quantify motor unit synchrony in a variety of human muscles differing in the presumed extent of cortical input to their respective motor nuclei. Cross-correlation histograms were generated from the firing times of 551 pairs of motor units in 16 human muscles. Motor unit synchrony tended to be weakest for proximal muscles and strongest for more distal muscles. Previous work in monkeys and humans has shown that the strength of cortical inputs to motor neurons also exhibits a similar proximal-to-distal gradient. However, in the present study, proximal-distal location was not an exclusive predictor of synchrony magnitude. The muscle that exhibited the least synchrony was an elbow flexor, whereas the greatest synchrony was most often found in intrinsic foot muscles. Furthermore, the strength of corticospinal inputs to the abductor hallucis muscle, an intrinsic foot muscle, as assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation, was weaker than that projecting to the tibialis anterior muscle, even though the abductor hallucis muscle had higher synchrony values compared with the tibialis anterior muscle. We argue, therefore, that factors other than the potency of cortical inputs to motor neurons, such as the number of motor neurons innervating a muscle, significantly affects motor unit synchrony.", "pages": "300-7"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Effects of individual alpha rTMS applied to the auditory cortex and its implications for the treatment of chronic tinnitus.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19555291", "authors": ["Weisz, N", "L\u00fcchinger, C", "Thut, G", "M\u00fcller, N"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "In this study we investigated the effects of aging on corticospinal tract conduction by measuring the corticoconus motor conduction time (CCCT).", "pages": "300-7"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Age-related differences in corticospinal excitability during a choice reaction time task.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17254833", "authors": ["Cuypers, K", "Thijs, H", "Duque, J", "Swinnen, SP", "Levin, O", "Meesen, RL"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right tibialis anterior muscle in 100 healthy volunteers.

The main obstacle for widespread use of ECM in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the cost of computing and storing the connectivity matrix. This article presents fast ECM (fECM), an efficient algorithm to estimate voxel-wise eigenvector centralities from fMRI time series. Instead of explicitly storing the connectivity matrix, fECM computes matrix-vector products directly from the data, achieving high accelerations for computing voxel-wise centralities in fMRI at standard resolutions for multivariate analyses, and enabling high-resolution analyses performed on standard hardware. We demonstrate the validity of fECM at cluster and voxel levels, using synthetic and in vivo data. Results from synthetic data are compared to the theoretical gold standard, and local centrality changes in fMRI data are measured after experimental intervention. A simple scheme is presented to generate time series with prescribed covariances that represent a connectivity matrix. These time series are used to construct a 4D dataset whose volumes consist of separate regions with known intra- and inter-regional connectivities. The fECM method is tested and validated on these synthetic data. Resting-state fMRI data acquired after real-versus-sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation show fECM connectivity changes in resting-state network regions. A comparison of analyses with and without accounting for motion parameters demonstrates a moderate effect of these parameters on the centrality estimates.

One of the criticisms against tDCS is the lack of spatial specificity. Focality is limited by the electrode size (35\u2009cm(2) are commonly used) and the bipolar arrangement. However, a current flow through the head directly from anode to cathode is an outdated view. Finite-element (FE) models have recently been used to predict the exact current flow during tDCS.

To face the challenge to predict the location, magnitude, and direction of the current flow induced by tDCS and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), we used a refined realistic FE modeling approach. With respect to the literature on clinical tDCS and tACS, we analyzed two common setups for the location of the stimulation electrodes which target the frontal lobe and the occipital lobe, respectively. We compared lateral and medial electrode configuration with regard to their usability. We were able to demonstrate that the lateral configurations yielded more focused stimulation areas as well as higher current intensities in the target areas.

Several studies show that endogenous brain rhythms may be enhanced via diverse brain stimulation techniques applying rhythmic stimulation. Here, we investigated in normal hearing participants whether application of rTMS (left auditory cortex) with an individualized alpha frequency was capable of increasing alpha activity in stimulated auditory regions in a sustained manner. Behavioral intensity discrimination performance worsened for the rTMS group as compared to Sham. Electroencephalography (EEG) data, however, clearly show that this functional inhibition is not accompanied by increases of auditory cortical alpha. Even though more pronounced power reductions for the rTMS group were observed at slower frequencies (delta to theta range) at stimulated and other sites of the left hemisphere, they were unrelated to behavioral changes. Our results also strongly suggest that the amount of power modulations at these slower frequencies is strongly dependent on pre-rTMS power, thus supporting current state-dependency notions. Strong relationships to behavioral changes were in particular observed for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) beta power and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) beta connectivity. Moreover, these beta band measures were strongly inter-related and when viewed together specifically sensitive to behavioral changes in the rTMS group. We conclude that currently alpha frequency rTMS is not a promising avenue for the treatment of chronic tinnitus and that beneficial effects could be mediated via nonauditory systems.

However, despite considerable recent progress, the functional properties and lateralization of the human auditory cortex are far from being fully understood. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can transiently or lastingly modulate cortical excitability via the application of localized magnetic field pulses, and represents a unique method of exploring plasticity and connectivity. It has only recently begun to be applied to understand auditory cortical function. An important issue in using TMS is that the physiological consequences of the stimulation are difficult to establish. Although many TMS studies make the implicit assumption that the area targeted by the coil is the area affected, this need not be the case, particularly for complex cognitive functions which depend on interactions across many brain regions. One solution to this problem is to combine TMS with functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The idea here is that fMRI will provide an index of changes in brain activity associated with TMS. Thus, fMRI would give an independent means of assessing which areas are affected by TMS and how they are modulated. In addition, fMRI allows the assessment of functional connectivity, which represents a measure of the temporal coupling between distant regions. It can thus be useful not only to measure the net activity modulation induced by TMS in given locations, but also the degree to which the network properties are affected by TMS, via any observed changes in functional connectivity. Different approaches exist to combine TMS and functional imaging according to the temporal order of the methods. Functional MRI can be applied before, during, after, or both before and after TMS. Recently, some studies interleaved TMS and fMRI in order to provide online mapping of the functional changes induced by TMS. However, this online combination has many technical problems, including the static artifacts resulting from the presence of the TMS coil in the scanner room, or the effects of TMS pulses on the process of MR image formation. But more importantly, the loud acoustic noise induced by TMS (increased compared with standard use because of the resonance of the scanner bore) and the increased TMS coil vibrations (caused by the strong mechanical forces due to the static magnetic field of the MR scanner) constitute a crucial problem when studying auditory processing. This is one reason why fMRI was carried out before and after TMS in the present study. Similar approaches have been used to target the motor cortex, premotor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and language-related areas, but so far no combined TMS-fMRI study has investigated the auditory cortex. The purpose of this article is to provide details concerning the protocol and considerations necessary to successfully combine these two neuroscientific tools to investigate auditory processing. Previously we showed that repetitive TMS (rTMS) at high and low frequencies (resp. 10 Hz and 1 Hz) applied over the auditory cortex modulated response time (RT) in a melody discrimination task. We also showed that RT modulation was correlated with functional connectivity in the auditory network assessed using fMRI: the higher the functional connectivity between left and right auditory cortices during task performance, the higher the facilitatory effect (i.e. decreased RT) observed with rTMS. However those findings were mainly correlational, as fMRI was performed before rTMS.

Such lesions produce an important reorganization of speech/language-specific brain networks due to an imbalance between cortical facilitation and inhibition. In fact, functional recovery is associated with changes in the excitability of the damaged neural structures and their connections. Two main mechanisms are involved in poststroke aphasia recovery: the recruitment of perilesional regions of the left hemisphere in case of small lesion and the acquisition of language processing ability in homotopic areas of the nondominant right hemisphere when left hemispheric language abilities are permanently lost. There is some evidence that noninvasive cortical stimulation, especially when combined with language therapy or other therapeutic approaches, can promote aphasia recovery. Cortical stimulation was mainly used to either increase perilesional excitability or reduce contralesional activity based on the concept of reciprocal inhibition and maladaptive plasticity.

This paper reviews the rationale for using the different NICS modalities to promote motor stroke rehabilitation. The changes in cortical excitability after stroke and the possible mechanisms of action of cortical stimulation in this context are outlined. A number of open and placebo-controlled trials have investigated the clinical effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor cortex in patients with motor stroke. These studies attempted to improve motor performance by increasing cortical excitability in the stroke-affected hemisphere (via high-frequency rTMS or anodal tDCS) or by decreasing cortical excitability in the contralateral hemisphere (via low-frequency rTMS or cathodal tDCS). The goal of these studies was to reduce the inhibition exerted by the unaffected hemisphere on the affected hemisphere and to then restore a normal balance of interhemispheric inhibition. All these NICS techniques administered alone or in combination with various methods of neurorehabilitation were found to be safe and equally effective at the short term on various aspects of poststroke motor abilities.

Conversely, in AD patients the facilitatory pattern of parieto-motor connections was evident only when TMS was delivered at an intensity of 110% of RMT with a peak at ISI = 8 ms. Moreover in AD patients, treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors did not induce any significant modification in the strength of the connection. In subsequent analyses, we found that, in AD patients, the effects induced by PPC conditioning at 110% RMT correlated with neuropsychological measures of episodic memory and executive functions, implying that patients with better cognitive performance had less impaired connectivity.

Despite such effort, an easily accessible benchmark head model is greatly needed when individualized modeling is either undesired (to observe general population trends as opposed to individual differences) or unfeasible. Here, we derive a closed-form linear system which relates the applied current to the induced electric potential. It is shown that in the spherical harmonic (Fourier) domain, a simple scalar multiplication relates the current density on the scalp to the electric potential in the brain. Equivalently, the current density in the head follows as the spherical convolution between the scalp current distribution and the point spread function of the head, which we derive. Thus, if one knows the spherical harmonic representation of the scalp current (i.e. the electrode locations and current intensity to be employed), one can easily compute the resulting electric field at any point inside the head. Conversely, one may also readily determine the scalp current distribution required to generate an arbitrary electric field in the brain (the 'backward problem' in tCS).

For two stimulation coils, we determined the characteristics of their field in air. We then measured motor thresholds for the abductor hallucis muscle of 10 healthy subjects. Coil position, distance from the scalp, and orientation were controlled with a head tracking robotic system that corrected for head movements. In both coils an approximately exponential increase, rather than a linear increase, of the threshold with the scalp-coil distance was measured. The slope of the increase was slightly smaller than expected from the field characteristic, but overall in good agreement. With respect to the depth of the TMS target, different results were obtained from the threshold ratios of the coils and from the slopes of the threshold increase with distance. For the adjustment of stimulator output to scalp-to-cortex distances exponential functions with parameters motivated by physical properties of the coils should be used.

How NMES affects circuits interposed between the ascending afferent volley and descending CS pathways is not known. Presently, we hypothesized that short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) would be reduced and afferent facilitation (AF) enhanced when NMES increased CS excitability. NMES was delivered for 40 min over the ulnar nerve. To assess CS excitability, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were evoked using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered at 120% resting threshold for first dorsal interosseus muscle. These MEPs increased by \u223c1.7-fold following NMES, demonstrating enhanced CS excitability. SAI and AF were tested by delivering a \"conditioning\" electrical stimulus to the ulnar nerve 18-25 ms and 28-35 ms before a \"test\" TMS pulse, respectively. Conditioned MEPs were compared to unconditioned MEPs evoked in the same trials. TMS was adjusted so unconditioned MEPs were not different before and after NMES. At the SAI interval, conditioned MEPs were 25% smaller than unconditioned MEPs before NMES but conditioned and unconditioned MEPs were not different following NMES. At the AF interval, conditioned MEPs were not different from unconditioned MEPs before NMES, but were facilitated by 33% following NMES. Thus, when NMES increases CS excitability there are concurrent changes in the effect of afferent input on M1 excitability, resulting in a net increase in the excitatory effect of the ascending afferent volley on CS circuits. Maximising this excitatory effect on M1 circuits may help strengthen CS pathways and improve functional outcomes of NMES-based rehabilitation programs.", "pages": "300-7"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "The clinical characteristics of motor function in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients with complete corticospinal tract injury.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "14677399", "authors": ["Cho, HM", "Choi, BY", "Chang, CH", "Kim, SH", "Lee, J", "Chang, MC", "Son, SM", "Jang, SH"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroRehabilitation", "abstract": "Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) of the left temporo-parietal cortex (LTPC) has been proposed as a useful therapeutic method for auditory hallucinations (AHs).

We compared corticospinal influences at wrist positions established before and after voluntary motion with those established before and after involuntary motion elicited by sudden removal of a load (the unloading reflex). To minimize the effect of motoneuronal excitability on the evaluation of corticospinal influences, motor potentials from transcranial magnetic stimulation of the wrist motor cortex area were evoked during an EMG silent period produced by brief muscle shortening. The motoneuronal excitability was thus equalized at different wrist positions. Results showed that the unloading reflex was generated in the presence of a corticospinal drive, rather than autonomously by the spinal cord. Although the tonic EMG levels were substantially different, the corticospinal influences remained the same at the pre- and post-unloading wrist positions. These influences however changed when subjects voluntarily moved the wrist to another position. Previous studies showed that the corticospinal system sets the referent position (R) at which neuromuscular posture-stabilizing mechanisms begin to act. In self-initiated actions, the corticospinal system shifts the R to relay these mechanisms to a new posture, thus converting them from mechanisms resisting to those assisting motion. This solves the classical posture-movement problem. In contrast, by maintaining the R value constant, the corticospinal system relies on these posture-stabilizing mechanisms to allow involuntary responses to occur after unloading. Thus, central control strategies underlying the two types of motor actions are fundamentally different.", "pages": "300-7"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Corticospinal and intracortical excitability of the quadriceps in active older and younger healthy adults.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15090478", "authors": ["Stevens-Lapsley, JE", "Thomas, AC", "Hedgecock, JB", "Kluger, BM"], "year": "", "journal": "Archives of gerontology and geriatrics", "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) guided as to localization and effect by continuous EEG on a super-refractory status epilepticus unresponsive to conventional treatment for 44 days including repeated deep sedation.

Imaging and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies suggest that increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation and integrity may be associated with increased resistance to smoking cues. Anodal tDCS of the DLPFC, believed to boost activation, reduces cravings in response to these cues. The finding that noninvasive stimulation modifies cue induced cravings has profound implications for understanding the processes underlying addiction and relapse. tDCS can also be applied to probe mechanisms underlying and supporting nicotine addiction, as was done in a pharmacologic study that applied nicotine, tDCS, and TMS paired associative stimulation to find that stopping nicotine after chronic use induces a reduction in plasticity, causing difficulty in breaking free from association between cues and cravings.

While individuals born the earliest are at most risk, late preterm children also experience significant motor, cognitive and behavioural dysfunction from school age, and reduced income and educational attainment in adulthood. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional assessments to examine corticomotor development in 151 children without cerebral palsy, aged 10-13 years and born after gestations of 25-41 completed weeks. We hypothesized that motor cortex and corticospinal development are altered in preterm children, which underpins at least some of their motor dysfunction. We report for the first time that every week of reduced gestation is associated with a reduction in corticomotor excitability that remains evident in late childhood. This reduced excitability was associated with poorer motor skill development, particularly manual dexterity. However, child adiposity, sex and socio-economic factors regarding the child's home environment soon after birth were also powerful influences on development of motor skills. Preterm birth was also associated with reduced left hemisphere lateralization, but without increasing the likelihood of being left handed per se. These corticomotor findings have implications for normal motor development, but also raise questions regarding possible longer term consequences of preterm birth on motor function.", "pages": "300-7"}, {"volume": "236", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of visual cortex in memory: cortical state, interference and reactivation of visual content in memory.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11392870", "authors": ["van de Ven, V", "Sack, AT"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "Neuronal plasticity is crucial for flexible interaction with a changing environment and its disruption is thought to contribute to psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive tool to increase local excitability of neurons and induce short-time functional reorganization of cortical networks. While this has been shown for the motor system, little is known about the short-term plasticity of networks for executive cognition in humans. We examined 12 healthy control subjects in a crossover study with fMRI after real and sham 5 Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During scanning, subjects performed an n-back working memory (WM) task and a flanker task engaging cognitive control. Reaction times during the n-back task were significantly shorter after rTMS than after sham stimulation. RTMS compared with sham stimulation caused no activation changes at the stimulation site (right DLPFC) itself, but significantly increased connectivity within the WM network during n-back and reduced activation in the anterior cingulate cortex during the flanker task. Reduced reaction times after real stimulation support an excitatory effect of high-frequency rTMS. Our findings identified plastic changes in prefrontally connected networks downstream of the stimulation site as the substrate of this behavioral effect. Using a multimodal fMRI-rTMS approach, we could demonstrate changes in cortical plasticity in humans during executive cognition. In further studies this approach could be used to study pharmacological, genetic and disease-related alterations.

However, little is known about its neural underpinnings. Imaging studies have suggested that the brain's default network is involved with self-related processing and that one portion of the default network, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), is particularly involved with self-evaluation. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to causally demonstrate that this network, and particularly MPFC, is involved with self-evaluative processing. In a first experiment, 27 healthy volunteers judged whether adjectives, evenly divided between desirable and undesirable traits, described themselves or their best friends, and a robust self-enhancement bias effect was found. In a second experiment, single-pulse TMS was applied targeting three locations (MPFC and left and right parietal cortex) in a different group of healthy volunteers while they performed the adjective task. In each trial, TMS was applied at one of five different times relative to onset of the adjective ranging from 0 to 480\u00a0ms. TMS affected self-enhancement bias in a site- and latency-specific manner: at MPFC, the self-enhancement bias actually reversed at 160\u00a0ms, with subjects favoring their best friend over themselves. TMS may thus be of use in investigating areas of mental illness in which self-evaluation is abnormal, potentially as a diagnostic tool.
