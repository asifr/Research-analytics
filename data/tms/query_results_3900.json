The 10-20 system correlates external skull locations with the underlying cortical areas. This system accounts for variability in patient skull size by using certain percentages of the circumference and distances between four basic anatomical landmarks. This 10-20 system has recently been used in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) research for locating specific cortical areas. In the treatment of depression (and some types of pain), the desired placement of the TMS coil is often above the left dorsalateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) which corresponds to the F3 location given by the 10-20 system. However, for an administrator with little experience with the 10-20 system, the numerous measurements and calculations can be excessively time-consuming. Additionally, with more measurements comes more opportunity for human error. For this reason we have developed a new, simpler and faster way to find the F3 position using only three skull measurements. In this paper, we describe and illustrate the application of the new F3 location system, provide the formulas used in the calculation of the F3 position, and summarize data from 10 healthy adults. After using both the International 10-20 system and this new method, it appears that the new method is sufficiently accurate; however, future investigations may be warranted to conduct more in dept analyses of the method's utility and potential limitations. This system requires less time and training to find the optimal position for prefrontal coil placement and it saves considerable time compared to the 10-20 EEG system.", "pages": "300-5"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Impact of early applied upper limb stimulation: the EXPLICIT-stroke programme design.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19097183", "authors": ["Kwakkel, G", "Meskers, CG", "van Wegen, EE", "Lankhorst, GJ", "Geurts, AC", "van Kuijk, AA", "Lindeman, E", "Visser-Meily, A", "de Vlugt, E", "Arendzen, JH"], "year": "2008", "journal": "BMC neurology", "abstract": "Tinnitus is an auditory phantom sensation characterized by the perception of elementary sound or noise in the absence of any acoustical sound source. Tinnitus is a frequent disorder and is difficult to treat. Compelling evidence corroborates the perception of chronic tinnitus as associated with regional changes in cortical excitability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the temporal or the temporoparietal cortex has recently been introduced as a new treatment strategy for tinnitus. The technique has been applied in two different ways in tinnitus patients. Single sessions of high-frequency rTMS have been successful in transient reduction of tinnitus perception, whereas repeated sessions of low-frequency rTMS have resulted in longer-lasting tinnitus reduction, indicating therapeutic potential. However, treatment outcome so far is characterized by high interindividual variability and only moderate effect size. This study reviews different approaches for enhancement of rTMS effects in tinnitus patients. The different strategies include the combined stimulation of nonauditory and auditory brain areas, the variation of stimulation frequencies and intensities, and the comparison of different firing modes (burst vs. tonic stimulation). Furthermore, the value of optimum patient selection is discussed. Another approach consists of a combination of rTMS administration with pharmacological intervention. Repetition of rTMS treatment in treatment responders seems to be a promising approach for the prolongation of treatment effects. A pilot study suggests further that treatment effects can be enhanced by combined stimulation of auditory and nonauditory brain areas. Moreover, clinical data such as tinnitus duration and the dimension of hearing loss seem to have an important impact on treatment effects. Successful enhancement of treatment effects will depend on a more detailed understanding of the neuronal correlates of the different forms of tinnitus and the mechanisms by which rTMS exerts its effects.", "pages": "300-5"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Proteomic analysis in human fibroblasts by continuous exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields.", "issue": "22", "pmid": "19097080", "authors": ["Seyyedi, SS", "Dadras, MS", "Tavirani, MR", "Mozdarani, H", "Toossi, P", "Zali, AR"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Pakistan journal of biological sciences: PJBS", "abstract": "Stimulation-induced plasticity represents an experimental model of motor cortex reorganization. It can be produced in awaked humans by combining the non-invasive electrical stimulation of somatosensory afferents via mixed peripheral nerves with the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. Animal experiments indicate that an application of two converging inputs from various sources in a tightly coupled manner, following the so called Hebbian rule of learning, leads to an increase in motor cortical excitability. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of two plasticity-inducing protocols by quantifying the motor cortex changes using TMS. Plasticity was induced by combining peripheral nerve stimulation with TMS (paired associative stimulation - PAS) and by peripheral motor point stimulation of two adjacent hand muscles (dual associative stimulation - DAS). The protocols were randomly applied in 12 right-handed healthy volunteers. The amplitudes of TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle were recorded before, immediately after PAS or DAS stimulation, and 10, 20 and 30 min later. Both protocols led to significant and lasting changes in MEP amplitudes, however, a significantly larger increase in MEPs was observed after PAS than DAS. The results indicate that afferent input can differently affect cortical motor circuits and produce variable motor output. Thus, the efficacy of LTP-like mechanisms, presumably involved in Hebbian-like plasticity in humans, varies with the types/origin of the converging inputs.

In spasticity, exaggeration of the stretch reflex results in increased resistance during passive movements. Therefore, spasticity is pathophysiologically described as increased muscle tone whose pathognomonic sign is decreased passivity. Resistance is more strongly felt during rapid passive movements than during slow movements. The resistance felt at the beginning of the passive movement abruptly diminishes, which is well known as the clasp-knife phenomenon. Another character of spasticity is the distribution of the increment in the muscle tone. Not only rigidity, dystonia, and muscle stiffness demonstrating increased muscle tone, but also Gegenhalten and contracture of joint with normal muscle tone should be differentiated. No neurophysiological parameters reflect the degree of spasticity in a strictly parallel fashion. However, neurophysiological examinations provide some supportive objective data. Surface electromyography is useful to distinguish spasticity from rigidity and other conditions with increase muscle tone. The increased amplitude ratio and the decreased threshold ratio of the H-wave to the M-wave, and increased amplitude and persistence of the F-wave are observed the patients with spasticity. Magnetic stimulation is a useful tool to detect corticospinal tract lesions that induce leading to spasticity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic brainstem stimulation, and magnetic spinal motor root stimulation are used to examine the entire motor pathway. Since positive correlation between spasticity and shortening of the silent period is reported, many investigations including paired-pulse magnetic stimulation will be necessary for understanding pathophysiology of spasticity. Patients with mild and reversible spasticity are usually treated with medications. Significant variations exist in the use of these therapies, because the treatments often depend on the clinicians' experience.

Higher frequencies (100-640 Hz) appear to be responsible for generating this excitability increase, an effect that may be attributed to the repeated opening of Na(+) channels.

Healthy young individuals (n = 16) were trained to produce rhythmic to and fro movements at the sound of metronome ticks (0.8 Hz frequency, 5 s total duration) with either the index or the little finger of the right hand. In the tactile discrimination (TD) condition, participants were asked to attend to the location of two different 2-D tactile shapes disposed on the explored surface, whereas in the ND condition, the finger was moved over a blank surface. In both conditions, a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse was delivered at a specific time point in the course of the finger movement. Corticomotor excitability was assessed by monitoring changes in the amplitude and latency of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the FDI and ADM. Changes in the duration of the silent period were also assessed. The analysis revealed a significant large effect of task conditions (P < 0.001) on MEP amplitude, owing to the increase in MEP size observed during the TD, as compared to the ND condition. No interaction between \"Task\" and \"Muscle\" was detected, however, indicating that MEPs in the two muscles were equally affected by the task conditions. No significant changes were detected for variations in MEP latency or in the SP duration. An additional control experiment performed in a subset of the participants (n = 9) showed that MEP facilitation was substantially reduced when attention to sensations arising from finger contact with the shapes was diverted away by completion of a concurrent cognitive task (counting backward by three).

The development of stable neurological deficit in secondary-progressive MS is determined by impairments to spike conduction processes associated with significant levels of demyelination and atrophic changes in the CNS, with myelin loss and axon death. Finally, the severity of cognitive changes is determined by differences in the severities of both the focal demyelinating process and diffuse damage to brain substance in MS, including the neurodegenerative component.

Subjects were instructed either to compensate (COMP) the perturbation (applied at variable delays) or not to intervene (NINT). In a quarter of all trials at random, in the time window when perturbation might occur, TMS was applied over contralateral M1. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in the FCR (flexor carpi radialis) and ECR (extensor carpi radialis) muscles, as well as the silent period (SP) in the FCR. Following the perturbation, we found a larger long-latency stretch reflex in COMP than in NINT. During the expectation of the perturbation, MEP amplitudes did not differ across conditions in FCR. However, those evoked in ECR were greater in COMP than in NINT condition. Moreover in the FCR, the silent period lasted longer in NINT. Thus, we showed a selective effect of the prepared reaction on the anticipatory tuning of CS excitability and cortical inhibition in the agonist/antagonist muscles. This tuning clearly differed from the tuning during voluntary movement preparation without variation in the external forces.

All remained still during the last two scans (rest). Two stroke patients underwent the same protocol with rTMS applied on contralesional M1. Compared with Sham-rTMS, Real-rTMS over the right M1 was followed by a significant increase of rCBF during right hand movement in left S1M1, without any significant change in motor performance. The effect lasted less than 1 h. The same rTMS-induced S1M1 overactivation was observed in the two stroke patients. Commissural connectivity between right dorsal premotor cortex and left M1 after real-rTMS was observed with a psychophysiological interaction analysis in healthy subjects.

Here we examined whether supraspinal factors contribute to impaired central drive after locomotor endurance exercise. On 2 separate days, 10 moderately active individuals completed a locomotor cycling exercise session or a control session. Brief (2 s) and sustained (30 s) isometric knee extension contractions were completed before and after locomotor exercise consisting of eight, 5-min bouts of cycling at 80% of maximum workload. In the control session, subjects completed the isometric contractions in a rested state. Twitch responses to supramaximal motor nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained to assess peripheral force-generating capacity and voluntary activation. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force during brief contractions decreased by 23 +/- 6.3% after cycling exercise and remained 12 +/- 2.8% below baseline 45 min later (F(1,9) > 15.5; P < 0.01). Resting twitch amplitudes declined by approximately 45% (F(1,9) = 28.3; P < 0.001). Cortical voluntary activation declined from 90.6 +/- 1.6% at baseline to 80.6 +/- 2.1% after exercise (F(1,9) = 28.0; P < 0.001) and remained significantly reduced relative to control 30-45 min later (80.6 +/- 3.4%; F(1,9) = 10.7; P < 0.01). Thus locomotor exercise caused a long-lasting impairment in the capacity of the motor cortex to drive the knee extensors. Force was reduced more during sustained MVC after locomotor exercise than in the control session. Peripheral mechanisms contributed relatively more to this force reduction in the control session, whereas supraspinal fatigue played a greater role in sustained MVC reduction after locomotor exercise.", "pages": "300-5"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Spinal cord contusion based on precise vertebral stabilization and tissue displacement measured by combined assessment to discriminate small functional differences.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "15277960", "authors": ["Zhang, YP", "Burke, DA", "Shields, LB", "Chekmenev, SY", "Dincman, T", "Zhang, Y", "Zheng, Y", "Smith, RR", "Benton, RL", "DeVries, WH", "Hu, X", "Magnuson, DS", "Whittemore, SR", "Shields, CB"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to document some apparent interhemispheric influences behaviorally, with TMS over the right parietal cortex reported to enhance processing of touch for the ipsilateral right hand (Seyal et al., 1995). However, the neural bases of such apparent interhemispheric influences from TMS remain unknown. Here, we studied this directly by combining TMS with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We applied bursts of 10 Hz TMS over right parietal cortex, at a high or low intensity, during two sensory contexts: either without any other stimulation, or while participants received median nerve stimulation to the right wrist, which projects to left primary somatosensory cortex (SI). TMS to right parietal cortex affected the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in left SI, with high- versus low-intensity TMS increasing the left SI signal during right-wrist somatosensory input, but decreasing this in the absence of somatosensory input. This state-dependent modulation of SI by parietal TMS over the other hemisphere was accompanied by a related pattern of TMS-induced influences in the thalamus, as revealed by region-of-interest analyses. A behavioral experiment confirmed that the same right parietal TMS protocol of 10 Hz bursts led to enhanced detection of perithreshold electrical stimulation of the right median nerve, which is initially processed in left SI. Our results confirm directly that TMS over right parietal cortex can affect processing in left SI of the other hemisphere, with rivalrous effects (possibly transcallosal) arising in the absence of somatosensory input, but facilitatory effects (possibly involving thalamic circuitry) in the presence of driving somatosensory input.", "pages": "300-5"}, {"volume": "197", "title": "Visual trajectory perception in humans: is it lateralized?

This is termed practice-dependent plasticity, and is abolished by the NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan and the GABA(A) agonist lorazepam. Here, we sought to determine whether specific subtypes of GABA(A) circuits are responsible for this effect by comparing the action of the non-selective agonist, lorazepam with that of the selective GABA(A)-alpha(1) receptor agonist, zolpidem. In seven healthy subjects, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to quantify changes in amplitude of MEP after practice of a ballistic motor task. In addition we measured how the same drugs affected MEP amplitudes and the excitability of a number of cortical inhibitory circuits [short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), short-interval afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-interval intracortical inhibition]. This allowed us to explore correlations between drugs effects in measures of cortical excitability and practice-dependent plasticity of MEP amplitudes. As previously reported, lorazepam increased SICI and decreased SAI, while zolpidem only decreased SAI. The new findings were that practice-dependent plasticity of MEPs was impaired by lorazepam but not zolpidem, and that this was negatively correlated with lorazepam-induced changes in SICI but not SAI. This suggests that the intracortical circuits involved in SICI (and not neurons expressing GABA(A)-alpha(1) receptor subunits that are implicated in SAI) may be involved in controlling the amount of practice-dependent MEP plasticity.", "pages": "300-5"}]
