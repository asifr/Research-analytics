TMS is performed with various coil orientations over the hand or leg motor areas and surface EMG, and single motor unit recordings are made either from the studied hand or leg muscle. Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) is also performed over the motor cortex as well as at the foramen magnum level to determine the latency of D waves. The intensity of stimulation is set just above the motor threshold for each type of stimulation. This method makes it possible to activate some I volleys (especially I1 and I3 waves) preferentially, if not selectively, from the hand and leg motor areas.

The amount of electrical energy needed for TMS to induce motor movement (called the motor threshold [MT]), varies widely across individuals. The intensity of TMS is dosed relative to the MT. Kozel et al observed in a depressed cohort that MT increases as a function of distance from coil to cortex. This article examines this relationship in a healthy cohort and compares the two methods of assessing distance to cortex. Seventeen healthy adults had their TMS MT determined and marked with a fiducial. Magnetic resonance images showed the fiducials marking motor cortex, allowing researchers to measure distance from scalp to motor and prefontal cortex using two methods: 1) measuring a line from scalp to the nearest cortex and 2) sampling the distance from scalp to cortex of two 18-mm-square areas. Confirming Kozel's previous finding, we observe that motor threshold increases as distance to motor cortex increased for both methods of measuring distance and that no significant correlation exists between MT and prefontal cortex distance. Distance from TMS coil to motor cortex is an important determinant of MT in healthy and depressed adults. Distance to prefontal cortex is not correlated with MT, raising questions about the common practice of dosing prefontal stimulation using MT determined over motor cortex.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Current trends in electroencephalography.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11262735", "authors": ["Blume, WT"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Current opinion in neurology", "abstract": "To examine the experience, knowledge and attitudes of recipients of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) regarding the treatment.

Neuroscience", "abstract": "Several recent articles re-emphasize the value of clinical electrophysiology: in localizing epileptogenesis, predicting effectiveness of epilepsy surgery, and disclosing a mechanism of benign Rolandic epilepsy of childhood.A review of the role of EEG in the diagnosis of epilepsy indicated that epileptiform activity will appear in 50% of initial awake recordings of adults with epilepsy and in 85% of subjects undergoing two recordings. This contrasts with the appearance of spikes in only 4 of 1000 normal persons. Several studies focused on the value of electroencephalography in extratemporal epilepsy: 62% of patients with neocortical epilepsy had at least one localizing ictal EEG; occipital and temporal neocortical seizures were localized in a greater proportion than frontal or parietal attacks. Interictal spikes, if unifocal, always arose from the epileptogenic region in a study of their seizure localizing value. Such congruence augured for better seizure control by focal resection in two studies reviewed herein. Studies indicating the value of interictal temporal lobe spikes and scalp-recorded seizures in lateralising a temporal seizure focus are reviewed. One study found EEG to be slightly more reliable for lateralization of temporal epileptogenesis than MRI. In patients with benign Rolandic seizures, enhanced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained from transcranial magnetic stimulation when this was applied 50-80 msec after electrical stimulation of the thumb whereas this interval inhibited the MEP in normal subjects. This suggests that afferent cutaneous input abnormally and synchronously activates a large population of sensory neurons; such activation is subsequently transmitted to the motor cortex to produce the focal spikes in this condition.Finally, advances in non-invasive technology have redefined and limited the need for invasive monitoring in children with intractable seizure disorders.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: perspectives for application in the treatment of bipolar and unipolar disorders.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11252662", "authors": ["Nahas, Z", "Molloy, MA", "Hughes, PL", "Oliver, NC", "Arana, GW", "Risch, SC", "George, MS"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Bipolar disorders", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method for local stimulation of cerebral cortex using a small coil's pulsed magnetic field.

Because the magnetic field distributions of stimulation coils are 1-2 centimeters wide and 2-3 centimeters long, and the induced electric fields are even broader, the resolution of TMS maps is limited and the actual region of cortical stimulation is poorly defined.

We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the corticomotor projection to the affected and unaffected hands in a group of subjects with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, and also performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the patterns of activation in cortical motor and sensory areas following active and passive movement of the hands. Both TMS and fMRI demonstrated a normal contralateral motor and sensory projection between the unaffected hand and the cerebral hemisphere. However, in the case of the affected hand, the TMS results indicated either a purely ipsilateral projection or a bilateral projection in which the ipsilateral pathway had the lower motor threshold, whereas passive movement resulted in fMRI activation in the contralateral hemisphere. These results demonstrate that there is a significant fast-conducting corticomotor projection to the affected hand from the ipsilateral hemisphere in this group of subjects, but that the predominant afferent projection from the hand is still directed to the affected contralateral hemisphere, resulting in an interhemispheric dissociation between afferent kinesthetic inputs and efferent corticomotor output. The findings indicate that there can be differences in the organization of sensory and motor pathways in cerebral palsy, and suggest that some of the residual motor dysfunction experienced by these subjects could be due to an impairment of sensorimotor integration at cortical level as a result of reorganization in the motor system.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Application of pudendal evoked potentials in diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9575308", "authors": ["Zhu, GY", "Shen, Y"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Asian journal of andrology", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) remains unknown.

When the stretch was applied in the swing phase, only small and variable reflex responses were observed in the active tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Two of the reflex responses that could be distinguished had latencies which were comparable with the early (M1) and late (M3)components of the three reflex responses (M1, M2 and M3) observed during tonic dorsiflexion in sitting subjects. In the stance phase a single very large response was consistently observed in the inactive TA muscle. The peak of this response had the same latency as the peak of M3, but in the majority of subjects the onset latency was shorter than that of M3. The TA reflex response in the stance phase was abolished by ischaemia of the lower leg at the same time as the soleus H-reflex, suggesting that large muscle afferents were involved in the generation of the response. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited in the TA by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were strongly facilitated corresponding to the peak of the stretch response in the stance phase and the late reflex response in the swing phase. A similar facilitation was not observed corresponding to the earlier responses in the swing phase and the initial part of the response in stance. Prior stretch did not facilitate MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation in the swing phase of walking. However, in the stance phase MEPs elicited by strong electrical stimulation were facilitated by prior stretch to the same extent as the MEPs evoked by TMS. The large responses to stretch seen in the stance phase are consistent with the idea that stretch reflexes are mainly involved in securing the stability of the supporting leg during walking.

Cathodal tDCS resulted in a global decrease of the mean number of activated pixels by 38% (P < 0.01) 0-5 min after stimulation, which reduced to 28% (P < 0.05) 15-20 min after stimulation. A region-of-interest analysis revealed a 57% decrease of activated pixels (P < 0.001) in the supplementary motor area, but no change in the hand area of the primary motor cortex. Anodal tDCS yielded a nonsignificant 5% increase of activated pixels with no regional differences. These findings support the view that reduced neuroaxonal excitability after cathodal tDCS causes reduced brain activity.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between TMS-induced early muscle and late swallowing activities in the feline model. Twelve adult cats were studied under light anaesthesia. Mylohyoid and oesophageal EMG, together with pharyngeal, upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) and upper oesophageal manometry, were recorded to single-pulse TMS of cat cortex. TMS at low stimulation intensities evoked consistent short latency EMG responses in the mylohyoid and oesophageal muscles (6.1 +/- 1.2 ms and 12.7 +/- 0.7 ms, respectively), and early contractile activity in the UOS (latency 31.8 +/- 3.6 ms). By contrast, TMS at high intensities induced swallowing activity as indicated by mylohyoid EMG, and UOS relaxation (latencies 1.1 +/- 0.4 s and 0.8 +/- 0.1 s, respectively). Both the early muscle and late swallowing activities were intensity-dependent, increasing stimulus strength producing a reduction in latency and greater number of swallows.

Changes in motor threshold and in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and latency in keeping with persisting impairment of conduction in the corticospinal pathway were still present in the majority of subjects, whereas the duration of the post-MEP silent period, reflecting the strength of long-latency intracortical inhibition, was usually normal. Topographic shifts in the corticomotor representation relative to the unaffected side were found in the majority of subjects. In some the shifts were in the mediolateral axis suggesting reorganisation within the primary motor cortex, while in the others anteroposterior shifts were present in keeping with recruitment of premotor or postcentral cortex. The present findings indicate that changes in the physiological properties of the corticomotor projection to the hand are frequently present in subjects who have recovered motor function after a subcortical stroke and may persist indefinitely.

As a new approach, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex was used to trigger motor paroxysms and to monitor cortical excitability during attacks. Motor paroxysms could be provoked by muscle vibration, passive movements, TMS, magnetic stimulation of the brachial plexus, and electrical nerve stimulation. Sham stimulation over the motor cortex and thermal and tactile cutaneous stimuli were ineffective in triggering attacks. It is concluded that dystonic attacks are triggered by proprioceptive afferents rather than cutaneous stimuli or the descending motor command itself. Outside the attacks, motor cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuronal mechanisms as assessed by TMS (response threshold and amplitudes, duration of the contralateral and ipsilateral silent period, corticocortical inhibition, and facilitation) were normal, which underlines the paroxysmal character of the disorder.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "529 Pt 2", "title": "Paired transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols reveal a pattern of inhibition and facilitation in the human parietal cortex.", "issue": "", "pmid": "8614521", "authors": ["Oliveri, M", "Caltagirone, C", "Filippi, MM", "Traversa, R", "Cicinelli, P", "Pasqualetti, P", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "2000", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Fifteen years after its introduction by Anthony Barker, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) appears to be 'coming of age' in cognitive neuroscience and promises to reshape the way we investigate brain-behavior relations.

As illustrated by several experiments over the past couple of years, this property of TMS allows us to investigate the relationship between focal cortical activity and behavior, to trace the timing at which activity in a particular cortical region contributes to a given task, and to map the functional connectivity between brain regions.", "pages": "61-7"}, {"volume": "529 Pt 2", "title": "A window into the role of inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms of perception?", "issue": "", "pmid": "8547583", "authors": ["Cohen, LG"], "year": "2000", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Binocular rivalry refers to the alternating perceptual states that occur when the images seen by the two eyes are too different to be fused into a single percept. Logothetis and colleagues have challenged suggestions that this phenomenon occurs early in the visual pathway. They have shown that, in alert monkeys, neurons in the primary visual cortex continue to respond to their preferred stimulus despite the monkey reporting its absence. Moreover, they found that neural activity higher in the visual pathway is highly correlated with the monkey's reported percept. These and other findings suggest that the neural substrate of binocular rivalry must involve high levels, perhaps the same levels involved in reversible figure alternations.", "pages": "61-7"}]
