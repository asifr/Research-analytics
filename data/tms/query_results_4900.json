Recently we developed a stimulation paradigm, which evokes convergent afferent input from two hand muscles and induces reorganisation within human motor cortex. Here we investigated whether this reorganisation is characterised by expansion and greater overlap of muscle representation zones, as reported in animal models. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we mapped the motor representation of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in 24 healthy subjects before and after 1 h of (1) associative stimulation to FDI and ADM motor points, (2) associative stimulation to digits II and V (3) a control condition employing non-correlated stimulation of FDI and ADM motor points. Motor point associative stimulation induced a significant increase in the number of active sites in all three muscles and volume in FDI and ADM. Additionally, the centre of gravity of the FDI and ADM maps shifted closer together. Similar changes were not observed following digital associative stimulation or motor point non-associative stimulation. These novel findings provide evidence that convergent input induces reorganisation of the human motor cortex characterised by expansion and greater overlap of representational zones.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Role of spinal inhibitory mechanisms in whiplash injuries.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "17600520", "authors": ["Lo, YL", "Tan, YE", "Fook-Chong, S", "Boolsambatra, P", "Yue, WM", "Chan, LL", "Tan, SB"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "abstract": "Whiplash injury, commonly encountered in road traffic accidents, is a major cause of morbidity.

Skilled limb movements begin to be expressed as the map develops. Development of the proper connections between CS axons and spinal neurons in cats depends on CS neural activity and motor behavioral experience during a critical postnatal period. Reversible CS inactivation or preventing limb use produces an aberrant distribution of CS axon terminations and impairs visually guided movements. This altered pattern of CS connections after inactivation in cats resembles the aberrant pattern of motor responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients. Left untreated in the cat, these impairments do not resolve. We have found that activity-dependent processes can be harnessed in cats to reestablish normal CS connections and function.

Because TMS over cortical regions of interest other than motor cortex often does not produce easily observable effects, the ability to calibrate TMS intensity for stimulation over nonmotor regions can be problematic. Previous studies reported no correlation between motor thresholds (MT) over the motor cortex and phosphene thresholds (PT) over the visual cortex. However, different thresholding methods, lighting, and eye-closure conditions were used to determine MT and PT. We investigated the correlation between resting MT (rMT), active MT (aMT), and PT in 27 dark-adapted healthy volunteers. All thresholds were measured with eyes-open in the dark and determined by gradually reducing stimulation intensity downward. All subjects had aMT and rMT; 21 subjects had measurable PT. rMT was 70.4% +/- 9.8% (mean +/- SD of maximum stimulator output); aMT was 61.1% +/- 7.9%; PT was 82.2% +/- 10.1%. A significant positive correlation was found between aMT and PT (r = 0.53; P = 0.014) with a trend toward correlation between rMT and PT (r = 0.43; P = 0.052). Our results suggest that sensitivity to TMS over visual and motor cortices may be correlated under similar thresholding procedures.

Resting motor threshold, motor-evoked potential (MEP), input-output curve, cortical silent period duration, interference pattern (IP) and M/F ratio were recorded at baseline, immediately after fatigue and after 20 min rest. Immediately after exercise, decreased MEP amplitude and increased cortical SP duration were observed in the control group whilst no such changes were observed in PD patients. The input-output curve was also significantly suppressed only in controls, but not in patients. The amplitude of IP was significantly reduced immediately after exercise in both PD patients and controls. Almost all these changes returned nearly to baseline values after 20 min rest. The amount of exercise was approximately equal in both groups because the effect on M-waves and EMG amplitude was similar. However, the expected decline in corticospinal excitability was absent in PD patients.

Seventeen participants (eight males, nine females; mean age 9y 1mo [SD 3y 2mo]) with cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia were randomized to receive sham, active 1Hz, or active 5Hz repetitive TMS of the primary motor cortex.

Electrical activities of the muscles, induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation to the brain, i.e., motor evoked potentials (MEPs), are used for estimation of the excitability of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. It is well known that rotational positioning of the forearm influences MEPs of forearm muscles through modulation of excitability in the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated whether such a posture-dependent change of MEPs could be found in upper arm and intrinsic hand muscles at three different rotational forearm positions: the most internal (pronation), neutral, and most external (supination) positions of rotation. MEPs were simultaneously recorded from the four muscles, biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and abductor pollicis brevis (AbPB). MEP amplitudes and latencies in BB, TB and ADM were significantly larger and shorter, respectively, in supination compared to the values in other positions. By contrast, MEP of AbPB in supination was lower in amplitude and longer in latency. Importantly, muscle lengths of TB, ADM and AbPB are constant in any rotational forearm positions, excluding the possibility of the muscle-length dependent change of spinal reflex. Therefore, these results might be attributable to the posture-dependent modulation of the motor cortex activity for the upper limb. The motor cortex probably changes the control strategy for the upper limb muscles in accordance with the sensory input from the forearm.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "212", "title": "Modulation of excitability in the cerebral cortex projecting to upper extremity muscles by rotational positioning of the forearm.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8895455", "authors": ["Mitsuhashi, K", "Seki, K", "Akamatsu, C", "Handa, Y"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "abstract": "Topographical cortical organization of sensorimotor area has been shown to be highly plastic, altering his configuration in response to training in different tasks in healthy controls and neurological patients. The term ''brain plasticity'' encompasses all possible mechanisms of neuronal reorganization: recruitment of pathways that are functionally homologous to, but anatomically distinct from, the damaged ones (eg, non-pyramidal corticospinal pathways), synaptogenesis, dendritic arborisation and reinforcement of existing but functionally silent synaptic connections (particularly at the periphery of core lesion). The study of neuroplasticity has clearly shown the ability of the developing brain--and of the adult and ageing brain--to be shaped by environmental inputs both under normal conditions (ie, learning) and after a lesion. Neuronal aggregates adjacent, or distant to a lesion in the sensorimotor area can progressively adopt the function of the injured area. Imaging studies indicate that recovery of motor function after a lesion (i.e. stroke) is associated with a progressive change of activation patterns in specific brain structures. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) can detect reshaping of sensorimotor areas; they have a high temporal resolution but have several limitations. TMS can only provide bidimensional scalp maps and MEG depicts three-dimensional spatial characteristics of virtual neural generators obtained by use of a mathematical model of the head and brain. However, the use of objective methods that assess brain reactivity to a physical stimulus (i.e., TMS) or to a sensory input (ie, electrical stimulation to hand and fingers) can integrate information from self-paced motor tasks, because the resolution of abnormal activation over time could be secondary to recovery. Functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), on their own, have insufficient time resolution to follow the hierarchical activation of relays within a neural network; however, because of their excellent spatial resolution, they can integrate the findings of TMS and MEG.

In the present study we show that by combining a specially adapted recording system with software artifact correction it is possible to remove a major part of the artifact and analyze the cortical responses as early as 10 ms after TMS. We used this methodology to examine responses of left and right primary motor cortex (M1) to TMS at different intensities. Based on the artifact-corrected data we propose a model for the cortical activation following M1 stimulation. The model revealed the same basic response sequence for both hemispheres. A large part of the response could be accounted for by two sources: a source close to the stimulation site (peaking approximately 15 ms after the stimulus) and a midline frontal source ipsilateral to the stimulus (peaking approximately 25 ms). In addition the model suggests responses in ipsilateral temporo-parietal junction areas (approximately 35 ms) and ipsilateral (approximately 30 ms) and middle (approximately 50 ms) cerebellum.

One way to contribute to the scientific discussion on this topic is to deliver transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and test the cortical silent period (SP) recorded in facial muscles. The facial-muscle SP is a purely cortical phenomenon that reflects the excitability of inhibitory interneurons, and can disclose changes in cortical inhibition even in patients without documented primary lesions of the motor cortices. To test the interictal excitability of cortical motor inhibitory interneurons in migraine, we investigated the facial-SP in patients with migraine with and without aura between attacks. In 26 patients and 15 age-matched controls, high-intensity magnetic stimuli were delivered with a round coil centered at the vertex during a maximal muscle contraction. Electromyographic responses were recorded from surface electrodes placed over the subjects' perioral muscles. Facial SPs were significantly shorter in patients than in controls. The SP shortening provides neurophysiological evidence showing hypoexcitability of cortical inhibitory neurons in patients with migraine between attacks. Despite a possible primary deficit of cortical inhibitory interneurons in migraine, we favor the interpretation of a secondary disfacilitation by hypoactive thalamo-cortical loops. Based on this interpretation, the interictal reduced cortical inhibition documented by the shortened SP could be considered the motor counterpart of the reduced preactivation excitability level in the sensory cortices purported to explain why cortical evoked responses habituate poorly in patients with migraine.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Role of sustained excitability of the leg motor cortex after transcranial magnetic stimulation in associative plasticity.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "1374346", "authors": ["Roy, FD", "Norton, JA", "Gorassini, MA"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Retention of motor learning can be enhanced or degraded by subsequent performance of a different task.

We measured the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle after continuous or intermittent theta burst (cTBS/iTBS) forms of rTMS. In resting subjects, cTBS depressed MEPs and reduced SICI for about 20 min, whereas iTBS had the opposite effect. However, if subjects contracted the FDI during TBS, then effects on the MEP were abolished, although effects of cTBS on SICI remained. Contraction immediately after TBS enhanced the facilitatory effect of iTBS and reversed the usual inhibitory effect of cTBS into facilitation. Contraction 10 min after cTBS (iTBS not tested) had only a transient (3-4 min) effect on MEPs.

While TMS was applied to probe the integrity of the cortico-spinal tract (CST) at rest, MEG was used to test for recruitment of CST pathways during a motor challenge [cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) in a precision grip task]. With both techniques, crossed cortico-spinal connectivity could be demonstrated. A significant correlation (r = 0.85) of CMC magnitude and recovered muscle strength underlined the functional relevance of crossed CST integrity for successful recovery. In conclusion, at the descriptive level, crossed CST connectivity is a common finding in well-recovered patients with capsular stroke.

When TMS was applied to S1 near-synchronously to an afferent signal containing mechanoreceptive information, MN-SSEP changes (significant at 21-31 ms) could be explained by a change in a tangential source located in Brodmann area 3b, with their timing and polarity suggesting modification of upper cortical layers. PAS-induced MN-SSEP changes between 28 and 32 ms were linearly correlated with changes in tactile discrimination. Conversely, when the near-synchronous afferent signal contained predominantly proprioceptive information, PAS-induced MN-SSEP changes (20-29 ms) were shifted medially, and tactile performance remained stable. With near-synchronous mechanoreceptive stimulation subtle differences in the timing of the two interacting signals tended to influence the direction of tactile performance changes. PAS performed with TMS delivered asynchronously to the afferent pulse did not change MN-SSEPs.

This has been linked to a central comparator mechanism that uses efference copy to attenuate the predictable component of sensory inputs arising from one's own actions in order to enhance the salience of external stimuli. To provide a quantitative measure of this attenuation, a force-matching task was developed in which subjects experience a force applied to their finger and are then required to match the perceived force by actively pushing on the finger using their other hand. The attenuation of predictable sensory input results in subjects producing a larger active force than was experienced passively. Here, we have examined the effects of a novel rTMS protocol, theta-burst stimulation (TBS), over primary motor cortex on this attenuation. TBS can alter the excitability of motor cortex to incoming activity. We show that application of a 20s continuous train of TBS, that depresses motor cortex, significantly improves performance in a force-matching task. This suggests that the TBS intervention disturbed the predictive process that uses efference copy signals to attenuate predictable sensory input. A possible explanation for the effect is that TBS has a differential effect on the populations of neurones that generate motor output in M1 than on those neural structures that are involved in generating an efference copy of the motor command.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "254", "title": "Cutaneous silent periods in the evaluation of cord compression in cervical spondylosis.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16815631", "authors": ["Lo, YL", "Tan, YE", "Dan, YF", "Leoh, TH", "Tan, SB", "Tan, CT", "Chan, LL"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine the effect of voluntary contraction on the magnitude of long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and the duration of the silent period in intrinsic hand muscles.

LICI in abductor pollicis brevis (APB) decreased from the condition in which the index finger was at rest to the conditions in which it was abducted, whereas LICI in abductor digiti minimi (ADM) was unaffected by the level of index finger abduction. During voluntary abduction of the index finger, the magnitude of LICI was least in FDI, intermediate in ADM, and greatest in APB, suggesting that it may be a mechanism by which tonic activation of hand muscles is fractionated. The magnitude of LICI increased with conditioning stimulus intensity, but intensity did not interact with abduction force. The duration of the silent period (SP) in FDI decreased with the level of voluntary index finger abduction and increased with eliciting stimulus intensity. Within-subject correlations showed that the effects of voluntary drive on SP duration and motor-evoked potential amplitude did not covary, implying an indirect effect of voluntary drive on SP duration.

To this end, we used the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) approach to determine the patterns of oscillatory activity during two consecutive trains of sham and real TMS. Each train of stimulation was delivered to the left primary motor cortex (MI) of healthy subjects over a period of 10 min, while EEG rhythms were simultaneously recorded. Results indicated that TMS induced an increase in the power of brain rhythms that was related to the period of the stimulation, i.e. the synchronization of the alpha band increased with the duration of the stimulation, and this increase was inversely correlated with motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude. In conclusion, low frequency TMS over primary motor cortex induces a synchronization of the background oscillatory activity on the stimulated region.

Here we describe two further similarities in TC and CTS control using (1) an I-wave facilitation protocol and (2) preconditioning with rTMS. In experiment 1, excitability of TC pathways was measured using interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) and the ipsilateral silent period (iSP), whilst excitability of CTS pathways was measured by recording the EMG response evoked in the first dorsal interosseous muscle contralateral to the conditioning stimulus (cMEP). The intensity of the conditioning stimulus was first adjusted to threshold for evoking IHI and iSP, then pairs of conditioning stimuli were applied randomly at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) from 1.3 to 4.3 ms. IHI and iSP were facilitated at ISI=1.5 ms and 3.0 ms, respectively, as was the MEP evoked by the conditioning stimuli in the contralateral hand. We suggest that TC projections receive I-wave-like facilitation similar to that seen in CTS projections. In experiment 2, short interval inhibition of the iSP (SICIiSP), and short interval intracortical inhibition of the cMEP (SICIcMEP) were examined before and after 600 pulses of 5 Hz rTMS at 90% resting motor threshold. Both SICIiSP and SICIcMEP were reduced, as was the iSP; the cMEP was unchanged. This shows that the population of inhibitory interneurons that control TC neurons respond in the same way to 5 Hz rTMS as those that control CTS neurons.

Excessively risky or overly cautious decision making can both have disastrous real-world consequences. Weighing of risks and benefits toward decision making involves a complex neural network that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), but its role remains unclear. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that disruption of the DLPFC increases risk-taking behavior. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows upregulation of activity in the DLPFC, and we predicted that it might promote more cautious decision making. Healthy participants received one of the following treatments while they performed the Balloon Analog Risk Task: (1) right anodal/left cathodal DLPFC tDCS, (2) left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC tDCS, or (3) sham tDCS. This experiment revealed that participants receiving either one of the bilateral DLPFC tDCS strategies adopted a risk-averse response style. In a control experiment, we tested whether unilateral DLPFC stimulation (anodal tDCS over the right or left DLPFC with the cathodal electrode over the contralateral supraorbital area) was sufficient to decrease risk-taking behaviors. This experiment showed no difference in decision-making behaviors between the groups of unilateral DLPFC stimulation and sham stimulation. These findings extend the notion that DLPFC activity is critical for adaptive decision making, possibly by suppressing riskier responses. Anodal tDCS over DLPFC by itself did not significantly change risk-taking behaviors; however, when the contralateral DLPFC was modulated with cathodal tCDS, an important decrease in risk taking was observed. Also, the induced cautious decision-making behavior was observed only when activity of both DLPFCs was modulated.

The root mean square of sEMG and median frequency (Mf) of the sEMG power spectrum as well as the MEP area of ADM and BIC were calculated up to the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC).

The Mf of ADM peaked at 40% MVC to slowly decline thereafter. The MEP changes with force were similar to Mf changes. Thus, corticospinal output, as tested by the Mf and MEPs, does not parallel force increments across the contraction range. This decline, which is contingent on the relative contribution of motor unit recruitment and rate coding to force production in each muscle, may depend on reduced motoneurone responsiveness at high firing rates.

Because the two PAS sessions activate identical neuronal circuits, we conclude that 'homosynaptic-like' homeostatic mechanisms in accord with the BCM rule contribute to regulating plasticity in human M1.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "206", "title": "Pallidal stimulation modifies after-effects of paired associative stimulation on motor cortex excitability in primary generalised dystonia.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "12411225", "authors": ["Tisch, S", "Rothwell, JC", "Bhatia, KP", "Quinn, N", "Zrinzo, L", "Jahanshahi, M", "Ashkan, K", "Hariz, M", "Limousin, P"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "This article reviews methods that have been developed as part of a clinical initiative on improving outcome measures for motor function assessment in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Physiological motor outcome measures originally developed for limbs-transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and mechanical stimulation to elicit spinal reflexes-have been extended to muscles of the trunk. The impetus for this development is the lack of a motor component in the American Spinal Injury Association clinical assessment for the thoracic myotomes. The application of TMS to the assessment of limb muscles is reviewed, followed by consideration of its application to the assessment of paravertebral and intercostal muscles. Spinal reflex testing of paravertebral muscles is also described. The principal markers for the thoracic SCI motor level that have emerged from this clinical initiative are (1) the threshold of MEPs in paravertebral muscles in response to TMS of the motor cortex, (2) the facilitation pattern and latency of MEPs in intercostal muscles during voluntary expiratory effort, and (3) the absence of long-latency reflex responses and the exaggeration of short-latency reflex responses in paravertebral muscles.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation reveals inhibitory deficiency in migraine.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "12558545", "authors": ["Chadaide, Z", "Arlt, S", "Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Lang, N", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache", "abstract": "The paper presents the current state of the art of research identifying the neurophysiological and neuroanatomical substrates of private speech, both in typical and clinical (or atypical) populations. First, it briefly describes the evolution of private speech research, which goes from classic traditions as the naturalistic and referential paradigms to the neurocognitive approach. An overview of the neurophysiological (e.g., event-related potentials or ERPs) and neuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI) is also presented. The next three sections review empirical works about the neurocognitive basis of private speech, across three groups of techniques: ERPs; fMRI/MRI; and other neuroimaging techniques (positron emission tomography [PET], magnetoencephalogram [MEG], and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS]). Such neurocognitive research analyzes the neural activity of individuals during a variety of task settings, including spontaneous and instructed overt and inner private speech use, subvocal verbalizations, and silent and overt reading. The fifth section focuses on electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies of private speech in atypical populations, for example: schizophrenia, pure alexia, hearing impairment, blindness, social phobia, alexithymia, Parkinson, and multiple sclerosis. The neurocognitive study of the various forms of private speech appears to be very promising in the understanding of these pathologies.

More recently it has been shown that electromagnetic field (EMF) treatment aids bone healing, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) appears to be beneficial in treating schizophrenia and depression. Since external EMFs influence internal body processes, we hypothesized that measurement of body surface EMFs might be used to detect disease states and direct the course of subsequent therapy. However, measurement of minute body surface EMFs requires use of a sensitive and well documented magnetometer. In this study we evaluated the sensitivity and frequency response of a fluxgate magnetometer with a triaxial probe for use in detecting body surface EMF and we compared the magnetometer readings with a signal from a Toftness Sensometer, operated by an experienced clinician, in the laboratory and in a clinical setting.", "pages": "41-9"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Safety and tolerability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with epilepsy: a review of the literature.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "12734766", "authors": ["Bae, EH", "Schrader, LM", "Machii, K", "Alonso-Alonso, M", "Riviello, JJ", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Rotenberg, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "A Peavy Audio Amplifier and variable power output Telulex signal generator were used to develop 50 microT EMFs in a three coil Merritt coil system.

At frequencies other than 60 Hz, the field strength was maintained at 50 microT by adjusting the Telulex signal output to keep the current constant. The field generated was monitored using a 10 turn coil connected to an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope reading indicated that the field strength was the same at all frequencies tested. To determine if there was a correspondence between the signals detected by a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM1) and the Toftness Sensometer both devices were placed in the Merritt coil and readings were recorded from the FGM1 and compared with the ability of a highly experienced Toftness operator to detect the 50 microT field. Subsequently, in a clinical setting, FGM1 readings made by an FGM1 technician and Sensometer readings were made by 4 Toftness Sensometer operators, having various degrees of experience with this device. Each examiner obtained instrument readings from 5 different volunteers in separate chiropractic adjusting rooms.
