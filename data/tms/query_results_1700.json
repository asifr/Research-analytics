Temporal changes in force-related electromyographic activity were also assessed during active movement execution. In observation conditions in which a heavy object was lifted, M1-excitability was higher compared to conditions in which a light object was lifted. Both during observation and execution, differential force encoding tended to gradually increase from the grasping phase until the late lift phase. Surprisingly, however, during observation, force encoding was already present at the early reach phase: a time point at which no visual cues on the object's weight were available to the observer. As the observer was aware that the same weight condition was presented repeatedly, this finding may indicate that prior predictions concerning the upcoming weight condition are reflected by M1 excitability.

However, the neural mechanisms of TMS-induced activity are not well understood. Here, we introduce a novel method of imaging TMS-evoked activity using a non-invasive fast optical imaging tool, the event-related optical signal (EROS). EROS measures changes in the scattering of near-infrared light that occur synchronously with electrical activity in cortical tissue. EROS has good temporal and spatial resolution, allowing the dynamics and spatial spread of a TMS pulse to be measured. We used EROS to monitor activity induced in primary motor cortex (M1) by a TMS pulse. Left- and right-hand representations were mapped using standard TMS procedures. Optical sources and detectors mounted on thin rubber patches were then centered on M1 hand representations. EROS was recorded bilaterally from motor cortex while unilateral TMS was simultaneously delivered. Robust ipsilateral EROS activations were apparent within 16 ms of a pulse for TMS delivered to both left and right hemispheres. Clear motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also elicited by these TMS pulses. Movement artifacts could be excluded as a source of EROS, as no activation was present on short-distance optical channels. For left hemisphere TMS subsequent (40 ms) contralateral activity was also present, presumably due to trans-synaptic propagation of TMS-evoked activity.

While it has been assumed that early corrective actions arise from subcortical networks, recent research has prompted speculation about the potential role of cortical involvement. With reach to grasp reactions there is evidence of parallels in the control of perturbation-evoked reaching versus rapid voluntary reaching. However, the potential role of cortical involvement in such rapid balance reactions remains speculative. To test if cortical motor regions are involved we used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to temporarily suppress the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) in participants involved in two reaching conditions: (1) rapid compensatory perturbation-evoked reach to grasp and (2) voluntary reach to grasp in response to an auditory cue. We hypothesized that following cTBS to the left M1 hand area we would find diminished EMG responses in the reaching (right) hand for both compensatory and voluntary movements. To isolate balance reactions to the upper limb participants were seated in an elevated tilt-chair with a stable handle positioned in front of their right shoulder. The chair was held vertical by a magnet and triggered to fall backward randomly. To regain balance, participants were instructed to reach for the handle as quickly as possible with the right hand upon chair release. Intermixed with perturbation trials, participants were also required to reach for the same handle but in response to an auditory tone. Muscle activity was recorded from several muscles of the right arm/hand using electromyography. As expected, movement time and muscle onsets were much faster following perturbation versus auditory-cued reaching. The novel finding from our study was the reduced amplitude of hand muscle activity post-cTBS for both perturbation-cued and auditory-cued reaches. Moreover, this reduction was specific to the cTBS-targeted hand with no effect on remaining arm muscles. These findings support the idea that cortical networks contribute to both volitional and perturbation-evoked reaches and provide evidence for M1involvement in driving early arm responses toward a target following sudden loss of balance.", "pages": "503-13"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Modulating cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity with transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "16328307", "authors": ["Polan\u00eda, R", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use interleaved transcranial magnetic stimulation/functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS/fMRI) to investigate the effects of lamotrigine (LTG) and valproic acid (VPA) on effective connectivity within motor and corticolimbic circuits.

For precise analyses, single-pulse and double-pulse magnetic brainstem stimulation are performed to measure the cortical-brainstem conduction time and brainstem-spinal conduction time.

Compared with hearing individuals, deaf individuals were impaired only in tactile temporal processing. To explore the neural substrate of this difference, we ran a TMS experiment. In deaf individuals, the auditory association cortex was involved in temporal and spatial tactile processing, with the same chronometry as the primary somatosensory cortex. In hearing participants, the involvement of auditory association cortex occurred at a later stage and selectively for temporal discrimination.

Forty subjects received tracking training in the morning (n\u00a0=\u00a020) or the evening (n\u00a0=\u00a020). Measures of tracking skill and cortical excitability were collected before and after training. Following training, tracking skill and measures of cortical excitability were assessed at two additional follow-up visits (12 and 24\u00a0h post-training) for each subject following an episode of sleep or waking activity. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs with Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc tests were conducted for tracking accuracy and measures of cortical excitability. Skill performance improved after training and continued to develop offline during the first post-training interval (12\u00a0h). This development was not further enhanced by sleep during this interval. Level of skill improvement was maintained for at least one day in both training groups. Cortical excitability was reduced following training and was related to level of skill performance at follow-up assessment. These data suggest offline memory consolidation of a continuous, visuospatial, finger-tracking skill is not dependent on sleep.

However, the poor spatial resolution of EEG and the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to the activity of the underlying cortex limited the interpretation of these results. In order to better understand local cortical regulation of sleep, we used source modeling to show that plastic changes in specific cortical areas during waking produce correlated changes in SWA during sleep in those same areas. We found that implicit learning of a visuomotor adaptation task induced an increase in SWA in right premotor and sensorimotor cortices when compared to a motor control. These same areas have previously been shown to be selectively involved in the performance of this task. We also found that arm immobilization resulted in a decrease in SWA in sensorimotor cortex. Inducing cortical potentiation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) caused an increase in SWA in the targeted area and a decrease in SWA in the contralateral cortex. Finally, we report the first evidence that these modulations in SWA may be related to the dynamics of individual slow waves.

Both QPS-5 and QPS-50 enlarged a cortical component of the contralateral SEP during stimulation.

We have shown the unidirectional on-line effects evoked by QPS-5 and QPS-50 on both SEP and NIRS, and bidirectional after effects on SEP at the contralateral hemisphere. The discrepancy between on-line effect and after effect may be explained by the differences in the underlying mechanisms between them. The former may be mainly explained by pure electrophysiological property changes in the membrane or synapses. The latter may be explained by synaptic efficacy changes which need some protein syntheses at least partly. Another discrepancy shown here is the direction of on-line effects.

The left primary motor cortex of ten subjects was stimulated with 8-s repetitive TMS trains at 0.5, 1, and 2 Hz at an intensity of 75% of the resting motor threshold. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured with NIRS on the stimulated and contralateral hemispheres. The photoplethysmograph (PPG) amplitude and heart rate were recorded as well.

The brain stimulation reduced the total hemoglobin concentration (HbT) on the stimulated and contralateral hemispheres. The shoulder stimulation reduced HbT on the stimulated shoulder but increased it contralaterally. The waveforms of the HbT responses on the stimulated hemisphere and shoulder correlated strongly with each other (r\u200a=\u200a0.65-0.87). All circulatory parameters were also affected. The results suggest that the TMS-evoked NIRS signal includes components that do not result directly from cerebral neuronal activity. These components arise from local effects of TMS on the vasculature. Also global circulatory effects due to arousal may affect the responses.

Motor thresholds significantly increased in MP in LD and EL sessions, and remained stable in CS. There were no significant between-group differences in other measures of TMS.

In \"quiescent\" human sensorimotor regions, the main detectable oscillatory activity peaks at \u223c20 Hz, and partly contributes to determine the state of corticospinal excitability. Here, we showed that the transcranial application of an imperceptible, short-lasting (90 s) electric field oscillating at a physiological range increases corticospinal excitability online, with well defined frequency dependence and regional specificity. Indeed, the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by navigated single-pulse TMS over the motor cortex significantly increased only during the local application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 20 Hz (\u03b2 range). Other tACS frequencies (5, 10, and 40 Hz) applied on the motor cortex did not impact MEPs' size. Moreover, tACS applied on a control site (parietal cortex) and on a peripheral site (ulnar nerve) also failed to modulate MEPs.

In aphasia patients, suppression of right pars triangularis (PTr) led to significant increase in pictures named, and significant decrease in RT. Suppression of right pars opercularis (POp), however, led to significant increase in RT, but no change in number of pictures named.
