Transcranial magnetic stimulation data indicate that these movements reflect an abnormal enhancement of the \"physiological mirroring\" that can be observed in healthy adults during complex and effortful tasks. It was hypothesized that, in PD, enhanced mirroring is caused by a failure of basal ganglia output to support the cortical network that is responsible for the execution of strictly unimanual movements. If so, it is likely that subtle alterations of voluntary unimanual motor control are also present in PD patients without overt MM. We tested this hypothesis by using surface electromyographic (EMG) techniques in 12 mildly to moderately affected PD patients without overt MM, and in 2 control groups (12 age-matched and 10 young healthy volunteers). Subjects performed unilateral phasic thumb abduction during a sustained tonic contraction of the opposite abductor pollicis brevis. All patients were tested on dopaminergic therapy. On a separate day, 7 of 12 patients were re-tested after withdrawal of medication. During this task, involuntary mirror-like increase in surface EMG of the tonically abducting thumb was significantly larger in PD patients than in age-matched or young healthy volunteers. Off therapy, mirroring was slightly greater than on medication, although this difference was not significant. Our findings suggest that dysfunction of unimanual motor control is a general feature of PD. It is likely that this deficient movement lateralization contributes to an impairment of nonsymmetrical bimanual movements in PD.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "MEP latency shift after implantation of deep brain stimulation systems in the subthalamic nucleus in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "16703590", "authors": ["Hidding, U", "B\u00e4umer, T", "Siebner, HR", "Demiralay, C", "Buhmann, C", "Weyh, T", "Moll, C", "Hamel, W", "M\u00fcnchau, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a highly effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The consequences of STN stimulation on intracortical and corticospinal excitability have been addressed in a few studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Although excitability measurements were compared between the STN stimulation OFF and ON condition, in these experiments, there are no longitudinal studies examining the impact of electrode implantation per se on motor excitability. Here, we explored the effects of STN electrode implantation on resting motor thresholds (RMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves, and MEP onset latencies on 2 consecutive days before and shortly after STN surgery with the stimulator switched off, thus avoiding the effects of chronic DBS on the motor system, in 8 PD patients not taking any dopaminergic medication. After surgery, RMT and MEP recruitment curves were unchanged. In contrast, MEP onset latencies were significantly shorter when examined in relaxed muscles but were unchanged under preactivation. We hypothesize that postoperatively TMS pulses induced small currents in scalp leads underneath the TMS coil connecting the external stimulator with STN electrodes leading to inadvertent stimulation of fast-conducting descending neural elements in the vicinity of the STN, thereby producing submotor threshold descending volleys. These \"conditioning\" volleys probably preactivated spinal motor neurons leading to earlier suprathreshold activation by the multiple corticospinal volleys produced by TMS of the motor cortex. These TMS effects need to be considered when interpreting results of excitability measurements in PD patients after implantation of STN electrodes.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Opposite biases in salience-based selection for the left and right posterior parietal cortex.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16699505", "authors": ["Mevorach, C", "Humphreys, GW", "Shalev, L"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "Visual selection is determined in part by the saliency of stimuli.

In KD, the background electromyogram (EMG) and the motor evoked potential (MEP) area were both enhanced. However, neither the corticospinal efficiency (MEP gain, the ratio between MEP and background EMG) nor the duration of the SP differed from healthy subjects. In ALS patients, the MEP gain and the SP duration decreased conspicuously with time. We conclude that use of the MEP gain improves detection of corticospinal dysfunction in ALS patients.

High-frequency rTMS leads primarily to facilitation, whereas low-frequency rTMS leads to inhibition of the treated cortex. However, the contribution of rTMS train duration is less clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of nine different rTMS protocols, including low and high frequencies, as well as short and long applications (1, 3 and 10 Hz applied for 1, 5 and 20 min), on visual cortex excitability in anaesthetized and paralysed cats by means of visual evoked potential (VEP) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Our results show that 10 Hz rTMS applied for 1 and 5 min significantly enhanced early VEP amplitudes, while 1 and 3 Hz rTMS applied for 5 and 20 min significantly reduced them. No significant changes were found after 1 and 3 Hz rTMS applied for only 1 min, and 10 Hz rTMS applied for 20 min. EEG activity was only transiently (<20 s) affected, with increased delta activity after 1 and 3 Hz rTMS applied for 1 or 5 min. These findings indicate that the effects of rTMS on cortical excitability depend on the combination of stimulus frequency and duration (or total number of stimuli): short high-frequency trains seem to be more effective than longer trains, and low-frequency rTMS requires longer applications.

As there are no consistent structural disturbances, clinical neurophysiology methods seem particularly suited to study its pathophysiology. This chapter will focus on a review of neurophysiological studies that have provided an insight into migraine pathogenesis. The results are in part contradictory, which may be due to the methodology, patient selection or timing of study. Nonetheless, quantitative electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings during migraine attacks provide strong, though indirect, evidence favouring the occurrence of spreading cortical depression during attacks of migraine with, and possibly without, aura. Evoked cortical potential and nociceptive blink reflex studies demonstrate that lack of habituation during repetitive stimulation is a reproducible CNS dysfunction interictally in both migraine with and without aura. Transcranial magnetic stimulations show excitability changes of the visual cortex. The interictal migrainous CNS dysfunction is likely to play a role in migraine pathogenesis, has a familial character and undergoes periodic modulations with quasi-normalisation just before, during an attack and after treatment with certain prophylactic agents. In addition, neurophysiological methods have revealed subclinical abnormalities of cerebellar function and neuromuscular transmission, which may improve phenotyping of migraineurs for genetic and therapeutic studies.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Pregabalin exerts oppositional effects on different inhibitory circuits in human motor cortex: a double-blind, placebo-controlled transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "10492813", "authors": ["Lang, N", "Sueske, E", "Hasan, A", "Paulus, W", "Tergau, F"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Epilepsia", "abstract": "To explore acute effects of pregabalin (PGB) on human motor cortex excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "The treatment of recurring auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia with rTMS.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10751273", "authors": ["Fitzgerald, PB", "Benitez, J", "Daskalakis, JZ", "De Castella, A", "Kulkarni, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry", "abstract": "PGB, 600 mg/day, was orally administered in 19 healthy subjects twice daily in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design.

In the first experiment, 12 healthy control subjects were randomly assigned to receive regular 1, 10 or 20 Hz rTMS in a counterbalanced order with sessions separated by at least 1 week. In the second experiment, 10 of these 12 subjects received priming rTMS (600 stimuli at 6 Hz followed by 600 stimuli at 1 Hz). Cortical inhibition was indexed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Corticospinal excitability was indexed using motor threshold and MEP amplitude. We found no significant overall change in SICI, although there was a significant correlation between changes in SICI with baseline SICI. Subjects with greater SICI at baseline tended to have reduction in SICI post-rTMS, whereas subjects with less SICI tended to have increase in SICI post-rTMS. There was also a significant lengthening of the CSP with higher stimulation frequencies compared to lower stimulation frequencies.

The aim of this study was to investigate if the previously reported task-dependent modulation of the M2 is specific to the M2 or can be explained by an early release of the intended voluntary response. We took advantage of the fact that the M2 is absent when the duration of the applied perturbation is less than a critical time period. This allowed us to examine modulation of muscle activity with and without the contribution of the M2. In addition, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex to examine the modulation of corticomotor excitability with task instruction. Elbow joint extension displacements were used to elicit a stretch reflex in the biceps muscle. Subjects were instructed to \"do not intervene\" (DNI) with the applied perturbation, or to oppose the perturbation by activating the elbow flexors in response to the perturbation (FLEX). Electromyographic (EMG) activity in the time period corresponding to the M2 was significantly facilitated in the FLEX task instruction both with and without the presence of the M2. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS were also facilitated during the FLEX condition in the absence of the M2. EMG and MEP responses were not facilitated until immediately prior to the onset of the M2. Paired-pulse TMS revealed a significant reduction in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) during the M2 response, but the level of SICI was not altered by the task instruction. We conclude that the task-dependent modulation of the biceps M2 results, at least in part, from an early release of the prepared movement and is accompanied by an increase in corticospinal excitability that is not specific to the M2 pathway. Task-dependent modulation of the response cannot be explained by an alteration in the excitability of intracortical inhibitory circuits.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "Masking visual stimuli by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "15760946", "authors": ["Kammer, T"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Psychological research", "abstract": "Although there is some early evidence showing the value of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in stroke rehabilitation, the therapeutic effect of high-frequency rTMS, along with the physiology of rTMS-induced corticomotor excitability supporting motor learning in stroke, has not been established.

We investigated the effect of 10 min of intermittent rTMS on motor cortical excitability in normal subjects at two frequencies (2 or 6 Hz). Three low intensities of stimulation (70, 80, and 90% of active motor threshold) and sham stimulation were used. The number of stimuli were matched between conditions. Motor cortical excitability was investigated by measurement of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) evoked by single magnetic stimuli in the relaxed first dorsal interosseus muscle. The intensity of the single stimuli was set to evoke baseline MEPs of approximately 1 mV in amplitude. Both 2- and 6-Hz stimulation, at 80% of active motor threshold, reduced the magnitude of MEPs for approximately 30 min (P < 0.05). MEPs returned to baseline values after a weak voluntary contraction. Stimulation at 70 and 90% of active motor threshold and sham stimulation did not induce a significant group effect on MEP magnitude. However, the intersubject response to rTMS at 90% of active motor threshold was highly variable, with some subjects showing significant MEP facilitation and others inhibition.

When study participants control a cursor by manipulating a tool held freely between the hands, the left hand becomes prime actor if the cursor moves directionally with the left-hand forces, whereas the right hand primarily acts if it moves with the opposing right-hand forces. In neurophysiological (electromyography, transcranial magnetic brain stimulation) and functional magnetic resonance brain imaging experiments we demonstrate that changes in hand assignment parallels a midline shift of lateralized activity in distal hand muscles, corticospinal pathways, and primary sensorimotor and cerebellar cortical areas. We conclude that the two hands can readily exchange roles as dominant actor in bimanual tasks.

The contribution of S1 was confirmed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): accuracy in comparing the frequency of two sequential vibrations was reduced by a single TMS pulse delivered to S1 in the interval between the two vibrations. More recent experiments have revealed that participants use the velocity (or energy) of the stimulus when judging its frequency. This is consistent with a contribution from S1: electrophysiological recording in S1 cortex of rats shows that neurons in S1 do not explicitly code vibration frequency, but instead code the product of frequency and amplitude (proportional to the mean velocity or energy of the vibration). Further, frequency discrimination is reduced by the addition of even very small amounts of noise to the temporal structure of the vibrations (making them irregular). However, noise has no effect if the two vibrations are presented on opposite fingertips (i.e. beyond the range of receptive field sizes of neurons in S1), or if there is no difference in their velocity.

The relation between visual masking and the generation of phosphenes is discussed as well as the underlying physiological mechanisms.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Selective and nonselective benzodiazepine agonists have different effects on motor cortex excitability.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16679502", "authors": ["Mohammadi, B", "Krampfl, K", "Petri, S", "Bogdanova, D", "Kossev, A", "Bufler, J", "Dengler, R"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to determine whether motor cortex excitability assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is less variable when subjects maintain a visually controlled low-level contraction of the muscle of interest. We also examined the dependence of single motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude on stimulation intensity and pre-stimulus muscle activation level using linear and non-linear multiple regression analysis. Eight healthy adult subjects received single pulse TMS over the left motor cortex at a point where minimal stimulation intensity was required to produce MEPs in extensor digitorum communis (EDC). Voluntary activation of the muscle was controlled by visual display of a target force (indicated by a stable line on an oscilloscope) and the isometric force produced as the subject attempted to extend the fingers (indicated by a line on the oscilloscope representing the finger extension force) while subjects were instructed to: exert zero extension force (0%) and produce forces equal to 5 and 10% of maximum voluntary finger extension under separate conditions. Relative variability (coefficient of variation) of single MEPs at a constant stimulus intensity and of pre-stimulus muscle EMG was lower during maintained 5 and 10% contractions than at 0% contraction levels. Therefore, maintaining a stable low intensity contraction helps stabilize cortical and spinal excitability. Multiple regression analyses showed that a linear dependence of single MEPs on stimulation intensity and pre-stimulus muscle activation level produced similar fits to those for a non-linear dependence on stimulus intensity and a linear dependence on pre-stimulus EMG. Thus, a simple linear method can be used to assess dependence of single MEP amplitudes on both stimulus intensity (to characterize slope of the recruitment curve) and low intensity background muscle activation level.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "Excitability changes in human hand motor area induced by voluntary teeth clenching are dependent on muscle properties.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16679059", "authors": ["Takahashi, M", "Ni, Z", "Yamashita, T", "Liang, N", "Sugawara, K", "Yahagi, S", "Kasai, T"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It also leads to a significant economic burden due to workdays lost, reduced productivity, and long-term use of medications with their associated side effects. Despite the availability of several therapeutic options, the management of patients with CAVP is often inadequate, resulting in frustration for both patients and physicians. This may in part be explained by the lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying chronic pain; in contrast with acute pain in which the pathophysiology is relatively well known and has several satisfactory therapeutic options. Recently, the development of tools for brain investigation, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, has provided new insights on the pathophysiology of chronic pain. These new data have shown that plastic changes in the central and peripheral nervous system might play an important role in the maintenance of chronic pain. Therefore, approaches aimed at the modulation of the nervous system, rather than the ones interfering with the inflammatory pathways, may be more effective for chronic pain treatment. We propose that noninvasive central nervous system stimulation, with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), might be a novel therapeutic option for CAVP.

These parallel circuits may originate from areas such as the contralateral, undamaged primary motor area, bilateral premotor areas, bilateral supplementary motor areas, bilateral somatosensory areas, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. Most importantly, the efferent, cortico-spinal output pathways must be preserved for a desired behavioral result. Most of the recovery of function after a stroke may represent actual relearning of the skills with the injured brain. The main neural mechanisms underlying this relearning process after stroke involve shifts of distributed contributions across a specific neural network (fundamentally the network engaged in skill learning in the healthy). If these notions are indeed correct, then neuromodulatory approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, targeting these parallel circuits might be useful to limit injury and promote recovery after a stroke.

We found that mean reaction times and error rates increased with angle of rotation depending on the actual biomechanical constraints of the hand but suprathreshold TMS had no influence on task performance regardless of the timing of TMS. However, the excitability of the corticomotor output from the left M1-HAND was modulated during the reaction. Judging left hand drawings was associated with an attenuation of motor-evoked potentials 300-100 ms before the response, whereas judging right hand drawings facilitated the motor-evoked potentials only immediately before the response. These effects were the same for pictures of backs and palms and were independent of the angle of rotation. The failure of TMS to affect task performance suggests that there is no time window during which the M1-HAND makes a critical contribution to mental rotation of the hand.

When rTMS was applied several times per day, i.e. four blocks of 5 min rTMS each followed 5 min later by a 3-min training block and 15-min intervals between these blocks (experiment A), animals reached a high discrimination performance more slowly over 5 days than did controls.

Stimulation of FEF 20-40 ms prior to stimulation of MT/V5 decreased the intensity of MT/V5 stimulation required to elicit phosphenes: TMS of the right FEF changed the sensitivity of left and right MT/V5 whereas TMS of the left FEF changed the sensitivity only of the left MT/V5. Thus, the sensitivity of human extrastriate cortex is modulated by activity in the FEF.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Increased mirror movements after epileptic seizure in a case of polymicrogyria.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10803416", "authors": ["Sahin, S", "Tan, D", "Aydin, S", "Kiziltan, M", "Karsidag, S"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The neurologist", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate in humans the effects of acupuncture upon upper-limb motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex. It is known that peripheral sensory stimulation can be used to induce short- and long-term changes in motor cortex excitability. Data show that the simple insertion of the needle is an adequate somatosensory stimulus to induce a significant modulation of MEP amplitude, the sign of which (facilitation or inhibition) is specific to the investigated muscle and to the point of needle insertion. Moreover, MEP changes in upper-limb muscles are also observed following needling of lower-limb sites, revealing the presence of long-distance effects of acupuncture. Finally, the modulation in muscle excitability considerably outlasts the time period of needle application, demonstrating the induction of long-term plastic changes in the central nervous system. In addition, results have shown that the effects on muscle excitability are not restricted to the stimulation of well-coded acupoints, as described in traditional Chinese medicine, but they can also be induced by needling of nonacupoints, normally not used for therapeutic purposes. The possible neuronal mechanisms underlying the observed effects of acupuncture are discussed in relation to the available neurophysiological data regarding the interlimb reflexes and the changes in the representational cortical maps induced in humans by a prolonged somatosensory stimulation.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Lack of inhibitory interaction between somatosensory afferent inputs and intracortical inhibitory interneurons in focal hand dystonia.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "10860416", "authors": ["Simonetta-Moreau, M", "Louren\u00e7o, G", "Sangla, S", "Mazieres, L", "Vidailhet, M", "Meunier, S"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "1. Muscle fatigue can be defined as any exercise-induced loss of ability to produce force with a muscle or muscle group. It involves processes at all levels of the motor pathway between the brain and the muscle. Central fatigue represents the failure of the nervous system to drive the muscle maximally. It is defined as a progressive exercise-induced reduction in voluntary activation or neural drive to the muscle. Supraspinal fatigue is a component of central fatigue. It can be defined as an exercise-induced decline in force caused by suboptimal output from the motor cortex. 2. When stimulus intensity is set appropriately, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex during an isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the elbow flexors commonly evokes a small twitch-like increment in flexion force. This increment indicates that, despite the subject's maximal effort, motor cortical output at the moment of stimulation was not maximal and was not sufficient to drive the motoneurons to produce maximal force from the muscle. An exercise-induced increase in this increment demonstrates supraspinal fatigue. 3. Supraspinal fatigue has been demonstrated during fatiguing sustained and intermittent maximal and submaximal contractions of the elbow flexors where it accounts for about one-quarter of the loss of force of fatigue. It is linked to activity and the development of fatigue in the tested muscles and is little influenced by exercise performed by other muscles. 4. The mechanisms of supraspinal fatigue are unclear. Although changes in the behaviour of cortical neurons and spinal motoneurons occur during fatigue, they can be dissociated from supraspinal fatigue. One factor that may contribute to supraspinal fatigue is the firing of fatigue-sensitive muscle afferents that may act to impair voluntary descending drive.", "pages": "1461-5"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Motor and visual cortical excitability in migraineurs patients with or without aura: transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10912829", "authors": ["Khedr, EM", "Ahmed, MA", "Mohamed, KA"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Research has shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) results in a transient reduction in the experience of chronic pain. The present research aimed to investigate whether a single session of high frequency TMS is able to change the sensory thresholds of individuals suffering from chronic pain. Detection and pain thresholds for cold and heat sensations were measured before and after 20Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) administered over the motor cortex. A significant decrease in temperature for cold detection and pain thresholds and a significant increase in temperature for heat pain thresholds were evident following a single session of rTMS. In contrast, no change in detection and pain thresholds was obtained following sham rTMS. The finding that rTMS can have a direct effect on sensory thresholds in individuals suffering from chronic pain has implications for the therapeutic use of rTMS in the relief of chronic pain.", "pages": "1461-5"}]
