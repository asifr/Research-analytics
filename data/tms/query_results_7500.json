Stimulation of the common peroneal nerve at the fibula head at the threshold of the alpha motoneuron axons resulted in inhibition of the soleus (SOL) H reflex at a conditioning-test interval of 2 ms. Magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex resulted in complex modulations of the SOL H reflex, including a short latency facilitation followed by inhibition. This inhibition may have been conveyed by Ia inhibitory interneurons projecting to SOL motoneurons. To test for convergence, whether or not the magnetic stimulation was capable of facilitating disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition of the SOL H reflex induced by stimulation of the peroneal nerve, the two stimuli were given together or separately. We observed the inhibition significantly increased when the two stimuli were given together than separately. These results suggest that the Ia inhibitory interneurons projecting to SOL motoneurons in humans might receive convergent input from the motor area of the brain and from Ia afferents of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in humans as well as in other animals.", "pages": "429-32"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Transcranial magnetic brain stimulation: a tool to investigate central motor pathways.", "issue": "", "pmid": "11719609", "authors": ["R\u00f6sler, KM"], "year": "2001", "journal": "News in physiological sciences : an international journal of physiology produced jointly by the International Union of Physiological Sciences and the American Physiological Society", "abstract": "Cortical silent period (SP) of the limb muscles is thought to reflect the cortical excitability.

Rapid, repeated pulses can disrupt activity for correspondingly longer periods.

It was characterized by predominantly distal, semi-continuous rhythmic myoclonus (all patients), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (all patients) and complex partial seizures (three patients). Most individuals had rarely suffered seizures and had a normal cognitive level, but three individuals with intractable seizures had mild mental retardation. The pattern of inheritance was autosomal dominant with high penetrance. We defined this disorder as autosomal dominant cortical myoclonus and epilepsy (ADCME). All patients had frontotemporal as well as generalized interictal EEG abnormalities. A neurophysiological study of the myoclonus suggested a cortical origin. Back-averaging of the data generated a series of waves with a frequency that mirrored the frequency of EMG bursts. Frequency analysis identified significant peaks with coherence between EMG and EEG, which were recorded over the contralateral rolandic area in five patients. The frequency of coherence was 8-25 Hz and phase spectra confirmed that EEG activity preceded EMG activity by 8-15 ms. In two individuals there was also significant coherence between the ipsilateral EEG and EMG, consistent with the transcallosal spread of myoclonic activity. The C-reflex at rest was enhanced and somatosensory and visual evoked potentials were of high amplitude. The resting motor threshold intensity to transcranial magnetic stimulation was significantly reduced (38%; SD +/- 7; P = 0.01) and the post-motor evoked potential silent period (101 ms; SEM +/- 10) was significantly shortened compared with the controls (137 ms; SEM +/- 18). These clinical and neuro- physiological characteristics suggest diffuse cortical hyperexcitability and high propensity for intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric cortical spread, as well as rhythmic myoclonic activity. Genome-wide linkage analysis identified a critical region spanning 12.4 cM between markers D2S2161 and D2S1897 in 2p11.1-q12.2, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.46 at Theta 0.0 for marker D2S2175. Multipoint LOD score values, reaching 3.74 around D2S2175, localize the ADCME gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 2. The exclusion of the locus for familial adult myoclonic epilepsy on chromosome 8q23.3-q24 from linkage to our family and the new localization of the responsible gene to chromosome 2cen, together with the different phenotype, define a new epilepsy syndrome.

The lack of TMS effects on the Hoffman's reflex (HR), at those intervals revealing the reduced inhibition in PD patients, is compatible with a supraspinal origin of the observed MEP abnormalities.

Spinal excitability, as judged by effects on the H-reflex or on transcranial anodal facilitation of the H-reflex, was not affected by the rTMS. However, cortical excitability, as judged by the effect on the size of EMG responses evoked by a suprathreshold TMS pulse, was decreased for up to 1 s after the end of rTMS. Post-train suppression was more powerful following longer trains or higher frequencies of rTMS. The predominant suppression contrasts with previous reports of facilitation, particularly after high-frequency rTMS. A second set of experiments, however, showed that this could be converted into facilitation if the intensity of rTMS was increased. We conclude that the after-effects of rTMS depend on its frequency, intensity and duration. The results are consistent with a model in which inhibition and facilitation build up gradually during the course of a conditioning train. Inhibition reaches its maximum effect after only a small number of stimuli, whereas facilitation takes longer. The threshold for evoking inhibition is lower than that for facilitation. Thus if moderate intensities of conditioning train are applied, inhibition is predominant after short trains, whereas facilitation dominates after long trains.", "pages": "429-32"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "The influence of current direction on phosphene thresholds evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "11682355", "authors": ["Kammer, T", "Beck, S", "Erb, M", "Grodd, W"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine whether humans' judgments about the speed and direction of moving stimuli was differentially affected by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

The physical stimulation (visual and TMS) was identical on the two tasks, as was discriminability (d') when TMS was not applied. We found significant criterion (beta) shifts on the speed discrimination task at both stimulation sites. Specifically, on TMS trials the proportion of \"slower\" judgments increased significantly, consistent with subjective reports that stimuli often appeared to slow when TMS was applied. The subjective reports indicated no corresponding change in perceived direction. We also found that speed discriminability was impaired significantly more than direction discriminability, but only when TMS was applied medially. Indeed, after controlling for TMS-related changes in reaction time, speed discriminability was impaired significantly, while direction discriminability remained largely intact.

In the first step of the experiment, based on previous findings, we investigated remarkable functional differences between intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles during complex finger tasks (precision and power grip). During the performance of the tasks, the optimal stimulus intensity of the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the contralateral motor cortex. MEPs of the FDI, extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles were recorded simultaneously with increased background EMG activity step by step in both tasks. The intensity threshold of TMS was lower in the precision grip. Furthermore, the MEP amplitudes of FDI muscle dependent on the background EMG activity were different between these two tasks, i.e., MEP amplitudes and regression coefficients in a precision grip were larger than those in a power grip. Although our results for MEP amplitude and threshold in the FDI muscle were similar to previous reported evidence, the different contributions of a synergistic muscle (in particular, the ECR muscle) during performance in these tasks was new evidence. Since there were no differences in cutaneous afferent effects on both tasks, corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells connected to FDI motoneurons seemed generally to be more active during precision than power gripping, and there were different contributions from synergistic muscles during the performance of these tasks. In the second part of the experiment, the results obtained from the complex tasks were compared with those from a simple task (isolated index finger flexion). MEP amplitudes, dependent on the background EMG activity during isolated index finger flexion, varied among subjects, i.e., the relationship between the MEP amplitude and the background EMG of the FDI muscle showed individual, strategy-dependent modulation. There were several kinds of individual motor strategies for performing the isolated finger movement.

We found three effects of TMS on eye-head movements: 1. Saccadic latency effect. When stimulation took place shortly before movements commenced (75-25 ms before), significantly shorter latencies were found between predictive target presentation and initiation of saccades. Eye latencies were significantly decreased by 45 ms on average, but head latencies were not. 2. Gaze amplitude effect. Without TMS, for the 60 degrees target amplitudes, head movements usually preceded eye movements, as expected (predictive gaze type 3). With TMS 5-75 ms before the gaze movement, the number of eye movements preceding head movements by 20-50 ms was significantly increased (p < 0.001) and the delay between eye and head movements was reversed (p < 0.001), i.e. we found eye-predictive gaze type 1. 3. Saccadic peak velocity effect. For TMS 5-25 s before the start of head movement, mean peak velocity of synkinetic eye saccades increased by 20-30% up to 600 degrees/s, compared to 350-400 degrees/s without TMS.

TMS was applied over the left primary motor cortex (M1) of healthy volunteers, intermixing single suprathreshold pulses with pairs of sub- and suprathreshold pulses and simultaneously recording EEG from 60 scalp electrodes. Averaging of EEG data time locked to the onset of TMS pulses yielded a waveform consisting of a positive peak (30 ms after the pulse P30), followed by two negative peaks [at 45 (N45) and 100 ms]. Peak-to-peak amplitude of the P30-N45 waveform was high, ranging from 12 to 70 microV; in most subjects, the N45 potential could be identified in single EEG traces. Spectral analysis revealed that single-pulse TMS induced a brief period of synchronized activity in the beta range (15-30 Hz) in the vicinity of the stimulation site; again, this oscillatory response was apparent not only in the EEG averages but also in single traces. Both the N45 and the oscillatory response were lower in amplitude in the 12-ms (but not 3-ms) paired-pulse trials, compared with the single-pulse trials. These findings are consistent with the possibility that TMS applied to M1 induces transient synchronization of spontaneous activity of cortical neurons within the 15- to 30-Hz frequency range.

Previous studies in the anesthetized macaque monkey suggested that, compared with the cat, the transmission of such excitation via a system of C3-C4 propriospinal neurons may be relatively weak. However, it is possible that in the anesthetized preparation, propriospinal transmission of cortical inputs to motoneurons may be depressed. To address this issue, the current study investigated the responses of single motor units (SMUs) to corticospinal inputs in either awake (n = 1) or lightly sedated (n = 3) macaque monkeys. Recordings in the awake state were made during performance of a precision grip task. The responses of spontaneously discharging SMUs to electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract (PT) via chronically implanted electrodes were examined for evidence of non-monosynaptic, presumed propriospinal, effects. Single PT stimuli (up to 250 microA; duration, 0.2 ms, 2 Hz) were delivered during steady discharge of the SMU (10-30 imp/s). SMUs were recorded from muscles acting on the thumb (adductor pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis, n = 18), wrist (extensor carpi radialis, n = 29) and elbow (biceps, n = 9). In all SMUs, the poststimulus time histograms to PT stimulation consisted of a single peak at a fixed latency and with a brief duration [0.74 +/- 0.25 (SD) ms, n = 56], consistent with the responses being mediated by monosynaptic action of cortico-motoneuronal (CM) impulses. Later peaks, indicating non-monosynaptic action, were not present even when the probability of the initial peak response was low and when there was no evidence for suppression of ongoing SMU activity following this peak (n = 20 SMUs). Even when repetitive (double-pulse) PT stimuli were used to facilitate transmission through oligosynaptic linkages, no later peaks were observed (16 SMUs). In some thumb muscle SMUs (n = 8), responses to PT stimulation were compared with those evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation, using a figure-eight coil held over the motor cortex. Responses varied according the orientation of the coil: in the latero-medial position, single peak responses similar to those from the PT were obtained; their latencies confirmed direct excitation of CM cells, and there were no later peaks. In the posterio-anterior orientation, responses had longer latencies and consisted of two to three subpeaks. At least under the conditions that we have tested, the results provide no positive evidence for transmission of cortical excitation to upper limb motoneurons by non-monosynaptic pathways in the macaque monkey.", "pages": "429-32"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "Prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as add on treatment in depression.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10466148", "authors": ["Garc\u00eda-Toro, M", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Romera, M", "Gonz\u00e1lez, A", "Mic\u00f3, J", "Ibarra, O", "Arnillas, H", "Capllonch, I", "Mayol, A", "Tormos, JM"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "There is considerable neurobiological evidence suggesting that schizophrenia is associated with reduced corticocortical connectivity.

These pathologies generally were expressed only when input information was ambiguous and provide models for delusions and cognitive disorganization.

Excessive pruning caused the network to produce percepts spontaneously, that is, in the absence of inputs, thereby simulating hallucinations.

A parallel study of human patients found similar impairments when comparing hallucinating patients with nonhallucinating patients. In addition, the authors have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to directly probe speech perception neurocircuitry in patients with these hallucinations.

Since VNS attenuates seizures in animal models, the treatment was initially developed and approved by the FDA for treatment of drug-resistant partial-onset epilepsy. Additional data, including the known neuroanatomy of the vagus nerve, effects of VNS on monoamines and mood improvement in patients with epilepsy who were treated with VNS, provided a rationale for further investigation in patients with primary mood disorders.

Similar to findings in epilepsy and in contrast to the usual results of long-term medication trials, longer term data regarding symptomatic and functional outcomes of depressed patients receiving VNS continue to look promising.

It may arise not only because of peripheral changes at the level of the muscle, but also because the central nervous system fails to drive the motoneurons adequately. Evidence for \"central\" fatigue and the neural mechanisms underlying it are reviewed, together with its terminology and the methods used to reveal it. Much data suggest that voluntary activation of human motoneurons and muscle fibers is suboptimal and thus maximal voluntary force is commonly less than true maximal force. Hence, maximal voluntary strength can often be below true maximal muscle force. The technique of twitch interpolation has helped to reveal the changes in drive to motoneurons during fatigue. Voluntary activation usually diminishes during maximal voluntary isometric tasks, that is central fatigue develops, and motor unit firing rates decline. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex during fatiguing exercise has revealed focal changes in cortical excitability and inhibitability based on electromyographic (EMG) recordings, and a decline in supraspinal \"drive\" based on force recordings. Some of the changes in motor cortical behavior can be dissociated from the development of this \"supraspinal\" fatigue. Central changes also occur at a spinal level due to the altered input from muscle spindle, tendon organ, and group III and IV muscle afferents innervating the fatiguing muscle. Some intrinsic adaptive properties of the motoneurons help to minimize fatigue. A number of other central changes occur during fatigue and affect, for example, proprioception, tremor, and postural control.

In human subjects, a high-voltage electrical pulse between electrodes fixed over the mastoid processes activates descending tract axons at the level of the cervico-medullary junction to produce motor responses (cevicomedullary evoked responses; CMEPs) in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles. 2. During isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the elbow flexors, CMEPs in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles are sometimes followed by a second compound muscle action potential. This response can be observed in single trials (amplitude of up to 60 % of the maximal M wave) and follows the CMEP by about 16 ms in both muscles. The response only occurs during very strong voluntary contractions. 3. The second response following transmastoid stimulation appears with stimulation intensities that are at the threshold for evoking a CMEP in the contracting muscles. The response grows with increasing stimulus intensity, but then decreases in amplitude and finally disappears at high stimulation intensities. 4. A single stimulus to the brachial plexus during MVCs can also elicit a second response (following the M wave) in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles. The latency of this response is 3-4 ms longer than that of the second response observed following transmastoid stimulation. This difference in latency is consistent with a reflex response to stimulation of large-diameter afferents. 5. The amplitude of the second response to transmastoid stimulation can be reduced by appropriately timed subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimuli. This result is consistent with intracortical inhibition of the response. 6. We suggest that transmastoid stimulation can elicit a large transcortical reflex response in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles.

Compared to the growing number of clinical studies on its putative therapeutic properties, the studies on the basic mechanisms of rTMS are surprisingly scarce. rTMS currently still awaits clinical routine administration although,there is compelling evidence that it causes changes in neuronal circuits as reflected by behavioural changes and decreases in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system.
