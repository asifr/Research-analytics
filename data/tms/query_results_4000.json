Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over ventral premotor cortex (vPMc) impairs visual discrimination of body actions. Although studies suggest that the action observation-execution matching system may map only actions that belong to the observer's motor repertoire, we demonstrated comparable motor and premotor facilitation during observation of biomechanically possible as well as impossible actions. It has also been shown that seeing impossible body movements activates the extrastriate body area (EBA). Using event-related rTMS, we sought to determine whether vPMc and EBA are actively involved in the visual discrimination of actions performed through biomechanically possible or impossible kinematics and of their biomechanical plausibility. Stimulation of vPMc impaired discrimination of possible actions while leaving intact the discrimination of biomechanically impossible actions and of biomechanical plausibility. No effect of EBA rTMS on any type of action processing was found. Thus, vPMc is crucial for discrimination of the goal of actions that can be actually performed suggesting that this area is involved in the visual processing of goal-directed actions.", "pages": "388-400"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Release of premotor activity after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of prefrontal cortex.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "18979382", "authors": ["Gangitano, M", "Mottaghy, FM", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Social neuroscience", "abstract": "In the present study we aimed to explore by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) the reciprocal influences between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and premotor cortex (PMC).

This suggests that factors that alter MEP size, such as changes in cortical excitability, may confound the interpretation of SICI. However, the effect of excitability on SICI has not been systematically investigated. The present study examined SICI in 11 volunteers. The effect of test TMS intensities ranging from 90 to 150% resting motor threshold (RMT) on SICI was examined in three excitability states in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle: rest, isometric abduction of the left index finger (Contra) and isometric abduction of the right index finger (Active). For all excitability states SICI was not observed when test TMS intensity was less than 110% resting motor threshold. This was true even for the Active condition in which 90 and 100% test TMS intensities elicited large and consistent MEPs. For all conditions moderately suprathreshold test TMS intensities (110-120% RMT) yielded the greatest measure of SICI; increasing test TMS intensities resulted in a progressive reduction in the estimate of SICI. These results suggest that estimates of SICI are systematically affected by the intensity of the test TMS pulse, regardless of excitability state.

In two experiments, we used visual priming and adaptation to modulate the initial activation state of the left PPC prior to application of TMS. In the priming experiment, TMS was applied over the left PPC during the delay between the prime and the target stimulus on each experimental trial. Left PPC TMS reversed the effects of priming by facilitating the detection of non-primed letters, whereas detection of primed letters was unaffected. As neurons tuned to non-primed letters were less active at the time of TMS application than neurons tuned to the primed letters, this finding demonstrates that TMS preferentially facilitates the detection of attributes encoded by the less active neural populations. A similar facilitation of the less active neural populations was observed when adaptation was used to suppress letter-selective neurons prior to application of TMS. Our study demonstrates that TMS-priming and TMS-adaptation paradigms can reveal letter selectivity in the left PPC and thus be useful in the study of language processes.

Motor resonance was measured as the modulation of excitability of spinal motoneurones, evoked by the observation of a cyclic flexion-extension of one hand. The first two experiments showed that the observation of a one-hand movement always evoked a bimanual resonant response independent of which hand was observed and that these bilateral responses were consistently phase-linked. H-reflexes simultaneously recorded in right and left flexor carpi radialis muscles were always modulated 'in-phase' with each other. The goal of the third experiment was to define the role of primary motor cortex in the bilateral resonant response. Bilateral H-reflexes were recorded during a temporary inactivation induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left cortical hand motor area of observers. The finding that such cortical depression abolished the H-reflex modulation of only the right flexor carpi radialis motoneurones, leaving it unchanged on the left side, suggested that both primary motor areas were activated by the premotor cortex and transmit the resonant activation through crossed corticospinal pathways.

During walking and tonic contraction of ankle dorsiflexors and knee extensors while standing [at matched electromyography (EMG) levels], the effect of common peroneal nerve (CPN) stimulation on quadriceps motoneurones was tested by assessing averaged and rectified EMG activity, H-reflexes [evoked by femoral nerve (FN) stimulation] and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The biphasic EMG facilitation (CPQ-reflex) produced by isolated CPN stimulation was enhanced during walking, and when CPN stimulation was combined with FN or TMS, the resulting H-reflexes and MEPs were inhibited. The CPQ-reflex was also depressed when CPN stimulation was combined with subthreshold TMS. The peripheral (in CPN and FN) and corticospinal volleys may activate inhibitory non-reciprocal group I interneurones, masking spinal excitations to quadriceps motoneurones mediated by propriospinal-like interneurones. It is proposed that the enhanced CPQ-reflex produced by isolated CPN stimulation during walking cannot be fully explained by an increase in corticospinal and peripheral inputs, but is more likely caused by central facilitation of the propriospinal-like interneurones from other sources.

But how does the brain coordinate the selection of such different stimulus characteristics? Neuroimaging studies have revealed significant regions of overlapping activity in frontoparietal cortex during attention to locations and features, suggesting a global component to visual selection (Vandenberghe et al., 2001; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Giesbrecht et al., 2003; Slagter et al., 2007).

Here we probed the balance between specialized and generalized control by interrupting preparatory attention in the human parietal cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that stimulation of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) impaired spatial attention only, whereas TMS of the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) disrupted spatial and feature-based attention.

The aim of this noncontrolled pilot study was to assess the feasibility and the effects of 1-Hz rTMS, known to have an inhibitory effect, on poststroke dysphagia. Seven patients (3 females, age = 65 +/- 10 years), with poststroke dysphagia due to hemispheric or subhemispheric stroke more than 6 months earlier (56 +/- 50 months) diagnosed by videofluoroscopy, participated in the study. rTMS at 1 Hz was applied for 20 min per day every day for 5 days to the healthy hemisphere to decrease transcallosal inhibition. The evaluation was performed using the dysphagia handicap index and videofluoroscopy. The dysphagia handicap index demonstrated that the patients had mild oropharyngeal dysphagia. Initially, the score was 43 +/- 9 of a possible 120 which decreased to 30 +/- 7 (p < 0.05) after rTMS.

Changes in spinal motoneuronal excitability could be ruled out since there was no significant increase of the SOL H-reflex until immediately prior to EMG onset for any of the tasks.

Concurrent TMS-fMRI may furthermore reveal how the brain adapts to so-called virtual lesions induced by TMS, and the distributed activity changes that may underlie the behavioural consequences often observed during cortical stimulation with TMS.

Subjects viewed video's showing left and right hand extension (palm-down) movements from a first person or third person perspective with their hand posture either congruent (palm-down) or incongruent (palm-up) to the posture of the observed model. Data indicated that facilitation of left M1 was substantially different for observing actions executed with the right (contralateral) or left (ipsilateral) hand. For right hand actions, facilitation of left M1 was shown to be highly specific to the muscle used in the observed action ('intrinsic mapping'). During the observation of left hand stimuli, only half of the subjects displayed this muscle specific facilitation, whereas in the other half, M1 was facilitated according to the observed movement direction ('extrinsic mapping'). Absolute effect magnitude was particularly high when right hand actions were observed from a first person perspective, whereas, for left hand actions, the third person perspective was more efficient.

This phenomenon, known as the Troxler effect, has been largely attributed to adaptation of neurons responding to peripheral targets. Here, we hypothesized that perceptual disappearance might result from degeneration of feedback from attention-related cortical areas to early visual areas and that visual transients disrupt the feedback loop sustaining low-level signals and thereby trigger perceptual fading. We examined this hypothesis by briefly disrupting the functions of attention-related regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The hypothesis predicted that temporary disruption of IPS would trigger perceptual disappearances. We measured perceptual disappearance using a task in which participants were asked to discriminate the presence or absence (fading) of a peripheral green target immediately after a TMS pulse. On one half of the trials, the target remained on the screen until the end of a trial, and on the other half of the trials, it gradually faded. The results of this experiment show that brief disruption of the IPS with a single pulse TMS is sufficient to trigger perceptual disappearance. TMS over the IPS resulted in a fewer reports of continuous percepts (i.e., more fading) without changes in the perception of physically fading stimuli. Our control experiment shows the loss of sensitivity is not caused by suppression of microsaccades in response to the sound produced by TMS.

Visual extinction may arise due to an imbalance in the normal interhemispheric competition. To directly assess the issue of reciprocal inhibition, we used fMRI to localize those brain regions active during attention-based visual tracking and then applied low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over identified areas in the left and right intraparietal sulcus to asses the behavioral effects on visual tracking.

Sensory inputs alone cannot provide a perfect state signal because of inevitable delays in their afferent pathways. We have recently reported the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the ipsilateral cerebellum as healthy subjects made rapid reaching movements towards visually defined targets (Miall et al. in PLoS Biology 5:2733-2744, 2007). Errors in the initial direction and in the final finger position of this reach-to-target movement were consistent with the reaching movements being planned and initiated from an estimated hand position that was about 138 ms out of date. This interval is consistent with estimates of the delays in sensory motor pathways that would inform the central nervous system of the peripheral status. We now report new data using the same paradigm, testing the effects of varying the TMS stimulus train from one, two, or three pulses. We show that the errors in movement are relatively insensitive to the TMS pulse-train duration. The estimated time interval by which the hand position is mislocalized varied by only 12 ms as the TMS train duration increased by 100 ms. Thus, this interval is likely to reflect physiological processes within the cerebellum rather than the TMS-stimulus duration. This new evidence supports our earlier claim that the cerebellum is responsible for predictively updating a central state estimate over an interval of about 120-140 ms.

Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and a stop-signal task, which occasionally requires the inhibition of a prepotent motor response, to investigate the role of pre-supplementary motor area (Pre-SMA) in inhibitory control. While no effects were seen on the ability to generate responses, TMS delivered over the Pre-SMA disrupted the ability to respond to a stop signal.

One framework for generating these predictive signals is based on the central nervous system implementing internal models. Internal models provide for representations of the input-output properties of the motor apparatus or their inverses. It has been widely hypothesized that the cerebellum acquires and stores internal models of the motor apparatus. The results of psychophysical, functional imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies in normal subjects support this hypothesis. Also, the deficits in patients with cerebellar dysfunction can be attributed to a failure of predictive feed forward control and/or to accurately estimate the consequences of motor commands. Furthermore, the computation performed by the cerebellar-like electrosensory lobes in several groups of fishes is to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands. However, only a few electrophysiological investigations have directly tested whether neurons in the cerebellar cortex have the requisite signals compatible with either an inverse or forward internal model. Our studies in the monkey performing manual pursuit tracking demonstrate that the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells does not have the dynamics-related signals required to be the output of an inverse dynamics model. However, Purkinje cell firing has several of the characteristics of a forward internal model of the arm. A synthesis of the evidence suggests that the cerebellum is involved in integrating the current state of the motor system with internally generated motor commands to predict the future state.", "pages": "388-400"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Myoinositol content in the human brain is modified by transcranial direct current stimulation in a matter of minutes: a 1H-MRS study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "18956227", "authors": ["Rango, M", "Cogiamanian, F", "Marceglia, S", "Barberis, B", "Arighi, A", "Biondetti, P", "Priori, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine : official journal of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine / Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine", "abstract": "Corticospinal excitability can be increased by a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intervention that delivers repeated paired TMS pulses at an I (indirect)-wave interval of 1.5 ms. This is thought to target excitatory synaptic events by reinforcing facilitatory I-wave interaction, however, it remains to be determined what effect this intervention has on the various I-wave components. In the present study we compared I-wave facilitation curves over a range of inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) encompassing the first three I-waves, before and after 15 min of a paired-pulse TMS intervention with an IPI of 1.5 ms. The three peaks in the I-wave facilitation curves occurred at the same IPIs pre- and post-intervention (1.3, 2.5 and 4.3 ms). The facilitation curves were increased in amplitude for all three I-wave peaks post-intervention (mean increase 33%), and the mean increase across all IPIs correlated with the post-intervention increase in single-pulse MEP amplitude (r = 0.77). Modelling showed that the changes in the post-intervention curves were consistent with an increase in amplitude and broadening of the individual I-wave peaks. We conclude that an iTMS intervention with an IPI of 1.5 ms is able to target multiple I-waves.

It is also thought to influence possible synaptic changes in motor cortex following a simple motor learning task. Here we extend these studies by using new non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) techniques that directly test the excitability and plasticity of neuronal circuits in human motor cortex in subjects at rest. We investigated whether the susceptibility to TMS probes of plasticity is significantly influenced by the BDNF polymorphism. Val66Met carriers were matched with Val66Val individuals and tested on the following protocols: continuous and intermittent theta burst TMS; median nerve paired associative stimulation; and homeostatic plasticity in the TDCS/1 Hz rTMS model. The response of Met allele carriers differed significantly in all protocols compared with the response of Val66Val individuals. We suggest that this is due to the effect of BNDF on the susceptibility of synapses to undergo LTP/LTD. The circuits tested here are implicated in the pathophysiology of movement disorders such as dystonia and are being assessed as potential new targets in the treatment of stroke.

The main focus is on classical lesion studies and studies using the interference method of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To understand the behavioural function of a region, it is essential to assess oculomotor deficits after a focal lesion using a variety of oculomotor paradigms, and to study the oculomotor consequences of the lesion in the chronic phase. Saccades are controlled by different cortical regions, which could be partially specialised in the triggering of a specific type of saccade. The division of saccades into reflexive visually guided saccades and intentional or volitional saccades corresponds to distinct regions of the neuronal network, which are involved in the control of such saccades. TMS allows to specifically interfere with the functioning of a region within an intact oculomotor network. TMS provides advantages in terms of temporal resolution, allowing to interfere with brain functioning in the order of milliseconds, thereby allowing to define the time course of saccade planning and execution. In the first part of the paper, we present an overview of the cortical structures important for saccade control, and discuss the pro's and con's of the different methodological approaches to study the cortical oculomotor network. In the second part, the functional network involved in reflexive and volitional saccades is presented.

To further establish the phenomenon of surround inhibition and to determine whether short intracortical inhibition (SICI) reflecting inhibition from the local interneurons in primary motor cortex (M1), might play a role in its genesis, single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and Hoffmann reflex testing were applied to evaluate the excitability of the relaxed abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) at various intervals during a movement of the index finger in 16 patients with FHD and 20 controls. Whereas controls showed inhibition of APB motor-evoked potential (MEP) size during movement initiation and facilitation of APB MEP size during the maintenance phase, FHD patients did not modulate APB MEP size. In contrast, SICI remained constant in controls, but FHD patients showed reduced SICI during movement initiation. The H(max)/M(max) ratio in control subjects increased during movement initiation. The results provide additional evidence for the presence of surround inhibition in M1, where it occurs only during movement initiation, indicating that different mechanisms underlie movement initiation and maintenance. Thus, surround inhibition is sculpted both in time and space and may be an important neural mechanism during movement initiation to counteract increased spinal excitability. SICI may contribute to its generation, because in patients with FHD, the lack of depression of APB MEP size is accompanied by a reduction in SICI.", "pages": "388-400"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review and metaanalysis.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "16698128", "authors": ["Lam, RW", "Chan, P", "Wilkins-Ho, M", "Yatham, LN"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Canadian journal of psychiatry.

However, recent studies demonstrate reduced activation of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with continuous vibrotactile tracking during bimodal stimulation. Reduced activation has been hypothesized to reflect an interaction between the sensorimotor and intermodal requirements of the tracking task. Recently, it has been shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involving a supra-threshold test stimulus (TS) preceded by a sub-threshold conditioning stimulus (CS) adversely affects tactile perception by altering excitability of local intracortical circuits. The purpose of the current paper was to use TMS to assess the effects of differential sensorimotor requirements in the right sensorimotor cortex upon local intracortical networks and sensory processing in the left primary somatosensory cortex during constant multimodal stimulation. Single and paired-pulse TMS was used to probe intracortical networks in S1 and sensory processing during a sensorimotor task where a vibrotactile stimulus to the right index finder guided either continuous or discrete sensorimotor responses of the left hand. It was hypothesized that paired-pulse TMS would alter local intracortical networks and reduce performance during the discrete sensorimotor task, but that these effects would be mitigated during the continuous sensorimotor task, possibly a reflection of reduced S1 activation observed previously during a similar continuous sensorimotor task. Regardless of sensorimotor requirements, single-pulse TMS delivered over S1 decreased sensorimotor performance. Paired-pulse TMS further decreased sensorimotor performance only when the vibrotactile stimulus guided a discrete motor response but not when it was required to continuously guide the motor response. This effect disappeared when the TS was replaced by a sub-threshold stimulus. These results suggest that the CS facilitates sensory output neurons during perceptual detection but that differential responsiveness of local cortical networks in S1 suppresses the CS effects during continuous sensory-guided movement.

As far as the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is expected to be a therapeutic tool in some movement disorders, the investigation of premotor cortex response to TMS seems to be an important first step. The goal of our work was to picture the difference in motor responses of premotor and primary motor areas to TMS, by means of motor threshold (MT), and to give a simple and easy testing method, which may be of use before trying therapeutic TMS in some motor disorders. It is based on the motor threshold values for arms and legs motor responses, as a primary motor and premotor cortex excitabity indicator. Only a transcranial magnetic stimulator is necessary for the investigation. A MagPro stimulator (Medtronic, Denmark) with an original C125 coil have been used. The hand and finger contraction motor threshold by TMS at C(z) was measured. After that the stimulation intensity (combined with facilitation), necessary for gaining muscle contraction in every arm and leg, contra- and ipsilaterally, by TMS at C(z), C3, C4, CF1 and CF2 (left and right premotor zones) was tried. The responses have been assessed visually. The results showed a bilateral arm and leg motor response to unilateral TMS of premotor area. The stimulation intensity necessary to evoke contraction in leg musculature was significant lower at premotor area than this at C(z). On the contrary the TMS at C3 and C4 resulted always only in a contra-lateral arm and sometimes leg contraction. The visual assessment of contra- and ipsilateraly leg and arm muscles participation allowed this to be scanned all over the body. Conclusion: The two motor generators (premotor and primary motor) show different behavior by TMS. The proposed method of motor threshold comparison in TMS of both motor and premotor cortex, necessary to gain motor responses in four limbs may be useful as an easy, fast and noninvasive functional test.", "pages": "388-400"}]
