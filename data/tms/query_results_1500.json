Intracerebral recordings and functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that this potential is generated by various brain regions including frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. Regarding the neurochemical background, clinical and genetic investigations suggest that dopaminergic neurons could be involved in the generation of the P300. However, there is no direct evidence in vivo that P300 amplitudes and latencies are related to dopaminergic parameters. The aim of this study was to further elucidate dopaminergic aspects of the P300 ERP by combining neurophysiological and nuclear medicine assessments in vivo. Patients with a major depressive episode underwent both P300 recordings and dynamic [\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I] IBZM SPECT for the evaluation of striatal dopamine D\u2082/D\u2083-receptor availability. There were statistically significant positive correlations of the striatal dopamine D\u2082/D\u2083-receptor status with P300 amplitudes and significant negative correlations with P300 latencies. Using this combined approach, the study presents direct evidence in vivo that the central dopaminergic system might play an important role in the generation of the P300 and that central dopaminergic activity could be involved in the modulation of P300 parameters. This association might be of relevance for the interpretation of P300 studies in psychiatric disorders.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "A pilot study of the tolerability and effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on pain perception.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "22104190", "authors": ["Borckardt, JJ", "Bikson, M", "Frohman, H", "Reeves, ST", "Datta, A", "Bansal, V", "Madan, A", "Barth, K", "George, MS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society", "abstract": "Several brain stimulation technologies are beginning to evidence promise as pain treatments.

A new tDCS design, called high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), allows for focal delivery of the charge to discrete regions of the cortex. We sought to preliminarily test the safety and tolerability of the HD-tDCS technique as well as to evaluate whether HD-tDCS over the motor cortex would decrease pain and sensory experience. Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers underwent quantitative sensory testing before and after 20 minutes of real (n = 13) or sham (n = 11) 2 mA HD-tDCS over the motor cortex. No adverse events occurred and no side effects were reported. Real HD-tDCS was associated with significantly decreased heat and cold sensory thresholds, decreased thermal wind-up pain, and a marginal analgesic effect for cold pain thresholds. No significant effects were observed for mechanical pain thresholds or heat pain thresholds. HD-tDCS appears well tolerated, and produced changes in underlying cortex that are associated with changes in pain perception. Future studies are warranted to investigate HD-tDCS in other applications, and to examine further its potential to affect pain perception.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Motor pathway excitability in ATP13A2 mutation carriers: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "22104014", "authors": ["Zittel, S", "Kroeger, J", "van der Vegt, JP", "Siebner, HR", "Br\u00fcggemann, N", "Ramirez, A", "Behrens, MI", "Gerloff, C", "B\u00e4umer, T", "Klein, C", "M\u00fcnchau, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "This article presents preliminary tolerability and efficacy data for a new focal brain stimulation technique called high definition transcranial direct current stimulation.

In three experiments, we investigated whether grapheme-color synesthesia is characterized by enhanced cortical excitability in primary visual cortex and the role played by this hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that synesthetes display 3-fold lower phosphene thresholds than controls during stimulation of the primary visual cortex. We next used transcranial direct current stimulation to discriminate between two competing hypotheses of the role of hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. We demonstrate that synesthesia can be selectively augmented with cathodal stimulation and attenuated with anodal stimulation of primary visual cortex.

The extent of cortical reorganization was predicted by spinal atrophy. We therefore expected to see a similar shift in the motor output of corticospinal projections of the forearm towards more denervated lower body parts in volunteers with cervical injury. Therefore, we used magnetic resonance imaging-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to non-invasively measure changes in cortical map reorganization of a forearm muscle in the primary motor cortex (M1) following human SCI. We recruited volunteers with chronic cervical injuries resulting in bilateral upper and lower motor impairment and severe cervical atrophy and healthy control participants. All participants underwent a T1-weighted anatomical scan prior to the TMS experiment. The motor thresholds of the extensor digitorum communis muscle (EDC) were defined, and its cortical muscle representation was mapped. The centre of gravity (CoG), the cortical silent period (CSP) and active motor thresholds (AMTs) were measured. Regression analysis was used to investigate relationships between trauma-related anatomical changes and TMS parameters. SCI participants had increased AMTs (P = 0.01) and increased CSP duration (P = 0.01). The CoG of the EDC motor-evoked potential map was located more posteriorly towards the anatomical hand representation of M1 in SCI participants than in controls (P = 0.03). Crucially, cord atrophy was negatively associated with AMT and CSP duration (r(2) \u2265 0.26, P < 0.05). In conclusion, greater spinal cord atrophy predicts changes at the cortical level that lead to reduced excitability and increased inhibition. Therefore, cortical forearm motor representations may reorganize towards the intrinsic hand motor representation to maximize output to muscles of the impaired forearm following SCI.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "What is the real effect of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hallucinations?

Therefore, here we aimed at investigating the integrity not only of intra-, but also of inter-hemispheric mechanisms of cortical motor excitability in AD. We determined the iSP, the resting motor threshold (RMT), and the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in 19 AD patients and 19 healthy controls using single-pulse TMS.

All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychologic, clinical, and laboratory testing, and neuroimaging to exclude significant co-morbidity. In AD patients, the RMT was significantly reduced (Oneway-ANOVA). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed a strong group specific interaction of the inhibitory interstimulus intervals (p = 0.005) with a reduced ICI in AD.

In this study, visual evoked potentials (VEP) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were recorded simultaneously in migraineurs and healthy subjects. In order to investigate the homeostatic-like plasticity in the visual cortex, cortical excitability was modified using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Before any stimulation, migraineurs showed significantly higher glutamate/creatine ratios (Glx/Cr) than healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, excitatory (anodal) tDCS caused an increase and inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS a decrease in the Glx/Cr ratio. Subsequent photic stimulation (PS) reversed the changes in Glx/Cr ratios, which returned back to baseline, demonstrating homeostatic-like metaplasticity in the control group. In migraine patients, both anodal and cathodal tDCS decreased the Glx/Cr ratio, which did not return to baseline after PS. While healthy subjects showed an increase in VEP amplitude under anodal and a reduction under cathodal tDCS, the modifiability of VEP under tDCS was reduced in migraineurs.

The low-frequency rTMS treatment impaired performance, but only when the subjects had not performed the task before: we found a TMS condition-by-order effect, such that real TMS treatment in the first session led to significantly more errors (P = 0.032), whereas this TMS effect was not present in subjects who received real TMS in the second session.

More recently, the same neurophysiological methods used to study episodic migraine were applied to CM and medication-overuse headache (MOH). Studies of cortical responsivity tend overall to indicate an increase in excitability, in particular of somatosensory and visual cortices, reflected by increased amplitude of evoked responses, decreased activity of inhibitory cortical interneurons reflected in the smaller magnetic suppression of perceptual accuracy, and, at least for visual responses, an increase in habituation.

The secondary task was either an auditory discrimination task (experiment 1) or a visual discrimination task (experiment 2). In experiment 1, we found that corticomotor excitability reflected the force requirements indicated in the observed movies (i.e. higher responses when the actor had to apply higher forces). Interestingly, this effect was found irrespective of whether MO was performed as a single or a dual task. By contrast, no such systematic modulations of corticomotor excitability were observed in experiment 2 when visual distracters were present. We conclude that interference effects might arise when MO is performed while competing visual stimuli are present. However, when a secondary task is situated in a different modality, neural responses are in line with the notion that the observers motor system responds in a near-automatic manner. This suggests that MO is a task with very low cognitive demands which might be a valuable supplement for rehabilitation training, particularly, in the acute phase after the incident or in patients suffering from attention deficits.

However, there is growing evidence that tinnitus is not a pathology of a specific brain region, but rather the result of network dysfunction involving both auditory and non-auditory brain regions. In functional imaging studies the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been identified as an important hub in tinnitus related networks and has been shown to particularly reflect the affective components of tinnitus. Based on these findings we aimed to investigate whether the effects of left low-frequency rTMS can be enhanced by antecedent right prefrontal low-frequency rTMS. Study Design: Fifty-six patients were randomized to receive either low-frequency left temporal rTMS or a combination of low-frequency right prefrontal followed by low-frequency left temporal rTMS. The change of the tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) score was the primary outcome, secondary outcome parameters included the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, numeric rating scales, and the Beck Depression Inventory. The study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01261949). Results: Directly after therapy there was a significant improvement of the TQ-score in both groups. Comparison of both groups revealed a trend toward more pronounced effects for the combined group (effect size: Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.176), but this effect did not reach significance. A persistent trend toward better efficacy was also observed in all other outcome criteria. Conclusion: Additional stimulation of the right prefrontal cortex seems to be a promising strategy for enhancing TMS effects over the temporal cortex. These results further support the involvement of the right DLPFC in the pathophysiology of tinnitus.

Over the following months a variable amount of recovery can be seen. The evidence from animal and human studies suggests that reorganization rather than repair is the key. Surviving neural networks are important for recovery of function and non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging allow us to study them in humans. For example, initial attempts to move a paretic limb following stroke are associated with widespread activity within the distributed motor system in both cerebral hemispheres, more so in patients with greater impairment. Disruption of activity in premotor areas using transcranial magnetic stimulation prior to movement can impair motor performance in stroke patients but not in controls suggesting that these new patterns of brain activity can support recovered function. In other words, this reorganisation is functionally relevant. More recently, research has been directed at understanding how surviving brain regions influence one another during movement. This opens the way for functional brain imaging to become a clinically useful tool in rehabilitation.

We addressed this issue with a simple nerve stimulation method to provide quantitative information regarding the size of EMG cross-talk between muscles of the forearm and hand. Peak to peak amplitude of EMG responses to electrical stimulation of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves (i.e., M-waves) were plotted against stimulation intensity for four wrist muscles and two hand muscles (n = 12). Since electrical stimulation can selectively activate specific groups of muscles, the method can differentiate between evoked EMG arising from target muscles and EMG cross-talk arising from nontarget muscles. Intramuscular EMG responses to nerve stimulation and root mean square EMG produced during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the wrist were recorded for comparison. Cross-talk was present in evoked surface EMG responses recorded from all nontarget wrist (5.05-39.38% Mmax) and hand muscles (1.50-24.25% Mmax) and to a lesser degree in intramuscular EMG signals (\u223c3.7% Mmax). The degree of cross-talk was comparable for stimulus-evoked responses and voluntary activity recorded during MVC. Since cross-talk can make a considerable contribution to EMG responses in forearm and hand muscles, care is required to avoid misinterpretation of EMG data.

Online effects were examined during A-tDCS by employing the semantic interference (SI-)Effect - a marker that denotes the functional integrity of the language system. The behavioural SI-Effect was found to be reduced, whereas the electrophysiological SI-Effect was enhanced over left compared to right temporal scalp-electrode sites.

These data provide clear evidence for a dorsal and ventral dissociation between the processing of near and far space, which is compatible with the functional roles previously attributed to the two streams. For example, the involvement of the dorsal stream in near space reflects its role in vision for action, because it is within this spatial location that actions can be performed.

Conceptually, therefore, rTMS could be used therapeutically to restore the balance of interhemispheric inhibition after stroke. rTMS has been used in two ways: low-frequency stimulation (\u22641 Hz) to the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere to reduce the excitability of the contralesional hemisphere or high-frequency stimulation (>1 Hz) to the motor cortex of the AH to increase excitability of the ipsilesional hemisphere.

Here, we review data from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to supraspinal mechanisms that are thought to regulate motor output from M1 during physical fatigue, and we propose a supraspinal model to regulate physical fatigue as well as a hypothetical model of fatigue in human diseases or syndromes.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "State-dependent and timing-dependent bidirectional associative plasticity in the human SMA-M1 network.", "issue": "43", "pmid": "9058398", "authors": ["Fertonani, A", "Pirulli, C", "Miniussi, C"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "The clinical benefits of intensive stroke rehabilitation vary individually.

In this revised version the MDS task force decided it was necessary to extend the review to non-motor symptoms. The objective of this work was to update previous EBM reviews on treatments for PD with a focus on non-motor symptoms. Level-I (randomized controlled trial, RCT) reports of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD, published as full articles in English between January 2002 and December 2010 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and ranking followed the original program outline and adhered to EBM methodology. For efficacy conclusions, treatments were designated: efficacious, likely efficacious, unlikely efficacious, non-efficacious, or insufficient evidence. Safety data were catalogued and reviewed. Based on the combined efficacy and safety assessment, Implications for clinical practice were determined using the following designations: clinically useful, possibly useful, investigational, unlikely useful, and not useful. Fifty-four new studies qualified for efficacy review while several other studies covered safety issues. Updated and new efficacy conclusions were made for all indications. The treatments that are efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: pramipexole for the treatment of depressive symptoms, clozapine for the treatment of psychosis, rivastigmine for the treatment of dementia, and botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) and BTX-B as well as glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea. The practical implications for these treatments, except for glycopyrrolate, are that they are clinically useful. Since there is insufficient evidence of glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea exceeding 1 week, the practice implication is that it is possibly useful. The treatments that are likely efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: the tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and desipramine for the treatment of depression or depressive symptoms and macrogol for the treatment of constipation. The practice implications for these treatments are possibly useful. For most of the other interventions there is insufficient evidence to make adequate conclusions on their efficacy. This includes the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reviewed (paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine), the newer antidepressants atomoxetine and nefazodone, pergolide, \u03a9-3 fatty acids as well as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression or depressive symptoms; methylphenidate and modafinil for the treatment of fatigue; amantadine for the treatment of pathological gambling; donepezil, galantamine, and memantine for the treatment of dementia; quetiapine for the treatment of psychosis; fludrocortisone and domperidone for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension; sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, ipratropium bromide spray for the treatment of sialorrhea; levodopa/carbidopa controlled release (CR), pergolide, eszopiclone, melatonin 3 to 5 mg and melatonin 50 mg for the treatment of insomnia and modafinil for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness. Due to safety issues the practice implication is that pergolide and nefazodone are not useful for the above-mentioned indications. Due to safety issues, olanzapine remains not useful for the treatment of psychosis. As none of the studies exceeded a duration of 6 months, the recommendations given are for the short-term management of the different non-motor symptoms. There were no RCTs that met inclusion criteria for the treatment of anxiety disorders, apathy, medication-related impulse control disorders and related behaviors other than pathological gambling, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sweating, or urinary dysfunction. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for the treatment of these indications. This EBM review of interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD updates the field, but, because several RCTs are ongoing, a continual updating process is needed. Several interventions and indications still lack good quality evidence, and these gaps offer an opportunity for ongoing research. \u00a9 2011 Movement Disorder Society.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Effective connectivity hierarchically links temporoparietal and frontal areas of the auditory dorsal stream with the motor cortex lip area during speech perception.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16324172", "authors": ["Addolorato, G", "Leggio, L", "Hopf, FW", "Diana, M", "Bonci, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain and language", "abstract": "Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we investigated short-interval intracortical inhibition and short-latency afferent inhibition in acute ischemic stroke.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Nonpharmacological treatment of epilepsy.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16450381", "authors": ["Murakami, T", "Restle, J", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology", "abstract": "We evaluated short-interval intracortical inhibition and short-latency afferent inhibition in the affected hemisphere and unaffected hemisphere in 16 patients and correlated electrophysiological parameters with outcome at 6 months.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Influence of area 5 on interhemispheric inhibition.", "issue": "18", "pmid": "19289224", "authors": ["Saxena, VS", "Nadkarni, VV"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Affected hemisphere short-latency afferent inhibition was significantly reduced in patients, and short-latency afferent inhibition level correlated with functional outcome.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "589", "title": "Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation in man: making things as simple as possible?", "issue": "Pt 24", "pmid": "22087266", "authors": ["Premji, A", "Zapallow, C", "Tsang, P", "Tang, R", "Jacobs, M", "Nelson, AJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Reduced afferent inhibition in acute stroke correlates with long-term recovery.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Cross-adaptation combined with TMS reveals a functional overlap between vision and imagery in the early visual cortex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17524764", "authors": ["Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been used to study changes in central excitability associated with motor tasks. Recently, we reported that a finger flexion-extension task performed at a maximal voluntary rate (MVR) could not be sustained and that this was not due to muscle fatigue, but was more likely a breakdown in central motor control. To determine the central changes that accompany this type of movement task, we tracked motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles of the dominant hand in normal subjects for 20\u00a0min after a 10 sec index finger flexion-extension task performed at MVR and at a moderate sustainable rate (MSR) and half the MSR (MSR(/2)). The FDI MEP amplitude was reduced for up to 6-8\u00a0min after each of the tasks but there was a greater and longer-lasting reduction after the MSR and MSR(/2) tasks compared to the MVR task. There was a similar reduction in the amplitude of the FDI MEP after a 10 sec cyclic index finger abduction-adduction task when the FDI was acting as the prime mover. The amplitude of the MEP recorded from the inactive APB was also reduced after the flexion-extension tasks, but to a lesser degree and for a shorter duration. Measurements of short-interval cortical inhibition revealed an increase in inhibition after all of the finger flexion-extension tasks, with the MSR task being associated with the greatest degree of inhibition. These findings indicate that a demanding MVR finger movement task is followed by a period of reduced corticomotor excitability and increased intracortical inhibition. However, these changes also occur with and are greater with slower rates of movement and are not specific for motor demand, but may be indicative of adaptive changes in the central motor pathway after a period of repetitive movement.", "pages": "212-8"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17669445", "authors": ["Cattaneo, Z", "Bona, S", "Silvanto, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Technology Evaluation Center Assessment Program.
