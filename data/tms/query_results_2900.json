This practice presumably relies on special processing circuits within the human brain associated with a distinct subjective experience, termed aesthetic experience, and preferentially evoked by artistic stimuli. We assume that positive or negative aesthetic judgments are an important function of neuroaesthetic circuits. The localisation of these circuits in the brain remains unclear, though neuroimaging studies have suggested several possible neural correlates of aesthetic preference. We applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over candidate brain areas to disrupt aesthetic processing while healthy volunteers made aesthetic preference judgments between pairs of dance postures, or control non-body stimuli. Based on evidence from visual body perception studies, we targeted the ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) and extrastriate body area (EBA), in the left and right hemispheres. rTMS over EBA reduced aesthetic sensitivity for body stimuli relative to rTMS over vPMC, while no such difference was found for non-body stimuli. We interpret our results within the framework of dual routes for visual body processing. rTMS over either EBA or vPMC reduced the contributions of the stimulated area to body processing, leaving processing more reliant on the unaffected route. Disruption of EBA reduces the local processing of the stimuli and reduced observers' aesthetic sensitivity. Conversely, disruption of the global route via vPMC increased the relative contribution of the local route via EBA and thus increased aesthetic sensitivity. In this way, we suggest a complementary contribution of both local and global routes to aesthetic processing.", "pages": "58-9, 101, 113"}, {"volume": "204", "title": "Extrastriate body area underlies aesthetic evaluation of body stimuli.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20473752", "authors": ["Calvo-Merino, B", "Urgesi, C", "Orgs, G", "Aglioti, SM", "Haggard, P"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In particular, we focused on the role of the cerebellum because this structure has been shown to play a role in both motor timing and error correction. Experiment 1 used fMRI to show that the right cerebellar dentate nucleus and primary motor and sensory cortices were activated during regular timing and during the correction of subliminal errors. The correction of supraliminal phase shifts led to additional activations in the left cerebellum and right inferior parietal and frontal areas. Furthermore, a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that supraliminal error correction was associated with enhanced connectivity of the left cerebellum with frontal, auditory, and sensory cortices and with the right cerebellum. Experiment 2 showed that suppression of the left but not the right cerebellum with theta burst TMS significantly affected supraliminal error correction.

During and just prior to dorsiflexion of the ankle, soleus motoneurones are thus inhibited as evidenced by a depression of the soleus H-reflex. It is therefore surprising that soleus motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been found not to be reduced and even facilitated during a voluntary dorsiflexion. The objective of this study was to investigate if MEPs, evoked by TMS, show a similar facilitation prior to and at the onset of contraction of muscles that are antagonists to the muscle in which the MEP is evoked and if so, examine the origin of such a facilitatory motor programme. Eleven seated subjects reacted to an auditory cue by contracting either the tibialis anterior (TA) or soleus muscle of the left ankle. TMS was applied to the hotspot of TA and soleus muscles on separate days. Stimuli were delivered prior to and at the beginning of contraction. Soleus MEPs were significantly facilitated when TMS was applied 50 ms prior to onset of plantar flexion. Surprisingly, soleus MEPs were also facilitated (although to a lesser extent) at a similar time in relation to the onset of dorsiflexion. TA MEPs were facilitated 50 ms prior to onset of dorsiflexion and neither depressed nor facilitated prior to plantar flexion. No difference was found between the facilitation of the soleus MEP and motor evoked responses to cervicomedullary stimulation prior to dorsiflexion, suggesting that the increased soleus MEPs were not caused by changes at a cortical level. This was confirmed by the observation that short-latency facilitation of the soleus H-reflex by subthreshold TMS was increased prior to plantar flexion, but not prior to dorsiflexion. These findings suggest that voluntary contraction at the ankle is accompanied by preceding facilitation of antagonists by a subcortical motor programme.

We also measured the influence of visuomotor adaptation on corticospinal excitability, to test whether any changes in muscle directional tuning are associated with adaptations in the final output components of the sensorimotor control system. Nine right-handed subjects performed a ballistic, center-out isometric target acquisition task with the right wrist (16 targets spaced every 22.5 degrees in the joint space). Surface electromyography was recorded from four major wrist muscles, and motor evoked potentials induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured at baseline, after task execution in the absence of the rotation (A1), after adaptation to the rotation (B), and after a final block of trials without rotation (A2). Changes in the directional tuning of muscles closely matched the rotation of the directional error in force, indicating that the functional contribution of muscles remained consistent over the adaptation period. In contrast to previous motor learning studies, we found only minor changes in the amount of muscular activity and no increase in corticospinal excitability. These results suggest that increased muscle co-activation occurs only when the dynamics of the limb are perturbed and/or that online error corrections or altered force requirements are necessary to elicit a component of the adaptation in the final steps of the transformation between motor goal and muscle activation.", "pages": "58-9, 101, 113"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of refractory chronic tinnitus: a randomized, placebo controlled study.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16273394", "authors": ["Anders, M", "Dvorakova, J", "Rathova, L", "Havrankova, P", "Pelcova, P", "Vaneckova, M", "Jech, R", "Holcat, M", "Seidl, Z", "Raboch, J"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuro endocrinology letters", "abstract": "Stereotyped behaviors should be inhibited under some circumstances in order to encourage appropriate behavior.

It is thought that the win response is the stereotyped response in the RPS task, and the difficulty in making positive attempts to lose is due to the requirement for inhibition of the stereotyped response. In this study, we investigated the brain regions related to inhibition of the stereotyped response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

In particular, the subjects had a tendency to win erroneously in a lose condition even though they were required to lose.

Historical and some contemporary theories emphasize that conceptualization stems from the joint action of modality-specific association cortices (the \"distributed\" theory) reflecting our accumulated verbal, motor, and sensory experiences. Parallel studies of semantic dementia, rTMS in normal participants, and neuroimaging indicate that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) plays a crucial and necessary role in conceptualization by merging experience into an amodal semantic representation. Some contemporary computational models suggest that concepts reflect a hub-and-spoke combination of information--modality-specific association areas support sensory, verbal, and motor sources (the spokes) while anterior temporal lobes act as an amodal hub.

Although natural neuronal activity can be experimentally manipulated in vivo, very little is known about the in vivo physiological mechanisms involved in regulating this metaplasticity in models of LTP/LTD. To examine whether Ca(2+) signaling may influence metaplasticity in vivo in humans, we used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) (Huang et al., 2005), a noninvasive novel repetitive magnetic stimulation protocol known to induce persistent alterations of corticospinal excitability whose polarity is changed by previous voluntary motor activity. When directed to the naive motor cortex, cTBS induced long-lasting potentiation of corticospinal excitability, but depression under the influence of nimodipine (NDP), an L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) antagonist. Both aftereffects were blocked by dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor antagonist, supporting the notion that these bidirectional cTBS-induced alterations of corticospinal excitability map onto LTP and LTD as observed in animal studies. A short period of voluntary contraction and a small dose of NDP were each ineffective in blocking the cTBS-induced potentiation. However, when both interventions were combined, a depression was induced, and the magnitude of this depression increased with the dose of NDP. These findings suggest that Ca(2+) dynamics determine the polarity of LTP/LTD-like changes in vivo.

In the task, subjects responded with finger flexion or extension to a central arrow while ignoring congruent or incongruent flanker arrows. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over primary motor cortex (M1) at one of five different latencies after stimulus onset, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in the contralateral index finger. During the control (no flankers) and congruent conditions, MEP size in the agonist increased gradually over the course of reaction time, indicating an increase in corticospinal excitability. Conversely, when the same muscle acted as an antagonist, MEP size decreased, suggesting inhibition. Critically, in the incongruent condition, MEPs briefly increased in the muscle corresponding to an initial default response to the flanker arrows and were later replaced by MEPs corresponding to the correct response to the central arrow. Finally, we found that the gradually growing MEPs for the three conditions reached a constant maximum level just before movement initiation. We propose that this dynamic modulation in corticospinal excitability reflects the competition process, leading to the selection of one response and the rejection of the other.

Since bottom-up processes favor high saliency, detection of a low-salient target in the presence of highly salient distractors requires top-down attentional guidance. Previous studies have demonstrated that top-down attention can modulate perceptual processing and also that the control of attention is driven by frontoparietal regions. However, to date, there is no direct evidence on the cause and effect relationship between control regions and perceptual processing. Here, we report the first evidence demonstrating a neural circuit for the downregulation of salient distractors when a low-salient target is selected, combining brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging with brain stimulation by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Using these combined techniques, we were able to identify a cause and effect relationship in the suppression of saliency, based on an interaction between the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and a region implicated in visual processing in our task (the left occipital pole). In particular, low-salient stimuli were selected by the left IPS suppressing early visual areas that would otherwise respond to a high-saliency distractor in the task. Apart from providing a first documentation of the neural circuit supporting selection by saliency, these data can be critical for understanding the underlying causes of problems in ignoring irrelevant salience that are found in both acquired and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or autism).", "pages": "58-9, 101, 113"}, {"volume": "177", "title": "Effects of 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on clinical global impression in chronic schizophrenia.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "10524626", "authors": ["Cordes, J", "Th\u00fcnker, J", "Agelink, MW", "Arends, M", "Mobascher, A", "Wobrock, T", "Schneider-Axmann, T", "Brinkmeyer, J", "Mittrach, M", "Regenbrecht, G", "W\u00f6lwer, W", "Winterer, G", "Gaebel, W"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "Tinnitus is a public health issue in France.

It has been proposed that glutamate-related excitotoxicity may promote motor neuron death in ALS. Glutamatergic circuits of the human motor cortex can be activated noninvasively using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain, and repetitive TMS (rTMS) can produce changes in neurotransmission that outlast the period of stimulation. In recent years a remarkable number of papers about the potential effects of rTMS in several neurological disorders including ALS has been published. Preliminary studies have shown that rTMS of the motor cortex, at frequencies that decrease cortical excitability, causes a slight slowing in the progression rate of ALS, suggesting that these effects might be related to a diminution of glutamate-driven excitotoxicity. RTMS could also interfere with motor neuron death through different mechanisms: rTMS could modulate the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent survival factor for neurons, that in turn might represent a promoter of motor neuron sparing in ALS. Despite some promising preliminary data, recent studies have demonstrated a lack of significant long-term beneficial effects of rTMS on neurological deterioration in ALS. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate the potential efficacy of different protocols of motor cortex stimulation (in terms of technique, duration and frequency of stimulation), particularly during the early stages of the disease when the progression rate is more pronounced.", "pages": "58-9, 101, 113"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency: report of transcranial magnetic stimulation follow-up study in a patient with multiple sclerosis.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12096875", "authors": ["Plasmati, R", "Pastorelli, F", "Fini, N", "Salvi, F", "Galeotti, R", "Zamboni, P"], "year": "2010", "journal": "International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology", "abstract": "After an incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) or stroke, the impairment of both muscle strength and accurate muscle coordination (timing and amplitude) is an expected clinical finding, although these aspects are not well-distinguished by clinical tests.
