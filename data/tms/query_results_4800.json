In the present study, we examined how PAS over the motor cortex affected a distant site, the somatosensory cortex. Furthermore, the influences of PAS on high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) were investigated to clarify the origin of HFOs. Interstimulus intervals between median nerve stimulation and TMS were 25 ms (PAS(25)) and 10 ms (PAS(10)). PAS was performed over the motor and somatosensory cortices. SEPs following median nerve stimulation were recorded before and after PAS. HFOs were isolated by 400-800 Hz band-pass filtering. PAS(25) over the motor cortex increased the N20-P25 and P25-N33 amplitudes and the HFOs significantly. The enhancement of the P25-N33 amplitude and the late HFOs lasted more than 60 min. After PAS(10) over the motor cortex, the N20-P25 and P25-N33 amplitudes decreased for 40 min, and the HFOs decreased for 60 min. Frontal SEPs were not affected after PAS over the motor cortex. PAS(25/10) over the somatosensory cortex did not affect SEPs and HFOs. PAS(25/10) over the motor cortex caused the LTP/LTD-like phenomena in a distant site, the somatosensory cortex. The PAS paradigms over the motor cortex can modify both the neural generators of SEPs and HFOs. HFOs may reflect the activation of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons regulating pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex.", "pages": "339-47"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "[Immediate effects of therapeutic interventions on the central motor system and their practical consequences].", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17721836", "authors": ["Woldag, H", "Renner, C", "Hummelsheim, H"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Die Rehabilitation", "abstract": "Physiotherapy and occupational therapy have changed over recent years influenced by our growing neurophysiological knowledge especially about motor learning. Understanding the direct effects of therapeutic interventions on the central motor system is crucial for further development of therapeutic approaches. Recent studies are discussed dealing with the facilitatory effects of different therapeutic interventions and the question whether or not the activation of the healthy upper limb has a facilitatory or inhibitory net-effect on the damaged central motor system. In a controlled study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) we could show that motor system excitability is not influenced by the contraction type (isometric or isotonic), neither in healthy nor in stroke patients. Two TMS-studies could show that voluntary exercises of the non-affected hand alone or in bimanual tasks do not have an inhibitory effect on the damaged central motor system. However, the strongest facilitation of the damaged motor area could be achieved by voluntary activation of the affected extremity. The therapeutic approach in severely or completely paretic upper limbs should, hence, be focussed on functional compensation. As soon as voluntary activity is obtainable intensive voluntary exercises should however be preferred, with contraction type (isometric or isotonic) seeming not to be important.", "pages": "339-47"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Motor and somatosensory evoked potentials in Autosomal Dominant Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (ADHSP) linked to chromosome 2p, SPG4.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17720546", "authors": ["Sartucci, F", "Tovani, S", "Murri, L", "Sagliocco, L"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "The aim of our study was to evaluate Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) and cortical excitability, using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as well as short latency Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) in Autosomal Dominant Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (ADHSP) patients. MEPs were recorded from upper and lower limb muscles in 12 patients (7 m and 5f) affected by ADHSP with spastin mutation (SPG4). We measured: (i) motor threshold (MTh); (ii) total motor conduction time (TMCT); (iii) direct and indirect central motor conduction time (d-CMCT and i-CMCT) calculated by subtracting from the cortical latency those obtained on magnetic spinal stimulation (d-PMCT) and via the F-wave method (i-PMCT); (iv) MEP amplitude (MEP/Mmax ratio%) and (v) duration of the cortical silent period (CSP). Latency, amplitude and persistence of the F-wave obtained with electrical nerve stimulation were also considered; H reflex was also tested from lower extremities. SEPs were recorded from spine and scalp sites following median and posterior tibial nerve stimulation; conventional latency and amplitude measurements were performed. In a comparison with the control group, the MTh recording from lower limbs was significantly higher (67.5 +/- 7.7% versus 52.5 +/- 6.9%), MEPs were absent in one case and showed reduced amplitude in the remainders (22.9 +/- 12.6% versus 66.3 +/- 25.9% of M wave); TMCT resulted to be abnormal (36.5 +/- 3.9 ms versus 27.1 +/- 1.4 ms) and d-CMCT as well as i-CMCT were significantly prolonged (23.1 +/- 3.5 ms versus 13.8 +/- 1.3 ms; and 20.1 +/- 3.4 ms versus 10.6 +/- 1.3 ms, respectively). The CSP, which was normal from the hands, was significantly shortened from the legs and correlated with spasticity scoring (Ashworth scale). Cortical SEPs from lower limbs were abnormal in all cases, whereas SEPs by stimulation of median nerves were normal; F-wave parameters from upper limbs showed no abnormalities, whereas an increased persistence was detected from lower limbs; H reflex amplitudes resulted larger compared with controls. Moreover, shortening of the CSP, being correlated with the Ashworth scale, can be considered an electrophysiological marker of spasticity that seems to arise from impairment of the supraspinal or intracortical inhibitory pathways with an additional contribution of increased segmental motor neuron excitability.

Similar to the hand area, 10 min of stimulation with the anode over the leg area of the motor cortex increased the excitability of corticospinal tract projections to the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, as reflected by an increase in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation.

However, it is unclear how mirror neurons acquire their mirror properties -- how they derive the information necessary to match observed with executed actions [10]. We address this by showing that it is possible to manipulate the selectivity of the human mirror system, and thereby make it operate as a countermirror system, by giving participants training to perform one action while observing another. Before this training, participants showed event-related muscle-specific responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation over motor cortex during observation of little- and index-finger movements [11-13]. After training, this normal mirror effect was reversed. These results indicate that the mirror properties of the mirror system are neither wholly innate [14] nor fixed once acquired; instead they develop through sensorimotor learning [15, 16].

Studies in experimental animals and humans have revealed that tinnitus is associated with a synchronized hyperactivity in the auditory cortex and proposed that the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is thalamocortical dysrhythmia; hence, decreased auditory stimulation results in decreased firing rate, and decreased lateral inhibition. Consequently, the surrounding brain area becomes hyperactive, firing at gamma band rates; this is considered a necessary precondition of auditory consciousness, and also tinnitus. Synchronization of the gamma band activity could possibly induce a topographical reorganization based on Hebbian mechanisms. Therefore, it seems logical to try to suppress tinnitus by modifying the tinnitus-related auditory cortex reorganization and hyperactivity. This can be achieved using neuronavigation-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is capable of modulating cortical activity. If TMS is capable of suppressing tinnitus, the effect should be maintained by implanting electrodes over the area of electrophysiological signal abnormality on the auditory cortex.

A variety of different stimulation approaches to seizure control targeting structures in the central or peripheral nervous system have been investigated. Most studies have been based on uncontrolled observations and empirical stimulation protocols. Today the vagus nerve stimulator is the only FDA approved adjunctive treatment for epilepsy that utilizes electrical stimulation. Other potential strategies including direct stimulation of the epileptogenic cortex and deep brain stimulation of various targets are currently under investigation. Chronically implanted devices for electrical stimulation have a variety of limitations. First, they are susceptible to malfunction and infection. Second, most systems require battery replacement. Finally, electrical stimulation is incapable of manipulating neuronal function in a transmitter specific fashion. Gene delivery to epileptogenic targets or targets implicated in regulating seizure threshold has been investigated as an alternative means of neuromodulation in animal models.

A possible predictive factor might be a test of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex. MCS may act by rebalancing the control of non-nociceptive sensory inputs over nociceptive afferents at cortical, thalamic, brainstem and spinal level. In addition, it may interfere with the emotional component of nociceptive perception. Biochemical processes involving endorphins and GABA may also be implicated in the mechanism of MCS.

Optimal patient selection remains difficult and the value of pharmacological tests or transcranial magnetic stimulation in predicting the efficacy of MCS has not been established. Pre-operative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 3-dimensional volume MRI, neuronavigation and intra-operative neurophysiological monitoring have contributed to improvements in the technique for identifying the precise location of the targeted motor cortical area and the correct placement of the electrode array. MCS should be considered as the treatment of choice in post-stroke pain, thalamic pain or facial anesthesia dolorosa. In brachial plexus avulsion pain, it is preferable to propose initially dorsal root entry zone (DREZ)-tomy; MCS may be offered after DREZotomy has failed to control the pain.

After a description of the main results of these 30 studies, several elements of the 66 will be discussed. Open studies demonstrated that short courses rTMS (5 to 10 sessions) produced a decrease in the mean Hamilton Depression Ratting Scale (HDRS) scores, although significant remission of depression in individuals was rare. Most authors had used high frequency rTMS applied to the left Dorso Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (left DLPFC). However, low frequency rTMS applied to the right DLPFC was also followed by significant reduction of HDRS scores. Parallel arm, double blind versus placebo studies are designed to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS therapy but conclude in contradicting results. Literature data globally confirms a greater efficacy of rTMS compared to placebo (37% responders in the active group vs 20% in the sham). This efficacy could in fact be even greater because the sham procedure is disputable in most studies. Indeed, positioning rTMS coil at 45 or 90 from the scalp may not represent an accurate sham procedure and the use of real sham coil is to be recommended. Only one study has suggested that associating rTMS and ECT could decrease the number of general anesthesia required. Therapeutic efficacy has been shown by either inhibiting the right DLPFC or by stimulating the left DLPFC, although some patients exhibit paradoxical responses. High frequency rTMS (>5 Hz) increases cortical excitability and metabolism, while low-frequency rTMS stimulation ( 1 Hz) has the opposite effect. Other parameters are: relevant: intensity (from 80 to 110% of motor threshold), total number of stimulations (from 120 to 2 000) and total number of rTMS sessions (from 5 to 20). As suggested in most recent studies, higher-intensity pulses, higher number of stimulation or longer treatment courses may be more effective.
