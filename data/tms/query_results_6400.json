A conditioning stimulus over right dPM at an intensity of either 90 or 110% resting motor threshold (RMT) suppressed motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle by stimulation of left M1. Maximum effects occurred for interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 8-10 ms. There was no effect if the conditioning stimulus was applied 2.5 cm lateral, anterior or medial to dPM. The effect differed from previously described M1 interhemispheric inhibition in that the threshold for the latter was greater than 90% RMT, whereas stimulation of the dPM at the same intensity led to significant inhibition. In addition, voluntary contraction of the left FDI (i.e. contralateral to the conditioning TMS) enhanced interhemispheric inhibition from right M1 but had no effect on the inhibition from right dPM. Finally, conditioning to right dPM at 90% RMT reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI; at ISI = 2 ms) in left M1 whilst there was no effect if the conditioning stimulus was applied to right M1.

Motor evoked potentials were recorded at different time-points during the observation of the video-clips.

Results show that the resonant motor plan is loaded as whole at the beginning of observation and once started tends to proceed to its completion regardless of changes to the visual cues. The results exclude the possibility of a temporal fragmentation of the resonant plan, because activation of different populations of mirror neurons for each phase of the ongoing action.

For fMRI, two approaches were used to determine hemispheric dominance. First, we measured brain activity as the extent of the activated region, i.e., the number of activated voxels above a statistical threshold. Second, we calculated the magnitude of the fMRI signal change between the activation and the control task within a region of interest. Results of fTCD and fMRI were concordant in every single case.

The first method used a conventional approach of setting conditioning stimulus intensity to 80% of rest threshold (RTh) and test stimulus intensity to 120% RTh. Three interstimulus intervals (ISIs) were used: 2 msec, 3 msec, and the ISI between 2 and 3 msec that produced optimal SICI. The second method was novel in that test stimulus intensity was set to 150% active threshold (ATh), and conditioning stimulus intensity was varied between 50% and 100% ATh. The latter was determined at the threshold for SICI and expressed as a ratio of ATh. There was no difference between the subject groups in the degree of SICI produced using the first method, at the three ISIs studied.

Here we ask whether pure sensory input can also influence the spatial distribution of sensory effects on motor cortical hand area (sensorimotor organization) and whether this is modulated by attention. Sensorimotor organization was tested by applying short (1.5 s) periods of low amplitude vibration to single intrinsic hand muscles and measuring motor cortex excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In healthy subjects, sensorimotor organization in the hand is focal, with input from one hand muscle increasing motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), decreasing short and increasing long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) in the vibrated muscle ('homotopic' effects) and having opposite effects on neighbouring muscles ('heterotopic' effects). Here we show that a 15 min intervention of vibration applied simultaneously to two hand muscles can lead to long-term (> 30 min) changes in the spatial pattern of sensorimotor interaction. The amount and direction of the effects depended on the subject's attention during the intervention: if subjects attended to both muscles when they were receiving simultaneous vibration, subsequent short-term vibration applied to one of them produced 'homotopic' effects on both muscles. 'Heterotopic' effects on a muscle not vibrated during the intervention were unaffected. If subjects did not attend to simultaneous vibration, subsequent short-term vibration of the muscles involved in the intervention no longer had any effect on them although the 'heterotopic' effects on a muscle not involved in the intervention were unchanged. We conclude that a 15 min period of pure sensory input can remodel the way that subsequent sensory inputs interact with motor output, that the effects are specific for the motor output to muscles involved in the intervention and that they are modulated by the subject's attention.", "pages": "2556-9"}, {"volume": "115", "title": "MRI study of human brain exposed to weak direct current stimulation of the frontal cortex.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "10817608", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Niehaus, L", "Hoffmann, KT", "Hengst, S", "Liebetanz, D", "Paulus, W", "Meyer, BU"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Number processing is known to involve several sites within the posterior regions of parietal cortex.

We compared the effects of rTMS (a rapid-rate train occurring simultaneously to the presentation of memoranda) applied to the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on visuospatial recognition memory in 66 healthy subjects divided in two classes of age (<45 and >50 years). In young subjects, rTMS of the right DLPFC interfered with retrieval more than left DLPFC stimulation. The asymmetry of the effect progressively vanished with aging, as indicated by bilateral interference effects on recognition performance. Conversely, the predominance of left DLPFC effect during encoding was not abolished in elders, thus probing its causal role for encoding along the life span.

There were significant differences between the mean response of the UPDRS III arm scores to the four test conditions. In conclusion our study demonstrates short-term beneficial effects of 10-Hz rTMS on motor symptoms in PD patients. A release of endogenous dopamine in subcortical structures, i.e. putamen, in response to rTMS is the most likely mechanism of action.", "pages": "2556-9"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Safety and benefits of distance-adjusted prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation in depressed patients 55-75 years of age: a pilot study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "8386377", "authors": ["Nahas, Z", "Li, X", "Kozel, FA", "Mirzki, D", "Memon, M", "Miller, K", "Yamanaka, K", "Anderson, B", "Chae, JH", "Bohning, DE", "Mintzer, J", "George, MS"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Depression and anxiety", "abstract": "To determine the reliability of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and biceps brachii muscles.", "pages": "2556-9"}, {"volume": "560", "title": "Demonstration of a second rapidly conducting cortico-diaphragmatic pathway in humans.", "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "8359263", "authors": ["Sharshar, T", "Hopkinson, NS", "Jonville, S", "Prigent, H", "Carlier, R", "Dayer, MJ", "Swallow, EB", "Lofaso, F", "Moxham, J", "Polkey, MI"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Fourteen college subjects attended the laboratory on three separate days.

To investigate the neural correlates of this coupling modality, excitability of the motor projections innervating the resting forearm was tested during cyclic voluntary flexion-extensions of the ipsilateral foot. H-reflexes, in some experiments facilitated by subliminal Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), and Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CMAPs), evoked by supraliminal TMS, were elicited in Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) and Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR) muscles at five intervals during the foot movement cycle. With the hand prone, a sinusoidal excitability modulation was observed in wrist flexors and extensors, but reversed in phase: in FCR, excitability increased during plantar-flexion and decreased during dorsiflexion, while in ECR the opposite occurred. This reciprocal organisation was confirmed by the excitability modulation of CMAPs evoked simultaneously in the two antagonists. When the hand was supinated, the H-reflex modulation reversed in phase, i.e., FCR excitability increased during foot dorsiflexion and decreased during plantar-flexion. In both muscles and hand positions tested, when the muscle-to-movement phase-lag was increased by inertial loading of the foot, H-reflex excitability modulations remained phase linked to muscular contractions, not to movement. Together, these results suggest that the subliminal excitability modulation of hand movers has a common central origin with the parallel overt activation of foot movers, is reciprocally organised, and is direction- not muscle-dependent. It may therefore represent the neural substrate for isodirectional coupling of hand (prone or supine) with the foot.", "pages": "2556-9"}]
