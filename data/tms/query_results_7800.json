Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "Since the time of introducing ECT to the clinical practice, the method always raised questions regarding possibility that the current running through structures of a brain may evoke structural changes and, as a result, evoke convulsive attacks. Pathological changes (swelling, gliosis, atrophy, necrosis) were observed most often after \"mega\"--schemes including series of several to several hundred ECT treatments. Regime used nowadays including only 8-12 ECT sessions seems to be entirely safe. There are, however, only a few experimental works dealing with this problem. In 1992 research started on a new neurophysiological technique--transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in depression. The advantage of this method is that is does not seem to evoke convulsive attacks. Prolonged rapid rate TMS (rTMS) seems to be particularly efficient in treatment of depression. Despite thousands of works describing various functional effects of TMS, there are obviously no researches on structural effects of the technique. In the case of experimental research on animals a few works were published and their results seem to be ambiguous. We have examined the influence of prolonged repetitive rTMS (B = 1.4 T, t = 5.5 min, f = 30 Hz), and standard ECT (I = 150 mA, t = 0.5 s, f = 50 Hz) on the structure of brain tissue in rats. Both groups of animals (n = 10) received 12 stimulation sessions. After the treatment the animals were routinely processed for electron microscopy (EM) and for light microscopy (LM). Our investigations suggest that the technique of ECT shows a considerable neurotoxic potential.

Surface EMG was recorded from the wrist flexors and extensors together with wrist position. Movements in both directions were characterised by the usual triphasic pattern of EMG activity in agonist (AG1), antagonist (ANTAG) and again in agonist (AG2) muscles. Single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were applied over the motor cortex at an intensity of 80 % of resting threshold at random times between 80 and 380 ms after the cue. We measured the peak-to-peak amplitude of the evoked motor potential (MEP) and the integrated EMG (IEMG) activity that preceded the MEP. In a separate set of experiments H reflexes were elicited in the wrist flexors instead of MEPs. MEP amplitudes in the agonist muscle increased by an average of 10 +/- 8 ms (range -1 to 23 ms) prior to the onset of the AG1 burst and were associated with an increase of over sevenfold in the MEP:IEMG ratio, irrespective of movement direction. Agonist H reflex amplitudes were linearly related to, and increased at the same time as, changes in agonist IEMG. The principal ANTAG burst was not preceded by an increase in the antagonist muscle MEP:IEMG ratio. No relationship was found between the amplitude of the antagonist H reflexes and the preceding antagonist IEMG. Five subjects showed an increase in the MEP:IEMG ratio preceding and during the initial part of the AG2 burst. Our method of analysis shows that changes in motor cortical excitability mediating the initiation of movement occur much closer to the onset of EMG activity (less than 23 ms) than the 80-100 ms lead time previously reported. The lack of such changes before the onset of the ANTAG burst suggests that this may be initiated by a different, perhaps subcortical, mechanism.", "pages": "61-3"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Motor evoked potential studies in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "3734856", "authors": ["Wochnik-Dyjas, D", "Niewiadomska, M", "Kulczycki, J", "Lojkowska, W", "Niedzielska, K", "Glazowski, C", "Inglot, E", "Wieclawska, M"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The pathophysiology of many orofacial pain syndromes is still unclear.

Magnetic pulses were delivered with a large coil at intensities 1.1 and 1.5 times the motor threshold, and for each intensity, MEPs were recorded at three different clenching levels: 15, 30 and 45% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Baseline, pain and post-baseline recordings were compared in two sessions. Firstly, muscle pain was induced by infusion of hypertonic saline (5.8%) into the left masseter. Secondly, skin pain was induced by topical application of capsaicin (5%) on the left cheek. Muscle and skin pain did not induce significant effects on the amplitude or latency of the MEPs (ANOVAs: P>0.50). In both sessions, the amplitude of the MEPs increased with the increase of the clenching level and stimulus intensity (P<0.0001; P<0.005) whereas the latency was not significantly changed (P>0.05; P=0.11). Muscle pain was associated with an increase in the pre-stimulus EMG activity on the non-painful side compared with baseline (P<0.01), which could be due to compensatory changes in the activation of the painful muscle. The need for voluntary contraction to evoke MEPs in the masseter muscles and compensatory mechanisms both at the brainstem and cortical level might explain the lack of detectable modulation of MEPs.

Our understanding of visual search has been enriched by an interdisciplinary effort using a wide range of research techniques including behavioural studies in humans [1], single-cell electrophysiology [2], transcranial magnetic stimulation [3], event-related potentials [4] and studies of patients with focal brain injury [5]. A central question is what kind of information controls the search process. Visual search is typically accompanied by a series of eye movements, and investigating the nature and location of fixations helps to identify the kind of information that might control the search process. It has already been demonstrated that objects are fixated if they are visually similar to the target [6]. Also, if an item has been fixated, it is less likely to be returned to on the subsequent saccade. This automatic process is referred to as inhibition of return (IOR [7,8]). Here, we investigated the role of memory for which items had been fixated previously. We found that, during search, subjects often refixated items that had been previously fixated. Although there were fewer return saccades than would be expected by chance, the number of refixations indicated limited functional memory, indeed the memory effects that were present may primarily be a result of IOR.", "pages": "61-3"}, {"volume": "82", "title": "Neurophysiological tests of respiratory function by compound muscle action potentials from the diaphragm.

We have postulated that the loss of GABA-ergic inputs from spinal interneurones alone is insufficient to produce tonic firing of motor neurones and that excessive supraspinal excitation could also play a role. To determine whether SPS is associated with dysfunction in supraspinal GABA-ergic neurones, we assessed the excitability of the motor cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in seven SPS patients and seven age-matched healthy volunteers. SPS patients had normal central motor conduction times, normal thresholds for motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in leg muscles, and a normal MEP stimulus versus response recruitment curve with increasing TMS intensities in resting hand and leg muscles. Cortical silent periods were shortened in leg muscles. Intracortical inhibition and excitation were assessed while recording from the abductor pollicis brevis, using a paired pulse TMS paradigm with subthreshold conditioning stimuli. Patients had decreased inhibition and markedly increased facilitation at short intervals. Using paired suprathreshold TMS, patients exhibited increased facilitation at 20- and 40-ms intervals.
