Methods: The amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and superimposed twitch and the duration of the silent period were recorded in 8 healthy participants in response to TMS delivered during brief isometric voluntary contractions of the quadriceps maintaining a target force (10% and 50% of maximal voluntary force) or gradually increasing or decreasing to reach this point. Results: MEP and superimposed twitch, unlike the silent period, are influenced by the manner of reaching a low force. Conclusions: Clear instructions must be provided to research participants and patients. Rapidly increasing to a target force without exceeding it and maintaining the force before the delivery of TMS results in stable, representative MEP amplitudes.

In this experiment, we demonstrate the administration of low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) to an optimal stimulation site in the right hemisphere in patients with chronic non-fluent aphasia. A battery of standardized language measures is administered in order to assess baseline performance. Patients are subsequently randomized to either receive real rTMS or initial sham stimulation. Patients in the real stimulation undergo a site-finding phase, comprised of a series of six rTMS sessions administered over five days; stimulation is delivered to a different site in the right frontal lobe during each of these sessions. Each site-finding session consists of 600 pulses of 1 Hz rTMS, preceded and followed by a picture-naming task. By comparing the degree of transient change in naming ability elicited by stimulation of candidate sites, we are able to locate the area of optimal response for each individual patient. We then administer rTMS to this site during the treatment phase. During treatment, patients undergo a total of ten days of stimulation over the span of two weeks; each session is comprised of 20 min of 1 Hz rTMS delivered at 90% resting motor threshold. Stimulation is paired with an fMRI-naming task on the first and last days of treatment. After the treatment phase is complete, the language battery obtained at baseline is repeated two and six months following stimulation in order to identify rTMS-induced changes in performance. The fMRI-naming task is also repeated two and six months following treatment. Patients who are randomized to the sham arm of the study undergo sham site-finding, sham treatment, fMRI-naming studies, and repeat language testing two months after completing sham treatment.

Recent findings provide evidence that even dangerous objects can modulate the motor system evoking aversive affordances. This sounds intriguing since so far the majority of behavioral, brain imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies with painful and dangerous stimuli strictly concerned the domain of pain, with the exception of evidence suggesting sensitivity to objects' affordances when neutral objects are located in participants' peripersonal space. This study investigates whether the observation of a neutral or dangerous object in a static or dynamic situation differently influences motor responses, and the time-course of the dangerous objects' processing. In three experiments we manipulated: object dangerousness (neutral vs. dangerous); object category (artifact vs. natural); manual response typology (press vs. release a key); object presentation (Experiment 1: dynamic, Experiments 2 and 3: static); object movement direction (Experiment 1: away vs. toward the participant) or size (Experiments 2 and 3: big vs. normal vs. small). The task required participants to decide whether the object was an artifact or a natural object, by pressing or releasing one key. Results showed a facilitation for neutral over dangerous objects in the static situation, probably due to an affordance effect. Instead, in the dynamic condition responses were modulated by the object movement direction, with a dynamic affordance effect elicited by neutral objects and an escape-avoidance effect provoked by dangerous objects (neutral objects were processed faster when they moved toward-approached the participant, whereas dangerous objects were processed faster when they moved away from the participant). Moreover, static stimuli influenced the manual response typology.

Typically, in the human motor system, such cortical modulations are inferred through changes in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs). However, it is now possible to directly evaluate tDCS-induced changes at the cortical level by recording the transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials (TEPs) using electroencephalography (EEG). The present study investigated the modulation induced by the tDCS on the motor system. The study evaluates changes in the MEPs, in the amplitude and distribution of the TEPs, in resting state oscillatory brain activity and in behavioural performance in a simple manual response task. Both the short- and long-term tDCS effects were investigated by evaluating their time course at ~0 and 30 minutes after tDCS. Anodal tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (M1) induced an enhancement of corticospinal excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation produced a reduction. These changes in excitability were indexed by changes in MEP amplitude. More interestingly, tDCS modulated the cortical reactivity, which is the neuronal activity evoked by TMS, in a polarity-dependent and site-specific manner. Cortical reactivity increased after anodal stimulation over the left M1, whereas it decreased with cathodal stimulation. These effects were partially present also at long term evaluation. No polarity-specific effect was found either on behavioral measures or on oscillatory brain activity. The latter showed a general increase in the power density of low frequency oscillations (theta and alpha) at both stimulation polarities.

Both REMS and psychosis course with internally generated perceptions and lack of rational judgment, which is attributed to a hyperlimbic activity along with hypofrontality. Interestingly, some individuals can become aware of dreaming during REMS, a particular experience known as lucid dreaming (LD), whose neurobiological basis is still controversial. Since the frontal lobe plays a role in self-consciousness, working memory and attention, here we hypothesize that LD is associated with increased frontal activity during REMS. A possible way to test this hypothesis is to check whether transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation of the frontal region during REMS triggers LD. We further suggest that psychosis and LD are opposite phenomena: LD as a physiological awakening while dreaming due to frontal activity, and psychosis as a pathological intrusion of dream features during wake state due to hypofrontality. We further suggest that LD research may have three main clinical implications. First, LD could be important to the study of consciousness, including its pathologies and other altered states. Second, LD could be used as a therapy for recurrent nightmares, a common symptom of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Finally, LD may allow for motor imagery during dreaming with possible improvement of physical rehabilitation.

In this study, we investigated the interaction of these techniques in affecting tactile acuity and cortical excitability, measured with somatosensory evoked potentials after paired median nerve stimulation. We first applied a session of 5-Hz rTMS, followed by a session of tactile repetitive stimulation, consisting of intermittent high-frequency tactile stimulation (iHFS) to a group of 15 healthy volunteers (\"rTMS\u00a0+\u00a0iHFS\" group). In a second group (\"rTMS w/o iHFS\"), rTMS was applied without iHFS, with a third assessment performed after a similar wait period. In the rTMS w/o iHFS group, the 5-Hz rTMS induced an increase in cortical excitability that continued to build for at least 25\u00a0min after stimulation, with the effect on excitability after the wait period being inversely correlated to the baseline state. In the rTMS\u00a0+\u00a0iHFS group, the second intervention prevented the continued increase in excitability after rTMS. In contrast to the effect on cortical excitability, rTMS produced an improvement in tactile acuity that remained stable until the last assessment, independent of the presence or absence of iHFS.

Both active conditions were compared to sham rTMS within a randomized and counterbalanced cross-over design in one day. ERPs were recorded during task performance and the N2 and the P3 were analysed. After 1 Hz rTMS of the left DLPFC (but not of the MPFC), an inhibitory effect on the N2 amplitude was observed, which was related to inhibitory control. In contrast, after 1 Hz rTMS of the MPFC (but not at the left DLPFC) a trend towards an increased P3 amplitude was found. There was no significant modulation of latencies and behavioural data. The results argue in favour of an inhibitory effect of 1 Hz rTMS on N2 amplitudes in a GoNogo task.

The main limitations of current ASR are mainly evident in the realistic use of such systems. These limitations can be partly reduced by using normalization strategies that minimize inter-speaker variability by either explicitly removing speakers' peculiarities or adapting different speakers to a reference model. In this paper we aim at modeling a motor-based imitation learning mechanism in ASR. We tested the utility of a speaker normalization strategy that uses motor representations of speech and compare it with strategies that ignore the motor domain. Specifically, we first trained a regressor through state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to build an auditory-motor mapping, in a sense mimicking a human learner that tries to reproduce utterances produced by other speakers. This auditory-motor mapping maps the speech acoustics of a speaker into the motor plans of a reference speaker. Since, during recognition, only speech acoustics are available, the mapping is necessary to \"recover\" motor information. Subsequently, in a phone classification task, we tested the system on either one of the speakers that was used during training or a new one.

The cerebellum influences sensorimotor adaptation by modulating sensorimotor plasticity of the primary motor cortex. Motor cortex sensorimotor plasticity is maladaptive in patients with writer's cramp. Here we examined whether putative cerebellar dysfunction in dystonia is linked to these patients' maladaptive plasticity. To that end we compared the performances of patients and healthy control subjects in a reaching task involving a visuomotor conflict generated by imposing a random deviation (-40\u00b0 to 40\u00b0) on the direction of movement of the mouse/cursor. Such a task is known to involve the cerebellum. We also compared, between patients and healthy control subjects, how the cerebellum modulates the extent and duration of an ongoing sensorimotor plasticity in the motor cortex. The cerebellar cortex was excited or inhibited by means of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation before artificial sensorimotor plasticity was induced in the motor cortex by paired associative stimulation. Patients with writer's cramp were slower than the healthy control subjects to reach the target and, after having repeatedly adapted their trajectories to the deviations, they were less efficient than the healthy control subjects to perform reaching movement without imposed deviation. It was interpreted as impaired washing-out abilities. In healthy subjects, cerebellar cortex excitation prevented the paired associative stimulation to induce a sensorimotor plasticity in the primary motor cortex, whereas cerebellar cortex inhibition led the paired associative stimulation to be more efficient in inducing the plasticity. In patients with writer's cramp, cerebellar cortex excitation and inhibition were both ineffective in modulating sensorimotor plasticity. In patients with writer's cramp, but not in healthy subjects, behavioural parameters reflecting their capacity for adapting to the rotation and for washing-out of an earlier adaptation predicted the efficacy of inhibitory cerebellar conditioning to influence sensorimotor plasticity: the better the online adaptation, the smaller the influence of cerebellar inhibitory stimulation on motor cortex plasticity. Altered cerebellar encoding of incoming afferent volleys may result in decoupling the motor component from the afferent information flow, and also in maladjusted sensorimotor calibration. The loss of cerebellar control over sensorimotor plasticity might also lead to building up an incorrect motor program to specific adaptation tasks such as writing.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Neuron specific enolase and serum remain unaffected by ultra high frequency left prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with depression: a preliminary study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16808997", "authors": ["M\u00fcller, HH", "Reulbach, U", "Maler, JM", "Kornhuber, J", "Sperling, W"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Application of magnetic or electrical stimulation to the motor cortex can result in a period of electromyography (EMG) silence in a tonically active peripheral muscle.

Here, we use the multimodal neuroimaging technique of TMS-EMG combined with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recording to further examine the cortical origin of SP and the cortical oscillatory activity that underlies SP genesis. We demonstrate that the duration of SP is related to the temporal characteristics of the cortical reactivity and the power of delta to alpha oscillations in both local and remote areas ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulation site, and beta oscillations locally. We illustrate that, compared to EMG, the EEG indices of the SP provide additional information about the brain dynamics and propose that the EEG measures of SP may be used in future clinical and research investigations to more precisely delineate the mechanisms underlying inhibitory impairments.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Facilitative effects of VNS on the motor threshold: implications for its antidepressive mode of action?", "issue": "", "pmid": "11723286", "authors": ["Matsugi, A", "Kamata, N", "Tanaka, T", "Hiraoka, K"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Neurophysiological measurement techniques like fMRI and TMS are increasingly being used to examine the perceptual-motor processes underpinning the ability to anticipate the actions of others. Crucially, these techniques invariably restrict the experimental task that can be used and consequently limit the degree to which the findings can be generalised. These limitations are discussed based on a recent paper by Tomeo et al. (2012) who sought to examine responses to fooling actions by using TMS on participants who passively observed spliced video clips where bodily information was, and was not, linked to the action outcome. We outline two particular concerns with this approach. First, spliced video clips that show physically impossible actions are unlikely to simulate a \"fooling\" action. Second, it is difficult to make meaningful inferences about perceptual-motor expertise from experiments where participants cannot move. Taken together, we argue that wider generalisations based on these findings may provide a misunderstanding of the phenomenon such a study is designed to explore.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Long latency fluctuation of the finger movement evoked by cerebellar TMS during visually guided manual tracking task.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "23815455", "authors": ["Enticott, PG", "Kennedy, HA", "Rinehart, NJ", "Bradshaw, JL", "Tonge, BJ", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "", "journal": "Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "abstract": "The short-term effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the patients with catastrophic and intractable tinnitus were investigated.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Interpersonal motor resonance in autism spectrum disorder: evidence against a global \"mirror system\" deficit.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23814845", "authors": ["Cabrera, LY", "Evans, EL", "Hamilton, RH"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Fifteen participants were recruited among patients with catastrophic intractable tinnitus to receive 1 Hz rTMS treatment.

During 15 days of hospitalization, each patient received 10 sessions of 40-min bihemispheric rTMS and 240-min intensive OT (120-min one-to-one training and 120-min self-training). One session of bihemispheric rTMS comprised the application of both 1 and 10 Hz rTMS (2000 stimuli for each hemisphere). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, and the Modified Ashworth Scale were administered on the day of admission and at discharge. All patients completed the treatment without any adverse effects. Motor function of the affected upper limb improved significantly, on the basis of changes in Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Wolf Motor Function Test (P<0.05, each). A significant decrease in the Modified Ashworth Scale score was noted in the elbow, wrist, and finger flexors of the affected upper limb (P<0.05, each). The combination of bihemispheric rTMS and intensive OT was safe and feasible therapy for poststroke hemiparetic patients, and improved motor function of the hemiparetic upper limb in poststroke patients.

Der Fugl-Meyer-Score, der motorische Funktionstest nach Wolf und die modifizierte Ashworth-Skala wurden am Tag der Aufnahme und Entlassung angewendet. Alle Patienten schlossen die Behandlung ohne unerw\u00fcnschte Ereignisse ab. Die motorische Funktion der betroffenen oberen Extremit\u00e4t wies ausgehend von den Ver\u00e4nderungen beim Fugl-Meyer-Score und beim motorischen Funktionstest nach Wolf (je P<0.05) eine signifikante Verbesserung auf. Eine signifikante Abnahme des Scores bei der modifizierten Ashworth-Skala wurde bei den Ellbogen-, Handgelenks- und Fingerbeugern in der betroffenen oberen Extremit\u00e4t beobachtet (je P<0.05). Die Kombination bihemisph\u00e4rischer rTMS und intensiver Ergotherapie war eine sichere und durchf\u00fchrbare Therapie bei hemiparetischen Patienten nach Schlaganfall, die die motorische Funktion der hemiparetischen oberen Extremit\u00e4t verbesserte.

En el estudio participaron ocho sujetos con ictus y hemiparesia del miembro superior (edad en el momento de la intervenci\u00f3n: 62.8\u00b14.9 a\u00f1os, tiempo transcurrido tras el ictus: 84.3\u00b187.2 meses, media\u00b1DE). A lo largo de 15 d\u00edas de hospitalizaci\u00f3n, cada uno de los pacientes recibi\u00f3 10 sesiones de EMTr bihemisf\u00e9rica de 40 minutos y TO de 240 minutos (120 minutos de terapia individual y 120 minutos de autoterapia). En una sesi\u00f3n de EMTr bihemisf\u00e9rica se aplicaba una EMTr de 1 y 10 Hz (2000 est\u00edmulos para cada hemisferio). La puntuaci\u00f3n Fugl-Meyer, la prueba de funci\u00f3n motora de Wolf y la Escala modificada de Ashworth fueron llevadas a cabo en el d\u00eda de la admisi\u00f3n y en el momento del alta. Todos los pacientes finalizaron el tratamiento sin presentar ning\u00fan efecto adverso. Se observ\u00f3 una mejora significativa de la funci\u00f3n motora del miembro superior afectado, de acuerdo con la puntuaci\u00f3n Fugl-Meyer y la prueba de funci\u00f3n motora de Wolf (P<0.05, respectivamente).
