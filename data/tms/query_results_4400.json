ECT remains an important treatment option for depression in the elderly, especially those with depression and reversible dementia. Other indications classically considered, although for fewer patients and never as first-line treatment, are difficult-to-treat patients whose acute mania, mixed mania, schizo-affective state or schizophrenia has failed to respond to an adequate dose of psychotropic drugs and can be considered drug-refractory.

Following vibration, MEP amplitude at the optimal stimulation position, motor output area, as well as map volume, increased significantly for the ECR.

Neuroimaging studies have identified left ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) and left superior temporal-parietal (STP) activation during rhythmic auditory-motor synchronization.

Subthreshold rTMS was administered separately to the left vPMC and STP at a frequency of 0.9Hz for 15 min. Phase synchronization error (difference between auditory stimulus and response onsets) significantly increased after rTMS to STP as compared to baseline. Synchronization error also increased after rTMS to vPMC as compared to baseline, but not significantly. Absolute period error, (absolute difference between metronome interval and response interval) was not affected by rTMS.

However, association cortices also receive, albeit weak, direct thalamocortical sensory inputs of unknown function. For example, while information proceeds from primary (SI) to secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex in a serial fashion, both areas are known to receive direct thalamocortical sensory input. The present study examines the potential roles of such parallel input arrangements. The subjects were presented with median nerve somatosensory stimuli with the instruction to respond with the contralateral hand. The locations and time courses of the activated brain areas were first identified with magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a subsequent session, these brain areas were modulated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 15-210 ms after the somatosensory stimulus while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. TMS pulses at 15-40 ms post-stimulus significantly speeded up reaction times and somatosensory-evoked responses, with largest facilitatory effects when the TMS pulse was given to contralateral SII at about 20 ms. To explain the results, we propose that the early somatosensory-evoked physiological SII activation exerts an SII-->SI influence that facilitates the reciprocal SI-->SII pathway - with TMS to SII we apparently amplified this mechanism. The results suggest that the human brain may utilize parallel inputs to facilitate long-distance cortico-cortical connections, resulting in accelerated processing and speeded reaction times.

To address this question we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyographic (EMG) recordings of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Compared with previous TMS studies, where changes in excitability might be related to both cortical and spinal mechanisms, our setup allowed a more direct evaluation of the cortical processes related to the performance of unilateral movements. EEG responses showed that the unilateral motor reactions were associated with the bilateral increase in the excitability of sensorimotor cortices. However, this increase was smaller in the ipsilateral hemisphere most likely due to the fact that the excitation in ipsilateral hemisphere coincided with additional inhibitory processes related to the suppression of mirror movements. This explanation was further corroborated by showing that only contralateral changes in cortical excitability led to the increase in the amplitude of peripheral MEPs, while neuronal activation in the ipsilateral hemisphere was not associated with the changes in the muscle responses. These results suggest that the increased excitability in the ipsilateral hemisphere was uncoupled from the modulation of the cortico-spinal output. Moreover, we show that the background neuronal activity during unilateral movements was different in the ipsi- and contralateral hemisphere. This difference most likely reflects inter-hemispheric balance between the excitation and inhibition which is required for the optimal performance of the unilateral movement.", "pages": "337-44"}, {"volume": "435", "title": "Primary motor cortex activation by transcranial direct current stimulation in the human brain.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17644413", "authors": ["Kwon, YH", "Ko, MH", "Ahn, SH", "Kim, YH", "Song, JC", "Lee, CH", "Chang, MC", "Jang, SH"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Most of our impressions of the world and our memory are based on sight.

The posterior limb of the internal capsule, where fast-conducting corticospinal fibres from M1(Hand) pass through, showed only a weak linear relationship between FA and MT. The FA measurements show that a high level of corticospinal excitability is associated with a higher fibre coherence in large parts of cerebral white matter.

Similarly, suppression of V5/MT activity using off-line 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) disrupted performance in a subsequent motion-detection task. However, paradoxically, on-line V5/MT TMS had a facilitatory effect on motion detection if V5/MT had been suppressed by off-line 1-Hz rTMS prior to the motion-detection task.

Subjects performed three independent experiments (1-back and 2-back tasks) while rTMS was applied over dlPFC for 500 ms in the last period of the delay. In two experiments (1 and 2) physically identical stimuli (letters shown at different locations on a screen) under different domain conditions (letters or locations) were employed. Under these conditions, we discovered a double dissociation only in the 2-back task: during the letter condition, when applied to the right dlPFC, rTMS significantly delayed task performance, whereas, the same result was present during the location condition, but only when rTMS was applied to the left dlPFC. The other 2-back task (experiment 3), in which we had eliminated the task-irrelevant information (i.e. we used stimuli that varied only in one domain), did not show significant results. We propose that the functional dichotomy of the hemispheres may be due to mechanisms of cognitive control on interference, which resolve conflict through the inhibition of task-irrelevant information only during high WM load.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that cortico-cortical coherence between distant brain areas can be selectively enhanced by synchronous bifocal rTMS. Cortico-cortical coherence was assessed in 16 healthy human subjects before and after three trains of synchronous high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS to the left primary motor cortex and the visual cortex at the occipital pole simultaneously. Stimulation of the left M1 alone served as the control condition. Coherence and spectral power were measured between these areas on the stimulated and the homologue contralateral side. Synchronous bifocal rTMS induced an increase of interregional coupling in the alpha and lower beta band on the stimulated side without effects on spectral power. These data indicate that synchronous bifocal rTMS is a feasible technique for selective modulation of interregional EEG coherence.

In contrast, paired TN stimulation produced a depression of the reflex response to the second stimulus. Direct activation of the pyramidal tract did not facilitate a second response, suggesting that the MEP facilitation observed using paired TMS occurred in the cortex. A TN stimulus also depressed a subsequent MEP. Since the TN stimulus depressed both inputs, the mechanism is probably post-synaptic, such as afterhyperpolarization of motor neurons. Presynaptic mechanisms, such as homosynaptic depression, would only affect the pathway used as a conditioning stimulus. When TN and TMS pulses were paired, the largest facilitation occurred when TMS preceded TN by about 5 ms, which is optimal for summation of the two pathways at the level of the spinal motor neurons. A later, smaller facilitation occurred when a single TN stimulus preceded TMS by 50-60 ms, an interval that allows enough time for the sensory afferent input to reach the sensory cortex and be relayed to the motor cortex.

In this study we investigated whether aspects of brain activity during a motor task were influenced not only by age, but also by neurophysiological parameters of the motor cortex contralateral to the moving hand. Twenty seven right-handed volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging whilst performing repetitive isometric right hand grips in which the target force was parametrically varied between 15 and 55% of each subject's own maximum grip force. For each subject we characterised two orthogonal parameters, B(G) (average task-related activity for all hand grips) and B(F) (the degree to which task-related activity co-varied with peak grip force). We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess task-related changes in interhemispheric inhibition from left to right motor cortex (IHIc) and to perform measures relating to left motor cortex excitability during activation of the right hand. Firstly, we found that B(G) in right (ipsilateral) motor cortex was greater with increasing values of age(2) and IHIc. Secondly, B(F) in left ventral premotor cortex was greater in older subjects and in those in whom contralateral M1 was less responsive to TMS stimulation. In both cases, neurophysiological parameters accounted for variability in brain responses over and above that explained by ageing. These results indicate that neurophysiological markers may be better indicators of biological ageing than chronological age and point towards the mechanisms by which reconfiguration of distributed brain networks occurs in the face of degenerative changes.", "pages": "337-44"}]
