Here, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the parietal cortices during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants were solving visuospatial tasks. This allowed us to observe both the behavioral and the neural effects of transient parietal activity disruption in the active healthy human brain. Our results show that right, but not left, parietal TMS impairs visuospatial judgment, induces neural activity changes in a specific right-hemispheric network of frontoparietal regions, and shows significant correlations between the induced behavioral impairment and neural activity changes in both the directly stimulated parietal and remote ipsilateral frontal brain regions. The revealed right-hemispheric neural network effect of parietal TMS represents the same brain areas that are functionally connected during the execution of visuospatial judgments. This corroborates the notion that visuospatial deficits following parietal damage are brought about by a perturbation of activity across a specific frontoparietal network, rather than the lesioned parietal site alone. Our experiments furthermore show how concurrent fMRI and magnetic brain stimulation during active task execution hold the potential to identify and visualize networks of brain areas that are functionally related to specific cognitive processes.", "pages": "R170-2"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation: a computer-based human model study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17337745", "authors": ["Wagner, T", "Fregni, F", "Fecteau, S", "Grodzinsky, A", "Zahn, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Interest in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in clinical practice has been growing, however, the knowledge about its efficacy and mechanisms of action remains limited.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to assess the balance between inhibitory and excitatory processes involved in the regulation of motor cortex activity and thereby, may be of value to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of myoclonus. Using paired-pulse paradigms with various interstimulus intervals, TMS studies showed that intracortical inhibition (ICI) was reduced in progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). In contrast, ICI was decreased only for short interstimulus intervals in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Transcallosal inhibition and sensorimotor integration were also both altered in PME but not in JME. Actually, the loss of inhibitory regulation within the central nervous system might represent an intrinsic mechanism of myoclonus, whether of epileptic origin or not. Finally, the other TMS parameters of excitability (motor threshold, silent period, intracortical facilitation) were found normal in most cases of myoclonus. According to these observations, it was quite conceivable that the application of repetitive trains of TMS (rTMS) at inhibitory low-frequency (around 1 Hz) might be able to relieve myoclonus by restoring ICI. A few reported cases illustrate the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS to alleviate myoclonic symptoms. Therapeutic-like perspectives are opened for rTMS in these forms of myoclonus that are related to motor cortical hyperexcitability secondary to the loss of ICI.", "pages": "R170-2"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Treatment-emergent mania in unipolar and bipolar depression: focus on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17336097", "authors": ["Xia, G", "Gajwani, P", "Muzina, DJ", "Kemp, DE", "Gao, K", "Ganocy, SJ", "Calabrese, JR"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)", "abstract": "Myoclonus can be diagnosed and classified mainly based on clinical features.

The pooled TEM rate is 0.84% for the active treatment group and 0.73% for the sham group. The difference is not statistically significant. Along with case reports, a total of 13 cases of TEM associated with rTMS treatment of depression have been published. Most of these patients were diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the majority of patients experiencing TEM took medication concurrent with rTMS. The parameters of rTMS used in these cases were scattered over the spectrum of major parameters explored in previous studies. Most train durations and intervals were within the published safety guidelines of the field. Reducing the frequency of sessions from two per day to one per day might be associated with a lower likelihood of TEM recurrence. The severity of manic symptoms varied significantly, but all cases responded to treatment that included a decrease or discontinuation of antidepressant and/or rTMS treatment and/or use of anti-manic medication. Current data suggests that rTMS treatment carries a slight risk of TEM that is not statistically higher than that associated with sham treatment.

Using two variants of a cued reaction time (RT) task, we set out to investigate whether high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; 5 Hz) delivered \"off-line\" in a virtual lesion paradigm over the right or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) would affect performance in a motor versus a visual attention task. Although rTMS over the DLPFC on either side did not affect RT performance on a spatial orienting task, it did lead to an increase in the RTs of invalidly cued trials in a motor attention task when delivered to the left DLPFC. The opposite effect was found when rTMS was delivered to the PPC: In this case, conditioning the right PPC led to increased RTs in invalidly cued trials located in the left hemispace, in the spatial orienting task. rTMS over the PPC on either side did not affect performance in the motor attention task. This double dissociation was evident in the first 10 min after rTMS conditioning. These results enhance our understanding of the networks associated with attention.

This anticipatory modulation may reflect transmission of inputs to human primary motor cortex (M1) for visuomotor guidance of hand shape. Conversely, single-pulse TMS is known to suppress MEPs during movement preparation. Here we investigate the time course of single- and paired-pulse MEP modulation. TMS was delivered over M1, at different time intervals after visual presentation of either a handle or a disc to healthy subjects. Participants were instructed to view the object, and later to grasp it when given a cue. During grasp there was a specific pattern of hand muscle activity according to the object grasped. MEPs were evoked in these muscles by TMS delivered prior to grasp. Paired-pulse MEPs were facilitated, whilst single-pulse MEPs were suppressed. The pattern of facilitation matched the object-specific pattern of muscle activity for TMS pulses delivered 150 ms or more after object presentation. However, this effect was not present when TMS was delivered immediately after object presentation, or if the delivery of TMS was given separately from the cue to perform the grasp action.

In 19 rats, TMS evoked responses bilaterally in forelimb (biceps brachii; BB) and hindlimb muscles (tibialis anterior). The latency and amplitude of these motor-evoked responses (MEPs) were highly variable and depended strongly on the coil position and the stimulation intensity. The most frequently observed latencies for the BB MEPs could be divided into three groups: 3-6 ms, 8-12 ms and 14-18 ms. Lesions in the dorsal columns, which destroyed the corticospinal tract at C2 and C5, significantly depressed MEPs in the mid- and high-latency ranges, but not those in the low-latency range. Lesions in the dorsolateral funiculus, which interrupted the rubrospinal tract, had no effect on MEPs in any of the latency ranges. By contrast, bilateral lesion of the reticulospinal tract and other ventro-laterally located descending pathways abolished all responses. Intracellular recordings from 54 cervical motoneurons in five rats revealed that TMS evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at latencies that corresponded well with those of the BB MEPs. The short-latency EPSPs had rise times of around 1 ms, suggesting that they were mediated by a monosynaptic pathway. EPSPs with longer latencies had considerably longer rise times, which indicated conduction through polysynaptic pathways. Selective electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract in the brainstem was performed in seven rats, where intracellular recordings from 70 motoneurons revealed that the earliest EPSPs and MEPs evoked by TMS were not mediated by the corticospinal tract, but by other descending motor pathways. Together, these results showed that in the rat TMS activates several descending pathways that converge on common spinal interneurons and motoneurons.

We evaluated the electrophysiological reaction to magnetic stimulation during and 2-4 s after 20 trains of 20-pulses rTMS, using event-related power (ERPow) that reflects the regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies, and event-related coherence (ERCoh) that reflects the interregional functional connectivity of oscillatory neural activity.

For the alpha band, threshold rTMS and subthreshold rTMS induced an ERPow increase during the trains of stimulation mainly in frontal and central regions ipsilateral to stimulation. For the beta band, a similar synchronization of cortical oscillations for both rTMS intensities was seen. Moreover, subthreshold rTMS affected alpha-band activity more than threshold rTMS, inducing a specific ERCoh decrease over the posterior regions during the trains of stimulation.

Even in MS patients with no or minor neurological signs (ND group), MEP parameters showed differences from controls and furthermore all MEP parameters were significantly different in the D group compared with the ND group. The 75% of the patients had an amplitude or area alteration; this percentage was significantly higher than the percentage of patients with a CMCT alteration (56.2%). In addition, CMCT increase was always associated with reduced amplitude and area, but amplitude and area alterations were present also in patients with normal CMCT. In early stages of MS, the higher percentage shown in alteration of MEP amplitudes and areas as opposed to CMCTs has not previously been highlighted in the literature.

For patients with continuous hallucinations (N = 8) correlations between BOLD signal time course in Wernicke's area, and other regions were used to map functional coupling to the former. These maps were used to identify 3-6 cortical sites per patient that were probed with 1-Hz rTMS and sham stimulation. Delivering rTMS to left temporoparietal sites in Wernicke's area and the adjacent supramarginal gyrus was accompanied by a greater rate of AVH improvement compared with sham stimulation and rTMS delivered to anterior temporal sites. For intermittent hallucinators, lower levels of hallucination-related activation in Broca's area strongly predicted greater rate of response to left temporoparietal rTMS. For continuous hallucinators, reduced coupling between Wernicke's and a right homologue of Broca's area strongly predicted greater left temporoparietal rTMS rate of response.

IHI significantly increased intracortical facilitation in PD-MM and PD-NM patients, but not in normal subjects. Our results suggest that MM in PD is due to activation of the contralateral motor cortex. PD-MM patients had reduced transcallosal inhibitory effects on cortical output neurons and on intracortical inhibitory circuits compared to PD-NM patients and controls. These deficits in transcallosal inhibition may contribute to MM in PD patients.", "pages": "R170-2"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Task-dependent modulation of functional connectivity between hand motor cortices and neuronal networks underlying language and music: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in humans.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "7119878", "authors": ["Sparing, R", "Meister, IG", "Wienemann, M", "Buelte, D", "Staedtgen, M", "Boroojerdi, B"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Visual information is crucial for goal-directed reaching. A number of studies have recently shown that motion in particular is an important source of information for the visuomotor system. For example, when reaching a stationary object, movement of the background can influence the trajectory of the hand, even when the background motion is irrelevant to the object and task. This manual following response may be a compensatory response to changes in body position, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we tested whether visual motion area MT+ is necessary to generate the manual following response. We found that stimulation of MT+ with transcranial magnetic stimulation significantly reduced a strong manual following response. MT+ is therefore necessary for generating the manual following response, indicating that it plays a crucial role in guiding goal-directed reaching movements by taking into account background motion in scenes.", "pages": "R170-2"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Emotion facilitates action: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study of motor cortex excitability during picture viewing.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "2858101", "authors": ["Hajcak, G", "Molnar, C", "George, MS", "Bolger, K", "Koola, J", "Nahas, Z"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Psychophysiology", "abstract": "There is some evidence that handedness is related to lateralisation of excitability in the motor system.

Because there is some controversy as to the optimal localisation to produce IHI we also compared IHI induced by conditioning the dorsal premotor cortex (dPM) versus primary motor cortex (M1) in ten RH. IHI was stronger following conditioning the motor dominant as compared to the motor non-dominant hemisphere in RH and LH. Motor thresholds were higher when elicited over the right hemisphere than over the left in both RH and LH, while SICI and SICF showed no differences between hemispheres or dependency from handedness.

Stimulation of the motor pathway may contribute to faster improvement in patients with spinal cord injury. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease (such as cognition and working memory, neglect syndrome and global aphasia) can be influenced by rTMS. However, the site of stimulation and the parameters of rTMS are different.

An established body of evidence suggests that mechanisms of spatial attention operate both within and between sensory modalities; however the attentional mechanisms that link modalities in the human brain are unclear. Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the role of the parietal cortex in coordinating reflexive shifts of spatial attention between vision and touch. In two experiments, healthy participants localised visual and somatosensory targets that were preceded by non-informative visual or somatosensory spatial cues. To determine the role of parietal cortex in spatial orienting, TMS was delivered synchronously with cue onset for 100 ms. Results revealed a critical role of the right angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus in reflexive orienting to visual and somatosensory targets that followed a somatosensory cue. In contrast, the same TMS protocol was ineffective in modulating reflexive orienting based on visual cues. This dependence on cue modality may reflect subcortical redundancy of visual orienting mechanisms.

Functional neuroimaging results, studies on patients with posterior parietal cortex (PPC) lesions, and single-unit recordings in the lateral intraparietal sulcus of primates indirectly suggest that the PPC might be a potential locus of visual stability through its involvement with spatial remapping. Here we directly explored the role of the PPC in visual stability by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while participants performed a perisaccadic displacement detection task. We show that TMS over the PPC but not a frontal control site alters sensitivity to displacement detection when administered just before contralateral saccades and that a general impairment in attention or in the perception of apparent motion cannot account for the decreased sensitivity. The specific relationship between the timing of TMS and saccade direction demonstrates that saccadic suppression of displacement (SSD) is likely a consequence of noisy contralateral spatial representations in the PPC around the time of a saccade. The same mechanism may keep the unstable visual world in the temporal proximity of saccades from reaching our consciousness.", "pages": "R170-2"}]
