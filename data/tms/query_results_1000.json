Cluster headache will also be discussed, as there are some future treatments for acute care and prevention being studied at present. For the acute care of migraine in the US, we have seven triptans by tablet plus other routes and one non steroidal anti-inflammatory medication approved by the FDA that is currently available (Cambia brand of buffered diclofenac potassium for oral solution). There are several other acute care medications in various stages of development and there are three new methods of administering a triptan and others under investigation. The optimal acute care therapy for migraine should be faster, easier to use and more efficient with fewer adverse events than what is currently available. What follows is a brief review of the status in development for five of the many new acute care medications being investigated: the CGRP antagonist tablet telcagepant, the sumatriptan iontophoretic patch Zelrix, sumatriptan powder for use in the OptiNose apparatus, dihydroergotamine for oral inhalation (Levadex), civamide nasal solution for prevention of episodic cluster headache (Civanex) and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation for acute cluster attacks in chronic cluster headaches.

This is specially the case when using the double-cone coil to obtain the motor evoked potentials in leg muscles. Even if intensity is kept below threshold for the soleus muscle, TMS induces facilitation of the soleus H reflex that is separated into two phases: the first, peaking at 10-20\u00a0ms and the second, peaking at 70-90\u00a0ms. We investigated the possibility that TMS-induced facilitation of the H reflex was related, at least in part, to the reafferentation volley reaching the alpha motoneuron after synchronized contraction of other muscles in the body. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of vibration on the TMS-induced facilitation of the soleus H reflex. As expected, vibration applied over the triceps tendon caused a significant reduction in H reflex amplitude: 42.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0% of control values. When conditioned by TMS at intervals corresponding to the first phase, the H reflex was facilitated to the same extent in both conditions: with and without vibration. However, at intervals corresponding to the second facilitation phase, there was a significantly reduced facilitation with vibration. These differential effects of vibration on the two phases of the TMS-induced facilitation of the H reflex indicate a different mechanism for each facilitation phase. The first phase could result from direct corticospinal excitatory input, while the second phase might depend on inputs via Ia afferents from heteronymous muscles.", "pages": "1327-37"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "A comparison of two different continuous theta burst stimulation paradigms applied to the human primary motor cortex.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "22633979", "authors": ["Goldsworthy, MR", "Pitcher, JB", "Ridding, MC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We investigated the functional changes in short intracortical inhibitory (SICI) circuits to determine whether surround inhibition is altered during a simple finger movement training.

The investigation of induced changes in the perception of experimental pain by NICS could help clinicians and researchers to better understand the mechanisms of action involved with these techniques and the role played by the cortex in the integration of nociceptive information. This review presents current literature data on the modulation of experimental pain perception by cortical stimulation. The observations found that NICS analgesic effects depend on the method used to provoke pain (referring to the type of nerve fibers and neural circuits that are recruited to mediate pain) and the parameters of cortical stimulation (especially the nature of the cortical target). The motor cortex (precentral cortical area) is the most widely used target for pain modulation. However, other targets, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, could be of particular interest to modulate various components of pain. Further developments in NICS techniques, such as image-guided navigated brain stimulation, might lead to improvement in the beneficial effects of NICS on pain.

However, its effects over the primary motor cortex have not been examined. Due to TMS device mechanical properties, 30Hz TBS is advantageous over 50Hz TBS in that it can be delivered at higher stimulation intensities. The goal of this pilot study is to examine the neurophysiologic effects of 30Hz TBS on the primary motor cortex (M1) of healthy adults. Eighteen right-handed adults (33\u00b19.0 years; M:F=8:10) completed intermittent TBS (iTBS) or continuous TBS (cTBS) over left M1. TBS was performed with Magstim\u00ae SuperRapid2 with stimulation bursts (3 pulses at 30Hz) repeating every 200ms. For iTBS, each 2-s stimulation train was separated by 8s but there was no pause between trains for cTBS. Each TBS consisted of a total of 600 pulses delivered at an intensity of 90%*Resting Motor Threshold. Motor-Evoked Potentials (MEP) in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle were measured before, and one and ten minutes after TBS.

We aimed to investigate further this hypothesis by modulating directly prefrontal cortex excitability using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - a non-invasive, neuromodulatory tool that induces polarity-dependent changes in cortical excitability - and measuring effects on salivary cortisol and heart rate variability as proxies of the HPA and SAM systems. Twenty healthy participants with no clinical and neuropsychiatric conditions were randomized to receive bifrontal tDCS (left anodal/right cathodal or left cathodal/right anodal) or sham stimulation, in a within-subject design. During each stimulation session, after a resting period, subjects were shown images with neutral or negative valence. Our findings showed that excitability enhancing left anodal tDCS induced a decrease in cortisol levels. This effect is more pronounced during emotional negative stimuli. Moreover, vagal activity was higher during left anodal tDCS and emotional negative stimuli, as compared to sham stimulation and neutral images. We also observed an association between higher mood scores, higher vagal activation and lower cortisol levels for anodal stimulation. Subjective mood and anxiety evaluation revealed no specific changes after stimulation. Our findings suggest that tDCS induced transient, polarity specific modulatory top-down effects with anodal tDCS leading to a down-regulation of HPA and SAM systems.

This response slowing could be explained by \"automatic inhibition\" (i.e., the reinstantiation of motor suppression when a stimulus retrieves a stop association). Here we tested this using TMS. In Experiment 1, participants were trained to go or no-go to stimuli. Then, in a test phase, we compared the corticospinal excitability for go stimuli that were previously associated with stopping (no-go_then_go) with go stimuli that were previously associated with going (go_then_go). Corticospinal excitability was reduced for no-go_then_go compared with go_then_go stimuli at a mere 100 msec poststimulus. Although these results fit with automatic inhibition, there was, surprisingly, no suppression for no-go_then_no-go stimuli, although this should occur. We speculated that automatic inhibition lies within a continuum between effortful top-down response inhibition and no inhibition at all. When the need for executive control and active response suppression disappears, so does the manifestation of automatic inhibition. Therefore, it should emerge during go/no-go learning and disappear as performance asymptotes. Consistent with this idea, in Experiment 2, we demonstrated reduced corticospinal excitability for no-go versus go trials most prominently in the midphase of training but it wears off as performance asymptotes. We thus provide neurophysiological evidence for an inhibition mechanism that is automatically reinstantiated when a stimulus retrieves a learned stopping episode, but only in an executive context in which active suppression is required.

Here, we challenge this assumption by showing that cathodal stimulation will not always degrade cognitive performance. We used an attentional load paradigm in which irrelevant stimuli are processed only under low but not under high attentional load. Thirty healthy participants were randomly allocated into three interventional groups with different brain stimulation parameters (active anodal posterior parietal cortex [PPC], active cathodal PPC, and sham). Cathodal but not anodal stimulation enabled flanker processing even in high-loaded scenes. A second experiment was carried out to assert whether the improved flanker processing under cathodal stimulation is because of altered attention allocation between center and surround or, alternatively, enhanced attentional resources. In this experiment, the flanker was presented centrally. The results of Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1's finding of improved flanker processing.

Here we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to human left PMd at low or high intensity while right-handed individuals performed externally paced sequential key presses with their left hand. Movements were cued by abstract visual stimuli, and subjects either freely selected a key press or responded according to a prelearned visuomotor mapping rule. Continuous arterial spin labeling was interleaved with TMS to directly assess how stimulation of left PMd modulates task-related brain activity depending on the mode of movement selection. Relative to passive viewing, both tasks activated a frontoparietal motor network. Compared with low-intensity TMS, high-intensity TMS of left PMd was associated with an increase in activity in medial and right premotor areas without affecting task performance. Critically, this increase in task-related activity was only present when movement selection relied on arbitrary visuomotor associations but not during freely selected movements. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed a context-specific increase in functional coupling between the stimulated left PMd and remote right-hemispheric and mesial motor regions that was only present during arbitrary visuomotor mapping. Our TMS perturbation approach yielded causal evidence that the left PMd is implicated in mapping external cues onto the appropriate movement in humans. Furthermore, the data suggest that the left PMd may transiently form a functional network together with right-hemispheric and mesial motor regions to sustain visuomotor mapping performed with the left nondominant hand.", "pages": "1327-37"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Formerly known as inhibitory: effects of 1-Hz rTMS on auditory cortex are state-dependent.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18083517", "authors": ["Awiszus, F"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN", "abstract": "The relationship between sensory and transcallosal inputs into the motor cortex may be important in motor performance, but it has not been well studied, especially in humans. The aim of this study was to reveal this relationship by investigating the interaction between short-latency interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI) and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) in humans with transcranial magnetic stimulation. SIHI is the inhibition of the primary motor cortex (M1) elicited by contralateral M1 stimulation given \u223c10 ms before, and it reflects transcallosal inhibition. SAI is the inhibition of M1 elicited by contralateral median nerve stimulation preceding M1 stimulation by \u223c20 ms. In this investigation, we studied the intensity dependence of SIHI and SAI and the interaction between SIHI and SAI in various conditioning intensities. Subjects were 11 normal volunteers. The degree of effects was evaluated by comparing motor evoked potential sizes recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle between a certain condition and control condition. Both SIHI and SAI were potentiated by increment of the conditioning stimulus intensity and saturated at 1.4 times resting motor threshold for SIHI and 3 times sensory threshold for SAI. No significant interaction was observed when either of their intensities was subthreshold for the inhibition on its own. Only when both intensities were strong enough for their inhibition did the presence of one inhibition lessen the other one.

This block of observation and replication was repeated 5 times. During observation of a given hand posture (OK sign), motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded from hand muscles. In experiment 1, the OK sign appeared in the 9th position of the sequence. Almost all participants could replicate the OK sign only at the 5th block of the experiment.

This suggested that during observational learning of sequential hand postures MEP changed with the progress of the learning. To evaluate this idea, we performed two additional experiments.

The effect of an acute dose of levodopa on cortical plasticity reported so far is variable. In this study, it was hypothesized that cortical plasticity would be restored in Parkinson's disease as a long duration response to treatment in stable responders while those with motor complications would have a reduction or loss of plasticity similar to the decay of long duration response of motor signs. Patients were carefully stratified based on their motor response to levodopa into stable responders (n=17), fluctuating non-dyskinetics (n=18) and fluctuating dyskinetics (n=20). Theta burst stimulation was applied to the motor cortex to induce long-term potentiation and long-term depression-like plasticity in both OFF and ON conditions. In OFF, stable responders could express both types of plasticity, fluctuating non-dyskinetics had long-term potentiation, but no long-term depression and both types of plasticity were lost in fluctuating dyskinetics. This suggests the presence of a long duration response in early stages of levodopa treatment and a gradual loss of chronic treatment benefit on plasticity, particularly for long-term depression, when motor complications develop. An acute dose of levodopa led to a worsening of long-term potentiation in fluctuating non-dyskinetic patients, and it did not have any effect on the plasticity that was absent in OFF in the fluctuating dyskinetic patients. Acute dosing led to a worsening of long-term depression in all the groups. In the fluctuating dyskinetic patients, there was a paradoxical potentiation instead of depression. Our results suggest that an acute non-physiological dopamine boost has a negative effect on cortical plasticity as disease advances. We propose that the loss of long duration response and the negative effect of acute doses on cortical plasticity with progression of disease may contribute to the pathophysiology of motor complications. Repeated non-physiological surges in synaptic dopamine during acute levodopa dosing could potentially lead to persistent dysfunction of key enzymes of the intracellular signalling cascade that are involved in the induction and maintenance of both forms of plasticity.", "pages": "1327-37"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Commentary on: Deng et al., Electric field depth-focality tradeoff in transcranial magnetic stimulation: simulation comparison of 50 coil designs.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "12419133", "authors": ["Arias, P", "Robles-Garc\u00eda, V", "Espinosa, N", "Corral, Y", "Cudeiro, J"], "year": "2013", "journal": "European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists", "abstract": "Cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways dysfunction is involved in pathological oscillations causing tremor in essential tremor (ET).
