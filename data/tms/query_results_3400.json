However, little is known about how volitional motor activity would modulate the ISP. Here we tested in 30 healthy adults to what extent and under what conditions voluntary activation of the stimulated right M1 by moving the left hand strengthens interhemispheric inhibition as indexed by an enhancement of the ISP area in the maximally contracting right first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Left index finger abduction, already at low levels of contraction, significantly enhanced the ISP compared to left hand at rest. Even imagination of left index finger movement enhanced the ISP compared to rest or mental calculation. This enhancement occurred in the absence of motor-evoked potential amplitude modulation in the left FDI, thus excluding a non-specific contribution from an increase in right M1 corticospinal excitability. Contraction of the left extensor indicis, but not contraction of more proximal left upper limb or left or right lower limb muscles also enhanced the ISP. A reaction time experiment showed that the ISP enhancement developed at a late stage of movement preparation just before or at movement onset. Interhemispheric inhibition of the motor-evoked potential as tested by a bifocal paired-pulse TMS protocol and thought to be mediated via a neuronal circuit different to the ISP was not enhanced when tested under identical motor task conditions. Finally, ISP enhancement by contraction of the left FDI correlated inversely with EMG mirror activity in the right FDI during phasic abductions of the left index finger. Our findings strongly suggest that voluntary M1 activation by real or imagined movement of the contralateral hand increases interhemispheric motor inhibition of the opposite M1.

Here, we implemented a standardized, data-driven procedure to characterize the electrical response of the cerebral cortex to TMS by means of three synthetic indices: significant current density (SCD), phase-locking (PL) and significant current scattering (SCS). SCD sums up the amplitude of all significant currents induced by TMS, PL reflects the ability of TMS to reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations, while SCS measures the average distance of significantly activated sources from the site of stimulation. These indices are aimed at capturing different aspects of brain responsiveness, ranging from global cortical excitability towards global cortical connectivity. We analyzed the EEG responses to TMS of Brodmann's area 19 at increasing intensities in five healthy subjects. The spatial distribution and time course of SCD, PL and SCS revealed a reproducible profile of excitability and connectivity, characterized by a local activation threshold around a TMS-induced electric field of 50 V/m and by a selective propagation of TMS-evoked activation from occipital to ipsilateral frontal areas that reached a maximum at 70-100 ms.

However, lamotrigine does not seem to modulate any of these targets, which is intriguing given that its profile in the clinic differs from that of valproic acid or lithium, with greater efficacy to prevent episodes of depression than mania. The primary target of lamotrigine is the voltage-gated sodium channel, but it is unclear why inhibition of these channels might confer antidepressant efficacy. In healthy volunteers, we found that lamotrigine had a facilitatory effect on the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) response to TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) of the prefrontal cortex. This effect was in contrast with an inhibitory effect of lamotrigine when TMS was applied over the motor cortex. In a follow-up study, a similar prefrontal specific facilitatory effect was observed in a larger cohort of healthy subjects, whereas valproic acid inhibited motor and prefrontal cortical TMS-induced BOLD response. In vitro, we found that lamotrigine (3-10 microM) enhanced the power of gamma frequency network oscillations induced by kainic acid in the rat hippocampus, an effect that was not observed with valproic acid (100 microM).

Here we aimed at gaining more insight into the underlying physiology by studying the interactions between short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). SICI and SAI were examined in a slightly contracting hand muscle of healthy subjects by measuring inhibition of a test motor-evoked potential conditioned by a sub-threshold motor cortical magnetic pulse (S1) or an electrical pulse (P) applied to the ulnar nerve at the wrist, respectively. SICI alone and SAI alone had similar magnitude when S1 intensity was set to 90% active motor threshold and P intensity to three times the perceptual sensory threshold. SICI was reduced or even disinhibited when P was co-applied, and SAI was reduced or disinhibited when S1 was co-applied. These interactions did not depend on the exact timing of arrival of P and S1 in motor cortex. A control experiment with a S1 intensity lowered to 70% active motor threshold excluded a contribution by short-interval intracortical facilitation. Finally, SICI with co-applied P correlated linearly with SICI alone with a slope of the regression line close to 1 whereas SAI did not correlate with SAI when S1 was co-applied with a slope of the regression line close to zero. Data indicate that S1 largely eliminates the effects of P when applied together, suggesting dominance of S1 over P. Findings strongly support the idea that SICI and SAI are mediated through two distinct and reciprocally connected subtypes of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons with convergent projections onto the corticospinal neurons. Furthermore, dominance of S1 over P is compatible with the notion that the SICI interneurons target the corticospinal neurons closer to their axon initial segment than the SAI interneurons.", "pages": "1434-8"}, {"volume": "587", "title": "Primary motor cortical metaplasticity induced by priming over the supplementary motor area.", "issue": "Pt 20", "pmid": "18187362", "authors": ["Hamada, M", "Hanajima, R", "Terao, Y", "Okabe, S", "Nakatani-Enomoto, S", "Furubayashi, T", "Matsumoto, H", "Shirota, Y", "Ohminami, S", "Ugawa, Y"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is emerging as a therapeutic tool for patients with intractable epilepsy.

Movements of the left arm were slow and parkinsonian whereas movement speed and simple reaction times (RT) of the right (operated) arm were within the normal range with no obvious deficits in a range of daily life activities.

These deficits are best explained by a failure of the cortex, deprived of BG input, to facilitate responses in a probabilistic context.

We have previously demonstrated occipital cortex hyperexcitability in migraine using an objective technique of magnetic suppression of perceptual accuracy (MSPA). We hypothesized that a neuromodulator such as topiramate would demonstrate differences in MSPA in migraine compared with baseline. Ten migraine patients were recruited. To assess inhibitory function MSPA was measured using the following protocol. Timed transcranial magnetic stimulation were delivered at interstimulus intervals (ISI) varying from 40 to 190 ms (eight stimulations at each ISI) at 60% stimulus intensity. Subjects were asked to report letters projected at a fixed luminance on the screen. Visual suppression was calculated based on the number of errors the subjects made using automated analysis. This procedure was repeated at a minimum of two different dosages of topiramate when it was titrated for optimal migraine control. The interim dose was that at which an improvement in headache frequency was first observed, and the optimal dose was that at which the patient had a \u2265 50% reduction in headache frequency, or had reached a 100-mg dose. The mean [standard error (s.e.)] level of letters reported correct at baseline at 100-ms ISI was 91.6 (3.4) compared with 48.5 (6.0) (P = 0.001) at an optimal dose of topiramate. Dose ranged from 50 to 100 mg; the average dose was 75 mg. The interim dose for most patients was 50 mg; the mean (s.e.) percentage of letters reported correct at interim was 75.9 (6.2) compared with baseline (P = 0.01). Mean number of headaches at baseline was 27 per month, compared with eight headaches per month at interim dose and four headaches per month at optimal dose. There was no significant correlation between mean change in frequency of headache and mean change in inhibition from baseline to optimal dose (0.04, P = 0.89). Topiramate modulates occipital cortex excitability in chronic migraine possibly via mechanisms of cortical inhibition. Since there was not a strong correlation between the degree of inhibition and reduction of migraine frequency, it would appear that topiramate did have an independent effect on cortical excitability that was not dependent on reduction in migraine frequency.", "pages": "1434-8"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Selective increase in corticospinal excitability in the context of tactile exploration.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7705502", "authors": ["Cho, SS", "Strafella, AP"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Somatosensory & motor research", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve stimulation inhibits the motor cortex and the process has been termed afferent inhibition.

We hypothesized that the left M1(HAND) would integrate LTP- and LTD-like plasticity in a homeostatic fashion. In ten healthy volunteers, low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMD) was first applied to produce an LTP-like increase (5 Hz rTMS) or LTD-like decrease (1 Hz rTMS) in corticospinal excitability in left M1(HAND) via premotor-to-motor inputs.

Since the supplementary motor area (SMA) has anatomical and functional cortico-cortical connections with M1, here we studied the homeostatic effects of priming stimulation over the SMA on subsequent rTMS-induced plasticity of M1. For priming and subsequent conditioning, we employed a new rTMS protocol, quadripulse stimulation (QPS), which produces a broad range of motor cortical plasticity depending on the interval of the pulses within a burst. The plastic changes induced by QPS at various intervals were altered by priming stimulation over the SMA, which did not change motor-evoked potential sizes on its own but specifically modulated the excitatory I-wave circuits.

Reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] in ALS, a feature linked to the development of cortical hyperexcitability, may be mediated by degeneration of inhibitory circuits or alternatively activation of high threshold excitatory circuits. As such, determining the mechanisms of SICI reduction in ALS has clear diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Consequently, the present study utilized a novel threshold tracking paired-pulse paradigm to determine whether SICI reduction in ALS represented reduced inhibition or excessive excitation. Using a 90 mm circular coil, SICI was assessed at three different conditioning stimulus intensities: 40%, 70% and 90% of resting motor threshold [RMT]. Motor evoked potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Short interval intracortical inhibition was uniformly reduced across all three levels of conditioning intensities in ALS [40% RMT, ALS -0.6+/-0.7%, controls 2.0+/-0.6%, P<0.01; 70% RMT, ALS 0.6+/-2.7%, controls 12.8+/-2%, P<0.001; 90% RMT, ALS -15.9+/-1.3%, controls 2.2+/-4.1%, P<0.01].

P1 was a 'good responder' with improved naming and phrase length; P2 was a 'poor responder' without improved naming. Pre-TMS (10 years poststroke), P1 had significant activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex, R IFG, and in both L and R SMA during overt naming fMRI (28% pictures named). At 3 mo. post-TMS (42% named), P1 showed continued activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex, R IFG, and in R and L SMA. At 16 mo. post-TMS (58% named), he also showed significant activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex mouth and R IFG. He now showed a significant increase in activation in the L SMA compared to pre-TMS and at 3 mo. post-TMS (p < .02; p < .05, respectively). At 16 mo. there was also greater activation in L than R SMA (p < .08). At 46 mo. post-TMS (42% named), this new LH pattern of activation continued. He improved on the Boston Naming Test from 11 pictures named pre-TMS, to scores ranging from 14 to 18 pictures, post-TMS (2-43 mo. post-TMS). His longest phrase length (Cookie Theft picture) improved from three words pre-TMS, to 5-6 words post-TMS. Pre-TMS (1.5 years poststroke), P2 had significant activation in R IFG (3% pictures named). At 3 and 6 mo. post-TMS, there was no longer significant activation in R IFG, but significant activation was present in R sensorimotor cortex. On all three fMRI scans, P2 had significant activation in both the L and R SMA. There was no new, lasting perilesional LH activation across sessions for this patient. Over time, there was little or no change in his activation. His naming remained only at 1-2 pictures during all three fMRI scans. His BNT score and longest phrase length remained at one word, post-TMS. Lesion site may play a role in each patient's fMRI activation pattern and response to TMS treatment. P2, the poor responder, had an atypical frontal lesion in the L motor and premotor cortex that extended high, near brain vertex, with deep white matter lesion near L SMA. P2 also had frontal lesion in the posterior middle frontal gyrus, an area important for naming (Duffau et al., 2003); P1 did not. Additionally, P2 had lesion inferior and posterior to Wernicke's area, in parts of BA 21 and 37, whereas P1 did not. The fMRI data of our patient who had good response following TMS support the notion that restoration of the LH language network is linked in part, to better recovery of naming and phrase length in nonfluent aphasia.", "pages": "1434-8"}, {"volume": "102", "title": "Breakdown of effective connectivity during slow wave sleep: investigating the mechanism underlying a cortical gate using large-scale modeling.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10632114", "authors": ["M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen, R", "Watkins, KE"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Although the preceding chapters discuss much of the new knowledge of neurocircuitry of neuropsychiatric diseases, and an invasive approach to treatment, this chapter describes and reviews the noninvasive methods of testing circuit-based theories and treating neuropsychiatric diseases that do not involve implanting electrodes into the brain or on its surface.

Yet, there is still little knowledge on how time-varied exogenous currents acutely modulate cortical excitability. In ten healthy individuals we used on-line single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to search for systematic shifts in corticospinal excitability during anodal sleeplike 0.8-Hz slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS). In separate sessions, we repeatedly applied 30-s trials (two blocks at 20 min) of either anodal so-tDCS or constant tDCS (c-tDCS) to the primary motor hand area during quiet wakefulness. Simultaneously and time-locked to different phase angles of the slow oscillation, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as an index of corticospinal excitability were obtained in the contralateral hand muscles 10, 20, and 30 s after the onset of tDCS. MEPs were also measured off-line before, between, and after both stimulation blocks to detect any lasting excitability shifts. Both tDCS modes increased MEP amplitudes during stimulation with an attenuation of the facilitatory effect toward the end of a 30-s tDCS trial. No phase-locking of corticospinal excitability to the exogenous oscillation was observed during so-tDCS. Off-line TMS revealed that both c-tDCS and so-tDCS resulted in a lasting excitability increase. The individual magnitude of MEP facilitation during the first tDCS trials predicted the lasting MEP facilitation found after tDCS. We conclude that sleep slow oscillation-like excitability changes cannot be actively imposed on the awake cortex with so-tDCS, but phase-independent on-line as well as off-line facilitation can reliably be induced.", "pages": "1434-8"}, {"volume": "117 Suppl 1", "title": "Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults.

To try to determine the critical feature that might separate organic and psychogenic conditions, we investigated cortical plasticity in a group of 10 patients with psychogenic dystonia and compared the results with those obtained in a matched group of 10 patients with organic dystonia and 10 healthy individuals. We confirmed the presence of abnormal motor cortical inhibition (short-interval intracortical inhibition) in both organic and psychogenic groups. However, we found that plasticity (paired associative stimulation) was abnormally high only in the organic group, while there was no difference between the plasticity measured in psychogenic patients and healthy controls.

It is believed that antipsychotic drugs, especially atypical ones, could improve cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) such as mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 response are potential candidates for objective investigation of pre-attentional and attention-dependent processing in schizophrenia patients, respectively. Both these responses were found to be altered in schizophrenia. Moreover, neurotransmitters play important role in generation of MMN and P300 components. Therefore, these ERPs are potential candidates for monitoring the cognitive changes caused by neurochemical modulation during antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia patients. In addition, neurochemical ERP generation mechanisms discovered during drug-challenge studies in healthy subjects could explain these ERP findings in patients. To date, no effect of antipsychotic treatment on MMN was observed, whereas certain antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine) could modulate P300 response. At the same time, adjunctive glutamate-system affecting therapy seems to influence MMN response. The explanation of these phenomena could be a weak relationship between dopaminergic activities and MMN response and a strong connection between glutamate NMDA receptors and MMN generation. As to the P300 component, because of the multiple generators, it is more sensitive to the influences of different neurochemical activities.

We hypothesized that the repetitive pairing of TMS and interhemispheric cortico-cortical projection or paired bihemispheric stimulation (PBS), in which the right and left M1 were serially stimulated with a time interval of 15 ms, would produce an associative long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effect. In this study, 23 right-handed healthy volunteers were subjected to a 0.1 Hz repetition of 180 pairings of bihemispheric TMS, and physiological and behavioural measures of the motor system were compared before, immediately after, 20 min after and 40 min after PBS intervention. The amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) induced by the left M1 stimulation and its input-output function increased for up to approximately 20 min post-PBS. Fine finger movements were also facilitated by PBS. Spinal excitability measured by the H-reflex was insensitive to PBS, suggesting a cortical mechanism. The associative LTP-like effect induced by PBS was timing dependent, occurring only when the interstimulus interval was 5-25 ms.
