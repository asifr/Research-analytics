Specific training of deep trunk muscles and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (RPMS) improve motor control. We thus tested whether RPMS over TrA/IO combined with training could promote TrA/IO motor control and decrease pain beyond the gains already reached in CLBP. METHODS:: Thirteen CLBP patients, randomly allocated to RPMS and sham groups and compared with 9 pain-free controls, were tested in 1 session before/after (stimulation alone) and after (stimulation+TrA/IO training) combination. TrA/IO motor patterns were recorded during ballistic shoulder flexion using surface electromyography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation tested M1 excitability and short-interval intracortical inhibition. A blinded physical therapist assessed pain, disability, and kinesiophobia. RESULTS:: The missing short-interval intracortical inhibition in CLBP was restored by RPMS alone then reduced after combination of RPMS with training. This combination also normalized the (at-first delayed) anticipatory activation of iTrA/IO (ipsilateral to arm raised) and the (at-first shortened) TrA/IO coactivation duration. Sham did not influence. Pain was reduced in both groups but kinesiophobia was decreased only in RPMS 2 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS:: This study supports that peripheral neurostimulation (adjuvant to training) could improve TrA/IO motor learning and pain in CLBP associated with motor impairment. Testing of enlarged samples over several sessions should question the long-term influence of this new approach in CLBP.", "pages": "66-78"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Time-dependent effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the supramarginal gyrus.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23366649", "authors": ["Torii, T", "Sato, A", "Iwahashi, M", "Itoh, Y", "Iramina, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "It has been reported that approximately one third of patients with major depression are medication-resistant. In spite of partial responsiveness to antidepressants, most of the medication-resistant patients remain incompletely remitted without successful social reintegration. Symptom severity could be mild to moderate for many of them due to the incomplete remission, and, thus, electroconvulsive therapy is not applicable for them. However, they usually feel some difficulty performing cognitive behavioral therapy or social rehabilitation training due to residual symptoms such as thought inhibition and hypobulia. Under such conditions, those patients are longing for treatment options complementary to antidepressants, for less painful social reintegration. In October 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States finally approved repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for medication-resistant patients with major depression. The main reason for the FDA approval was that rTMS had shown similar effectiveness (effect size around 0.39 in a recent meta-analysis) to antidepressants for medication-resistant patients without serious adverse effects. TMS is a brain stimulation methodology employing magnetic energy which can penetrate the skull bone without energy decay, and, thus, eddy currents induced by TMS can stimulate cerebral cortices effectively and locally. When TMS is repetitively delivered over several hundreds of pulses within a session, stimulation effects can be observed beyond the stimulation period as aftereffects. Moreover, when a daily rTMS session is repeated over several weeks, rTMS could have antidepressant effects. Clinical trials of rTMS for depression have employed two kinds of rTMS protocol of high-frequency (facilitatory) rTMS over the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and low-frequency (inhibitory) rTMS over the right DLPFC. Although the antidepressant action of rTMS over DLPFC has not been fully elucidated, the neuronal level hypothesis includes the induction of neuroplasticity and activation of the dopamine system, and the neuronal circuitry level hypothesis includes the activation of the left DLPFC and inhibition of the right DLPFC and (para) limbic system such as the subgenual cingulate cortex and amygdala. On the therapeutic application of rTMS in clinical psychiatry, neuroethics and low invasiveness should be fully considered along with a negative history of punitive electroconvulsive therapy and prefrontal lobotomy. It is important to investigate the neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment and to place rTMS in a suitable position within comprehensive treatment algorithms of major depression.", "pages": "66-78"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation induces current pulses in transcranial direct current stimulation electrodes.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23366016", "authors": ["Peterchev, AV", "Dhamne, SC", "Kothare, R", "Rotenberg, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conventional analyses of IO data assume a sigmoidal shape with additive Gaussian scattering that allows simple regression modeling. However, careful study of the IO curve characteristics reveals that simple additive noise does not account for the observed IO variability. We propose a consistent model that adds a second source of intrinsic variability on the input side of the IO response. We develop an appropriate mathematical method for calibrating this new nonlinear model. Finally, the modeling framework is applied to a representative IO data set. With this modeling approach, previously inexplicable stochastic behavior becomes obvious.

This is despite previous in vitro studies demonstrating that the angle between the field orientation and the cell axis of symmetry has significant effects on the resulting membrane polarization presumably underlying therapeutic effects. To that end, here we examine the impact of the desired electric field orientation on the optimal placement of electrodes for a given target region. Based on high-resolution head models derived from magnetic resonance scans of patients enrolled in a clinical trial examining the use of tCS in rehabilitation after stroke, we derive and employ an optimization algorithm which computes the montage maximizing directed current flow at the target. The results reveal a strong dependence of the optimal montage on the desired orientation; moreover, the magnitude of the induced electric field at the target region varies widely with the preferred direction.

The main purpose of automating this process is to reduce the substantial effort currently required for manual segmentation, electrode placement, and solving of finite element models. In doing so, several weeks of manual labor were reduced to no more than 4 hours of computation time and minimal user interaction, while current-flow results for the automated method deviated by less than 27.9% from the manual method. Key facilitating factors are the addition of three tissue types (skull, scalp and air) to a state-of-the-art automated segmentation process, morphological processing to correct small but important segmentation errors, and automated placement of small electrodes based on easily reproducible standard electrode configurations.

We explored frontal lobe contributions to cue-induced drug craving under different intertemporal drug availability conditions by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging in smokers. We hypothesized that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regulates craving during changes in intertemporal availability. Subjective craving was greater when cigarettes were immediately available, and this effect was eliminated by transiently inactivating the DLPFC with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the signal most proportional to subjective craving was located in the medial orbitofrontal cortex across all contexts, whereas the DLPFC most strongly encoded intertemporal availability information. The craving-related signal in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was attenuated by inactivation of the DLPFC, particularly when cigarettes were immediately available. Inactivation of the DLPFC also reduced craving-related signals in the anterior cingulate and ventral striatum, areas implicated in transforming value signals into action.

To evaluate our hypothesis, we requested 16 subjects to emotionally empathise with facial stimuli and applied high frequency repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in order to induce an increased response to the facial expressions of emotion. To determine whether emotional content affects empathic behaviour, we also varied the stimulus valence (negative vs. positive vs. neutral faces). We found that autonomic (facial zygomatic and corrugator electromyography (EMG) subjective response) and detection (correct responses (CRs); response times (RTs)) measures were modulated by the MPFC activity. Specifically, when prefrontal structures were activated, subjects displayed an increased performance in CRs and reduced RTs for face recognition, as well as increased emotion-specific EMG responses in comparison to sham effects and control site stimulation. In fact, the zygomatic muscle was more responsive in cases of positive emotion (happiness), whereas corrugator activity was more robust during periods of negative emotion (fear, anger, disgust). However, an overall stronger effect was observed in response to negative, and potentially aversive, faces when compared with responses to positive and neutral faces. Finally, a direct correlation was found between the psychophysiological responses and detection measures. In summary, these results suggest that a \"simulation mechanism\" underlies emotion detection in an empathic situation that includes both EMG and behavioural responses.

Methods: 12 patients with FHD underwent five daily-sessions of 1 Hz rTMS to contralateral dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC). Patients held a pencil and made movements that did not elicit dystonic symptoms during rTMS. We hypothesized that an active but non-dystonic motor state would increase beneficial effects of rTMS.

These shifts are polarity-specific with cathodal tDCS resulting in a decrease and anodal stimulation in an increase of cortical excitability. In clinical and cognitive studies, stronger stimulation intensities are used frequently, but their physiological effects on cortical excitability have not yet been explored. Therefore, here we aimed to explore the effects of 2 mA tDCS on cortical excitability. We applied 2 mA anodal or cathodal tDCS for 20 min on the left primary motor cortex of 14 healthy subjects. Cathodal tDCS at 1 mA and sham tDCS for 20 min was administered as control session in nine and eight healthy subjects, respectively. Motor cortical excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Global corticospinal excitability was explored via single TMS pulse-elicited MEP amplitudes, and motor thresholds. Intracortical effects of stimulation were obtained by cortical silent period (CSP), short latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF), and I wave facilitation. The above-mentioned protocols were recorded both before and immediately after tDCS in randomized order. Additionally, single-pulse MEPs, motor thresholds, SICI and ICF were recorded every 30 min up to 2 h after stimulation end, evening of the same day, next morning, next noon and next evening. Anodal as well as cathodal tDCS at 2 mA resulted in a significant increase of MEP amplitudes, whereas 1 mA cathodal tDCS decreased corticospinal excitability. A significant shift of SICI and ICF towards excitability enhancement after both 2 mA cathodal and anodal tDCS was observed. At 1 mA, cathodal tDCS reduced single-pulse TMS-elicited MEP amplitudes and shifted SICI and ICF towards inhibition. No significant changes were observed in the other protocols. Sham tDCS did not induce significant MEP alterations. These results suggest that an enhancement of tDCS intensity does not necessarily increase efficacy of stimulation, but might also shift the direction of excitability alterations.

Furthermore, we show that this PFC stimulation induces a long-lasting suppression of anxiety-like behavior (but not conditioned social avoidance) in socially stressed Thy1-Chr2 mice: an effect that is observed >10 d after the last stimulation. Finally, we use optogenetic stimulation and multicircuit recording techniques concurrently in Thy1-Chr2 mice to demonstrate that activation of cortical projection neurons entrains neural oscillatory activity and drives synchrony across limbic brain areas that regulate affect. Importantly, these neural oscillatory changes directly correlate with the temporally precise activation and suppression of limbic unit activity. Together, our findings show that the direct activation of cortical projection systems is sufficient to modulate activity across networks underlying affective regulation.

In particular, short-latency potentials peaking at 5 (P5) and 8 (N8) ms after the TMS pulse have been recently described, but because of their large amplitude, the problem of whether their origin is cortical or not has been opened. To gain information about these components, we employed a protocol that modulates primary motor cortex excitability (MI): low frequency stimulation of premotor area (PMC). TMS was applied simultaneously with EEG recording from 70 electrodes. Amplitude of TEPs evoked by 200 single-pulses TMS delivered over MI at 110% of resting motor threshold (rMT) was measured before and after applying 900 TMS conditioning stimuli to left PMC with 1 Hz repetition rate. Single subject analyses showed reduction in TEPs amplitude after PMC conditioning in a sample of participants and increase in TEPs amplitude in two subjects. No effects were found on corticospinal excitability as recorded by motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Furthermore, correlation analysis showed an inverse relation between the effects of the conditioning protocol on P5-N8 complex amplitude and MEPs amplitude. Because the effects of the used protocol have been ascribed to a cortical interaction between premotor area and MI, we suggest that despite the sign of P5-N8 amplitude modulation is not consistent across participant; this modulation could indicate, at least in part, their cortical origin.

We focussed on the left supramarginalis gyrus (SMG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), whose activation, as evidenced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, suggests that they may play a critical role in tool use. The distinctive location of SMG in the dorsal visual stream led us to postulate that this parietal region could play a role in processing incoming information about tools to shape hand posture. In contrast, we hypothesized that MTG, because of its interconnections with several cortical areas involved in semantic memory, could contribute to retrieving semantic information necessary to create a contextual representation of tool use. To test these hypotheses, we used neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interfere transiently with the function of either left SMG or left MTG in healthy participants performing judgement tasks about either hand configuration or context of tool use. We found that SMG virtual lesions impaired hand configuration but not contextual judgements, whereas MTG lesions selectively interfered with judgements about the context of tool use while leaving hand configuration judgements unaffected. This double dissociation demonstrates that the ability to infer a context of use or a hand posture from tool perception relies on distinct processes, performed in the temporal and parietal regions.

OBJECTIVES: The relationship between pharmacologic background and effects of rTMS of the primary motor cortex was investigated to clarify the pharmacologic basis of rTMS-induced analgesia in poststroke pain patients. METHODS: Changes in visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain following drug challenge tests using ketamine, morphine, and thiopental were compared with the changes in VAS score following rTMS of the primary motor cortex (frequency 5\u2009Hz, at 100% resting motor threshold, 500 pulses per session) in 20 poststroke pain patients. RESULTS: In our drug challenge test, 10 of 20 (50%) patients in ketamine test, 7 of 20 (35%) in thiopental test, and 3 of 20 (15%) in morphine test showed more than 40% reduction of VAS score. VAS score decreased immediately after rTMS of motor cortex and persisted for 300\u2009min (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's multiple comparisons). Comparison of the magnitude of VAS score reduction between drug challenge test and rTMS showed significant correlations with ketamine test (r = 0.503, p = 0.012), morphine test (r = 0.526, p = 0.009), and thiopental test (r = 0.609, p = 0.002) by regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS-induced VAS score reduction correlated well with morphine, ketamine, and thiopental tests. However, ketamine sensitivity was observed in more cases compared with morphine and thiopental in poststroke pain patients.

Bidirectional and multidirectional training were associated with increases and decreases in a number of cortical motor map sites from where tongue activity could be evoked, however; multidirectional training was associated with a greater number of cortical motor map sites with increased excitability and a shift in the centre of gravity of the motor map. No effects of training were found on the FDI TMS-MEP stimulus-response curves. This study revealed distinct training-related features of tongue MI neuroplasticity and proposes that a greater amount of functionally related neuronal populations may be 'trained' by the inclusion of different and more complex directional parameters within a novel motor task.", "pages": "66-78"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Introduction.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16482475", "authors": ["Iasemidis, LD", "Schachter, S", "Fregni, F", "Ilmoniemi, R"], "year": "2013", "journal": "International journal of neural systems", "abstract": "Functional (conversion) neurological symptoms (FNS) are commonly encountered in neurological and psychiatric clinical settings and represent a considerable burden on healthcare systems. There is a conspicuous paucity of evidence-based treatments for FNS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) offers a safe, non-invasive method of probing changes in cortical excitability and/or connectivity. It has already had some success in demonstrating abnormalities of cortical excitability in patients with FNS, particularly when the functional symptom in question relates to movement. We reviewed the literature for studies in which TMS has been used in the treatment of FNS. All patients in the identified studies had motor symptoms (either weakness or movement disorder). There was considerable heterogeneity in terms of study quality, population sampled, study design, TMS parameters and outcome measures. No studies were placebo controlled. Despite the majority of studies claiming success for the technique, there is insufficient good quality evidence to establish TMS as an effective treatment modality for FNS. We outline the methodological considerations that should be taken into account in future studies of the efficacy of TMS in treating FNS and discuss mechanisms by which TMS, if efficacious, may exert a therapeutic effect, including: (a) via genuine neuromodulation, (b) via non-specific placebo effects and (c) by demonstrating, through its immediate effects on the motor system (eg, movement in a 'paretic' limb), that symptom improvement is possible, thus directly changing higher level beliefs that may be responsible for the maintenance of the disorder.", "pages": "66-78"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Global aphasia without hemiparesis: the underlying mechanism examined by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17655481", "authors": ["Shindo, A", "Satoh, M", "Naito, Y", "Asahi, M", "Takashima, S", "Sasaki, R", "Furukawa, K", "Narita, Y", "Kuzuhara, S", "Tomimoto, H"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The neurologist", "abstract": "The ability to infer deceptive intents from nonverbal behavior is critical for social interactions. By combining single-pulse and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy humans, we provide both correlational and causative evidence that action simulation is actively involved in the ability to recognize deceptive body movements. We recorded motor-evoked potentials during a faked-action discrimination (FAD) task: participants watched videos of actors lifting a cube and judged whether the actors were trying to deceive them concerning the real weight of the cube. Seeing faked actions facilitated the observers' motor system more than truthful actions in a body-part-specific manner, suggesting that motor resonance was sensitive to deceptive movements. Furthermore, we found that TMS virtual lesion to the anterior node of the action observation network, namely the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), reduced perceptual sensitivity in the FAD task. In contrast, no change in FAD task performance was found after virtual lesions to the left temporoparietal junction (control site). Moreover, virtual lesion to the IFC failed to affect performance in a difficulty-matched spatial-control task that did not require processing of spatiotemporal (acceleration) and configurational (limb displacement) features of seen actions, which are critical to detecting deceptive intent in the actions of others. These findings indicate that the human IFC is critical for recognizing deceptive body movements and suggest that FAD relies on the simulation of subtle changes in action kinematics within the motor system.", "pages": "66-78"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "The motor cortex is causally related to predictive eye movements during action observation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17805098", "authors": ["Elsner, C", "D'Ausilio, A", "Gredeb\u00e4ck, G", "Falck-Ytter, T", "Fadiga, L"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Grouping local elements into a holistic percept, also known as spatial binding, is crucial for meaningful perception. Previous studies have shown that neurons in early visual areas V1 and V2 can signal complex grouping-related information, such as illusory contours or object-border ownerships. However, relatively little is known about higher-level processes contributing to these signals and mediating global Gestalt perception. We used a novel bistable motion illusion that induced alternating and mutually exclusive vivid conscious experiences of either dynamic illusory contours forming a global Gestalt or moving ungrouped local elements while the visual stimulation remained the same. fMRI in healthy human volunteers revealed that activity fluctuations in two sites of the parietal cortex, the superior parietal lobe and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), correlated specifically with the perception of the grouped illusory Gestalt as opposed to perception of ungrouped local elements. We then disturbed activity at these two sites in the same participants using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS over aIPS led to a selective shortening of the duration of the global Gestalt percept, with no effect on that of local elements. The results suggest that aIPS activity is directly involved in the process of spatial binding during effortless viewing in the healthy brain. Conscious perception of global Gestalt is therefore associated with aIPS function, similar to attention and perceptual selection.", "pages": "66-78"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Practical assessment of preoperative functional mapping techniques: navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17964167", "authors": ["Mangraviti, A", "Casali, C", "Cordella, R", "Legnani, FG", "Mattei, L", "Prada, F", "Saladino, A", "Perin, A", "Dimeco, F"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Converging lines of evidence implicate the glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.
