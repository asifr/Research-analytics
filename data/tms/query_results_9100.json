In particular, consideration was given to the effects of unilateral handgrip of different strengths, jaw clench, and combined bilateral handgrip (Jendrassik maneuver) and jaw clench. Eight healthy adult volunteer subjects (six women, two men) participated in the main study. The clinical usefulness of this form of facilitation was subsequently demonstrated in three patients with myelopathy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex was delivered from a Cadwell MES-10 (100% intensity) with a 9.5-cm circular coil positioned with the rim over the vertex. Stimuli were delivered \u223c 1 s after initiation of reinforcement. In the main study of normal subjects, surface recordings of the evoked compound muscle action potentials were made bilaterally from anterior tibialis and lateral gastrocnemius. In the individual studies of patients, MEPs were also recorded from abductor pollicis brevis and other muscles innervated from roots below the level of lesion. The principal results showed that unilateral handgrip (50 and 100% maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) of either hand enhanced the amplitude of MEPs bilaterally in both tibialis anterior and lateral gastrocnemius in all normal subiects (p < 0.05). The mean increase in amplitude associated with 100% MVC unilateral handgrip was >300% of the control value when the subject was relaxed (p < 0.01). The bilateral Jendrassik maneuver and jaw clench were also effective in increasing (p < 0.05) MEP amplitude in both muscle groups. These two procedures did not yield the same degree of reinforcement as 100% unilateral handgrip. Remote muscle contractions induced a reduction in MEP latency of 1-2 ms (p < 0.05). The clinical importance of these observations was demonstrated by the fact that remote muscle reinforcement enabled identification of low-amplitude MEPs that might otherwise have been missed in the three patients with spinal cord trauma.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "The effect of neuroleptanalgesia (droperiodol-fentanyl) on motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the monkey.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "20870499", "authors": ["Ghaly, RF", "Stone, JL", "Levy, WJ", "Kartha, R", "Brunner, EA", "Aldrete, JA", "Laege, R"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been examined in 12 monkeys under neuroleptanalgesia (NLA).

A method of monitoring that allows direct and continuous assessment of motor function within the central nervous system during surgery would be useful. This paper describes one such method utilizing noninvasive electric cortical stimulation to evoke muscle activity (the motor evoked potential, or MEP) during surgery. The effect of isoflurane (superimposed on a baseline of N2O/narcotic anesthesia) on MEP's in response to cortical stimulation is specifically examined. Eight patients undergoing elective neurosurgical operations were included in the study. All patients received a background of general anesthesia and partial nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The motor cortex was stimulated electrically via self-adhesive scalp electrodes. Electromyographic responses from multiple muscles were measured with subdermal electroencephalograph-type needle electrodes. Motor responses to stimulation were continually recorded on magnetic tape for off-line analysis. Once closing of the surgical incision was begun, a series of four to five stimuli of constant magnitude were applied to obtain \"baseline\" MEP responses. Patients were then ventilated with isoflurane for up to 8 minutes, during which time stimuli were continued every 15 to 20 seconds. Comparison was made of MEP responses for trials before, 1 minute after, and 5 minutes after the addition of isoflurane. All patients demonstrated reproducible motor responses to cortical stimulation during surgery. Addition of isoflurane [isoflurane)exp, less than or equal to 0.5%) to pre-existing anesthesia caused marked attenuation of MEP amplitudes in all patients within 5 minutes of its application, without affecting neuromuscular transmission as judged by direct peripheral nerve stimulation. It is concluded that: 1) monitoring motor system integrity and function with electric transcranial cortical stimulation during surgery is feasible when utilizing an N2O/narcotic anesthetic protocol; and 2) the quality of data obtained will likely suffer with the addition of isoflurane.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Motor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "2033449", "authors": ["Fries, W", "Danek, A", "Witt, TN"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Motor responses were evoked in the thenar muscles by transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in 5 stroke patients with an isolated lacuna in the internal capsule, in whom wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract was demonstrated in vivo.

The effect of muscle stretch on the EMG response from the stretched muscle to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex was studied in eight subjects. Muscle stretch was produced by increasing the torque of a motor acting through a lever which was held at constant position by a flexion force of the index and middle fingers. EMG responses were recorded from fine-wire electrodes inserted into flexor digitorum profundus muscle in the forearm. They consisted of a spinal latency component and a long-latency component which could in some subjects be separated into an early and a late phase. 2. In four subjects, four intervals between the stretch and the cortical stimulus were explored using three intensities of cortical stimulation. At all three intensities, when the magnetic cortical stimulus was timed to produce an EMG response in the period of the later part of the long-latency stretch reflex the response was larger than when it was timed to produce a response in the period of the short-latency spinal reflex or when superimposed on the tonic muscle activity used to resist the standing torque of the motor. 3. When the intensity of magnetic cortical stimulation was reduced so that it was just below threshold to produce an EMG response in the short-latency reflex period or on the background tonic EMG activity, it still was capable of producing a response when superimposed on the long-latency stretch reflex. 4. In four subjects the time course of this effect was studied in more detail using only one intensity of magnetic cortical stimulus set to be just above threshold to produce a response in tonically active muscles. The time course of the facilitatory effect was similar to the time course of the later part of the long-latency stretch reflex. From these data it was not possible to determine whether the early part of the long-latency stretch reflex also was accompanied by the facilitatory effect since this component was present in only one of the four subjects. 5. The facilitatory effect persisted after the ulnar and median nerves were totally blocked at the wrist by injections of local anaesthetic. This suggests that inputs from muscle receptors of the stretched muscle contribute to the effect.4=", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "114 ( Pt 1B)", "title": "Congenital mirror movements.

The results of this study demonstrate a significant influence of posture upon the amplitudes of CMAPs. Postural facilitation presented itself, firstly, in terms of a higher incidence of bilateral activation of distal leg muscles during stance and, secondly, as significant enhancement of the amplitude of CMAPs while standing as compared to lying supine. The onset latency, however, did not disclose a significant shortening during stance. To assess the effects of preinnervation subjects voluntarily adjusted the level of TA activity to 5%, 10% and 20% of maximum isometric force respectively before cortex stimulation. Voluntary background contraction resulted in a significant increase of amplitude of CMAPs but, in contrast to postural facilitation, concomitant with a significant decrease in onset latency.

In normal subjects, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand region of the motor cortex evokes motor responses only in contralateral hand muscles at a latency of about 19-24 ms. In contrast, stimulation of the motor cortex of three mirror movement subjects evoked, nearly simultaneously, motor responses in hand muscles on both sides of the body at latencies similar to those of normal subjects. In these subjects no other neuroanatomical pathways appear to be abnormally directed across the mid-line. Thus, their mirror movements are probably due to a projection of the corticospinal tract to homologous motoneurone pools on each side of the body. 2. We reasoned that if the motor cortex contributes to the generation of long-latency stretch reflex responses then in these mirror movement subjects stretching a muscle on one side of the body should produce long-latency reflex responses in the ipsilateral and the homologous contralateral muscle. 3. To test this idea experiments were done on normal human subjects and on the subjects with mirror movements. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the flexor pollicis longus muscle (FPL) on each side of the body was recorded. Stretch of the distal phalanx of the thumb of one hand produced a series of distinct reflex EMG responses in the ipsilateral FPL. The earliest response, when present, began at 25 ms (S.D. = 3.5 ms) and was followed by responses at 40 (S.D. = 3.9 ms) and 56 ms (S.D. = 4.3 ms). There was no difference, either in timing or intensity, between the ipsilateral FPL EMG responses of normal subjects and those of the mirror movement subjects. 4. No response of any kind was observed in the contralateral (unstretched) FPL of normal subjects. In contrast, we observed in all three mirror movement subjects EMG responses in the contralateral (unstretched) FPL beginning at 45-50 ms. The latency of this response is considerably shorter than the fastest voluntary kinaesthetic reaction time, which was on average 130 ms (S.D. = 11 ms). The contralateral long-latency EMG response observed in the mirror movement subjects was on average 30% (range 5-60%) of that on the ipsilateral side. No short-latency response (25 ms) was ever observed in the contralateral FPL of these subjects. 5.

The principal methods of reinforcement included target and remote muscle contractions and conditioning of MEPs with a brief (20 msec) train of cutaneous stimulation (500 Hz: duration 0.1 msec) delivered 20-150 msec prior to cortical stimulation. Twelve control subjects and 26 patients with severe traumatic spinal cord injury underwent cortical stimulation delivered from a Cadwell MES-10 (70-100% intensity) through a 9-cm focal-point coil. Electromyographic responses were recorded from surface electrodes in bipolar configuration and amplified (3 dB down at 10 Hz-1 kHz) prior to storage. MEPs were recorded, following reinforcement, in muscles with clinically complete paralysis in 4/26 patients. In each case, MEPs were of low amplitude (less than 0.5 mV), polyphasic, and with variable and prolonged latencies. MEPs were evoked in severely paretic (clinically incomplete paralysis) muscles in 6/8 patients only when neurological reinforcement was employed. Conditioning of MEPs in tibialis anterior with preceding cutaneous stimulation to the plantar surface (subthreshold for evoking a flexion reflex) yielded a well-defined modulation of MEP amplitude in control subjects. An early (Conditioning-Test (C-T) intervals 20-45 msec) period of inhibition of MEPs (mean = 60% of control) was followed by a period (C-T intervals 50-90 msec) of facilitation (mean = 345%) and a subsequent (C-T intervals 90-150 msec) period of inhibition (mean = 0%). In spinal cord injured patients the same conditioning paradigm failed to reveal MEPs, but did result in the appearance of suprathreshold flexion reflexes in 2 patients at 20-55 msec C-T intervals. This summation of convergent but subliminal cortical and cutaneous inputs to the target motoneuron pool provided additional evidence of preserved cortical influence on segmental structures that was not detectable by other means. These results extend previous reports of electrophysiological evidence of spared motor pathways in spinal cord injured patients with complete paralysis, and affirm the need for neurological reinforcement as a routine procedure in cortical stimulation studies of spinal cord injuries.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Magnetic stimulation of corticonuclear systems and of cranial nerves in man: physiological basis and clinical application.", "issue": "", "pmid": "15815379", "authors": ["Benecke, R", "Meyer, BU"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology. Supplement", "abstract": "It is suggested that transcranial electric stimulation can activate pyramidal tract projections both directly and indirectly in a manner similar to that described after direct stimulation of the exposed cortex in the monkey. This produces both D- and I-waves in the pyramidal tract. At high intensities of stimulation, the stimulus can spread into the brain and activate pyramidal tract axons several centimeters below the cortical surface. Magnetic stimulation at moderate intensities produces electromyographic (EMG) responses with latencies 1-2 msec longer than those after electric stimulation. Two possible explanations have been put forward to account for this effect: (1) because of the difference in the direction of electric current flow induced in the brain by the 2 forms of stimulation, magnetic stimulation preferentially excites pyramidal tract cells indirectly, and hence evokes only I-waves in the pyramidal tract. (2) Electric stimulation (even at threshold) activates pyramidal axons deep in the white matter, whereas magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal cells in the gray matter, probably at their initial segment. There is one interesting consequence common to both explanations. Whether magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically or at their initial segment, the size of the descending volley evoked will depend on the level of excitability of the motor cortex. In contrast, the response to electric stimulation will be less affected, since a proportion of the descending volley is initiated directly at the axon of the pyramidal cell. This differential effect of cortical excitability on the responses to electrical and magnetic stimulation can be useful in describing excitatory or inhibitory influences on motor cortex from other structures.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Reinforcement of motor evoked potentials in patients with spinal cord injury.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1864246", "authors": ["Hayes, KC", "Allatt, RD", "Wolfe, DL", "Kasai, T", "Hsieh, J"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology.

Amplitudes and latencies of CMAPs were compared with those obtained by CortStim alone. When applying short trains of 10 msec duration, of 300/sec-400/sec TSF, and of threshold or supramaximal intensity for motor fibers, both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on the responses to CortStim were achieved depending on the timing of the train onset. With a TO of 8-10 msec before CortStim, mean amplitudes of CMAPs were enhanced 3-10 times; mean amplitudes reached up to 20 times the baseline values when the TO was greater than 45 msec before CortStim. With a TO of 15-35 msec before CortStim, amplitudes were diminished below control values. No systematic changes in latency were noted with TO of 8-10 msec, but when the TO was 45-60 msec before CortStim the latencies of CMAPs were 1.5-3 msec shorter than baseline latencies. With afferent stimuli that were subthreshold for motor fibers facilitation only occurred when the TO was about 45 msec before CortStim.

Following electrical stimulation, the descending volley consisted of an early wave which appeared at low stimulation intensity and increased in amplitude and decreased in latency when the strength of the stimulus was increased. At high stimulation intensities the early wave was followed by later waves which travel at the same speed as the initial wave. By delivering paired cortical stimuli, the early wave evoked by the test stimuli is present at 1-msec interval and progressively recovered with longer intervals. The recovery cycle of the later waves is also extremely short. Following magnetic stimulation, the descending volley also consisted of an initial wave followed by later waves.

For example, coil currents passing over the lateral part of the precentral gyrus from the front and transversely to the central sulcus elicited maximal responses in hand muscles. With the currents passing over the same area in the opposite direction, response amplitudes were much smaller, suggesting activation of different inputs to cortical motoneurons. Phosphenes.

The mean firing level in the 250 msec before the stimulus, was used to define 2 peaks of increased firing after the stimulus. The first, termed the primary peak (PP), was always present, had an onset latency in first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of 20-31 msec and was short in duration (mean 4.9 msec). A second increase in firing probability, the secondary peak (SP), was present in about half the FDI MUs studied, had a mean peak latency of 81.5 msec and had a duration up to about 40 msec. PP often consisted of a number of sub-peaks with intermodal intervals of around 1.5 msec. It is believed that PP is the result of activation of corticospinal (CS) fibres making monosynaptic connections and that sub-peaks within PP are due to the arrival at the motoneuron of successive CS impulses produced by the stimulus. SP is probably due to operation of other excitatory inputs to the motoneuron. In patients, a number of different abnormalities have been identified.

The extent of impairment was related to TMS intensity. The latency of perceptual impairment was shorter for more intense TMS. No perceptual impairment was obtained by \"sham\" stimulation when TMS shocks were applied to the upper cervical region rather than the occipital region to rule out unspecific startle reactions affecting attention possibly responsible for the observed reduction in performance. Occipital TMS did not evoke systematic eye movements except for blink responses at latencies beyond 40 ms which were too late to interfere with visual input. Depending on the required serial order of readout of the trigram perceptual impairment was more marked for the second and third part of the trigram. This demonstrates that TMS interferes with the internal serial processing of visual input. To elucidate this further, TMS was used in a Sternberg short term visual memory scanning task.

A large 12 cm (outer diameter) stimulation coil could be used for selective stimulation when a) the magnetic field radiated over the non-stimulated hemisphere is modified by using a prototype coil shield covering the half of the coil over the nonstimulated hemisphere in combination with b) placing the coil away from the midline towards the preferentially excited hemisphere.

In summary transcranial magnetic stimulation is able to activate the epileptic focus (or foci) and consequently may be an additional tool for the localization of epileptic foci in presurgical evaluation.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "335", "title": "Safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "8687", "pmid": "6737294", "authors": ["Kandler, R"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Lancet", "abstract": "The electromyographic responses of the masseter after different types of transcranial stimulation were recorded with surface and needle electrodes.

The ipsilateral responses to the same stimuli and to more lateral ones had shorter latencies and were ascribed to direct stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, probably its intracisternal portion.

An integral uptake technique was used to asses the blood-brain barrier permeability to the tracers [3H]sucrose, [14C]urea, and 36Cl-. From the arterial plasma concentration-time curve-integral the permeability surface-area products were calculated. A Dantec magnetic stimulator delivering a peak magnetic field of 1.9 T with a rise-time of 160 microseconds was used for transcranial stimulation of the rats. One group of rats had about 50-60 stimulations during the 15-min infusion of the tracers while another group was exposed to 50 magnetic stimulations a day for one week. A third group comprised the controls. No differences in permeability surface-area product were found for any of the three tracers in the rats exposed to magnetic stimulation as compared with the controls.

The response of the diaphragm to both transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical phrenic nerve stimulation was studied in thirteen normal subjects under conditions of either a 'reflex' drive to ventilation with inhaled CO2 or during volitional ventilation of similar magnitude. 2. The induced compound action potential in the diaphragm was recorded using an oesophageal electrode, and in some cases transdiaphragmatic pressure was recorded using oesophageal and gastric balloon catheters. 3. The response of the diaphragm to transcranial magnetic stimulation was invariably facilitated with volitional inspiration; there was either minimal or no response at functional residual capacity. 4. Facilitation with inspiration was also seen during a 'reflex' drive to ventilation with inhaled CO2 in the presumed absence of any volitional contribution to ventilation. A similar degree of facilitation was seen with voluntary ventilation of similar magnitude and pattern. 5. If the facilitation is predominantly a cortical phenomenon, then these results imply that there is a behavioural component in the previously supposed purely 'reflex' drive to ventilation with inhaled CO2.

Both electrical (with the anode overlying the face area of the motor cortex) and magnetic TCS (with the coil at the vertex) excite the upper motoneurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus, evoking motor potentials (C-MEPs) in the jaw-closing and suprahyoid muscles, but only during voluntary contraction. At least 30% of jaw-closing motoneurons are reached by direct fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are mainly crossed. Suprahyoid motoneurons are also reached by fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are probably bilateral. In the masseter, electrical TCS also evokes an ipsilateral motor response (R-MEP), followed by a later wave (U), and bilateral inhibitory periods. The R-MEP is secondary to excitation of the motor trigeminal root; the U wave probably results from the simultaneous excitation of Ia afferents in the root and ipsilaterally projecting corticofugal fibres; the inhibitory periods are largely due to activation of exteroceptive afferents in the root. Magnetic TCS, avoiding spread of current to the trigeminal root, evokes C-MEPs but not R-MEPs or U waves. The masseter inhibitory period after magnetic TCS may be due to excitation of corticofugal inhibitory fibres and to mechanical activation of Golgi tendon organs.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Activation of the epileptic focus by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human brain.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "6827293", "authors": ["Hufnagel, A", "Elger, CE", "Durwen, HF", "B\u00f6ker, DK", "Entzian, W"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "A refined technique is described for non invasive examination of the facial motor pathways by stimulation of the extra- and intracranial segment of the facial nerve and the facial motor cortex. Surface recordings from the nasalis muscle rather than from the orbicularis oris muscle were used, since the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from this muscle showed a more clearly defined onset. Electrical extracranial stimulation of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid fossa in 14 healthy subjects yielded a mean distal motor latency of 3.7 ms (SD 0.46), comparable with reported latencies to the orbicularis oris muscle. Using a magnetic stimulator, transcranial stimulation of the facial nerve was performed. The mechanism of transcranial magnetic facial nerve stimulation was studied using recordings on 12 patients who had facial nerve lesions at different locations, and with intraoperative direct measurements in four patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery. The actual site of stimulation could be localised to the proximal part of the facial canal, and a mean \"transosseal conduction time\" of 1.2 ms (SD 0.18) was calculated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) played an important role in mediating the magnetically induced stimulating currents. Finally, with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial motor cortex, clearly discernible CMAPs could be produced when voluntary activation of several facial muscles was used to facilitate the responses. From this, a central motor conduction time of 5.1 ms was calculated (SD 0.60, 6 subjects).", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Motor-evoked potentials in masseter muscle by electrical and magnetic stimulation in intact alert man.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "4389426", "authors": ["Macaluso, GM", "Pavesi, G", "Bonanini, M", "Mancia, D", "Gennari, PU"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Archives of oral biology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex can evoke motor responses in small hand muscles. This response can be facilitated by a background muscle contraction of the target muscle, resulting in an enhanced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) with a shorter onset latency. A number of intracortical mechanisms may account for this facilitatory effect, including, in part, direct input from visual to motor cortex. We studied the facilitation produced by a visual-motor task and compared those results with the facilitation produced by the same task without the visual cues. No differences in facilitation of amplitude or latency were observed. This suggests that there is no direct influence exerted by the visual cortex upon those elements of the motor cortex activated by a tangential magnetic stimulus, i.e., corticocortical and corticospinal neurons and their processes. Also, the large majority of facilitation (90%) was produced by a very small background voluntary contraction (less than 5% of maximum), indicating that any mild-to-moderate contraction of the target muscles will produce a consistent response for clinical measurements.", "pages": "1067-71"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "No effect of pulsed magnetic stimulation on the blood-brain barrier in rats.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "133238", "authors": ["Ravnborg, M", "Knudsen, GM", "Blinkenberg, M"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Thirty-four patients with atlanto-axial instability due to rheumatoid arthritis were examined with plain x-ray views and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MR), and were neurologically evaluated.
