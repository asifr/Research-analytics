TMS combined with electromyography (EMG) has revealed that drugs blocking Na(+) or Ca(2+) channels such as phenytoin, lamotrigin or carbamazepine change the motor threshold without affecting intracortical inhibition or facilitation. Gabaergic agents vigabatrin, lorazepam, diazepam, baclofen and ethanol do not affect the motor threshold, but increase intracortical inhibition and decrease facilitation. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists riluzole, dextromethorphan and memantine have similar effects. Dopamine receptor antagonists such as haloperidol, but not sulpiride, decrease intracortical inhibition and increase intracortical facilitation. Other monoamines, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, may have some modulating effect on the cortical excitability. However, TMS combined with EMG gives only indirect evidence about the excitability of the motor cortex because spinal mechanisms may contribute to the results. Cortical excitability can be studied directly by combining TMS with brain imaging methods such as electroencephalography (EEG). Motor and non-motor areas can be stimulated and subsequent brain activity can be measured. Ethanol has been shown to modulate EEG responses evoked by motor-cortex TMS, the effects being largest at the right prefrontal cortex, meaning that ethanol would have changed the functional connectivity. Furthermore, alcohol decreases amplitudes of EEG responses after the left prefrontal stimulation mainly in anterior parts of the cortex, which may be associated with the decrease of the prefrontal cortical excitability.

Strong evidence implicates intracortical mechanisms in this depression. As well as evoking MEPs in contralateral muscles, TMS also reduces MEPs evoked in ipsilateral muscles through interhemispheric inhibition mediated by a transcallosal pathway. Here we have sought to determine whether this effect is also depressed after exercise. Using two magnetic stimulators, the aftereffects of unilateral hand muscle exercise on the ability of TMS delivered to the hemisphere that generated the exercise were examined to i) generate MEPs in the exercised hand muscles, and ii) depress MEPs evoked by TMS pulses in contralateral (non-exercised) hand muscles. After exercise there was a significant reduction in the amplitudes of MEPs evoked by TMS in the exercised muscles ( p<0.001). However, the same stimuli remained able to depress responses evoked by TMS to the contralateral hemisphere in the non-exercised muscles as effectively as before the exercise. We conclude that unlike the MEPs evoked by corticospinal output, interhemispheric inhibition evoked from the hemisphere that generated the exercise is not depressed after exercise. A similar differential effect on interhemispheric inhibition and corticospinal output has been reported recently for the effects of transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation of the motor cortex.

Intensive use of a particular part of the body can also induce reorganization of neural circuits (use-dependent plasticity) in the central nervous system (CNS). What happens in the CNS when the nerve stimulation is applied in concert with the use of particular muscle groups? The purpose of this study was to investigate short-term effects of electrical stimulation of the common peroneal (CP) nerve during walking on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the ankle flexors and extensors in healthy subjects. Since the stimulation was applied during the swing phase of the step cycle when the ankle flexors are active, this is referred to as functional electrical stimulation (FES). The following questions were addressed: (1) can FES during walking increase corticospinal excitability more effectively than passively received repetitive nerve stimulation and (2) does walking itself improve the descending connection. FES was delivered using a foot drop stimulator that activates ankle dorsiflexors during the swing phase of the step cycle. MEPs in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus muscles were measured before, between, and after periods of walking with or without FES, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. After 30 min of walking with FES, the half-maximum peak-to-peak MEP (MEP(h)) in the TA increased in amplitude and this facilitatory effect lasted for at least 30 min. In contrast, walking had no effects on the TA MEP(h) without FES. The increase in the TA MEP(h) with FES (approximately 40%) was similar to that with repetitive CP nerve stimulation at rest. The soleus MEP(h) was also increased after walking with FES, but not without FES, which differs from the previous observation with CP nerve stimulation at rest. With FES, the TA silent period at MEP(h) was unchanged or slightly decreased, while it increased after walking without FES. Increased cortical excitability accompanied by unchanged cortical inhibition (no changes in the silent period with FES) suggests that FES did not simply increase general excitability of the cortex, but had specific effects on particular cortical neurons.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "Effects of vagus nerve stimulation on cortical excitability in epileptic patients.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "10835434", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Oliviero, A", "Pilato, F", "Saturno, E", "Dileone, M", "Meglio, M", "Colicchio, G", "Barba, C", "Papacci, F", "Tonali, PA"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) recently has been assessed as a noninvasive treatment modality for movement and psychiatric disorders, whereas the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects is not fully understood.

Based on these results, we conclude that at around 150-ms intervals, TMS over the motor areas (M1 and vPM) reduces the excitability of the contralateral motor area.

Increasing evidence suggests that the CMS is crucially important for skilled individuated finger movements. Little is known about to what extent the strength of the CMS differs between hand muscles. Here we measured CMS excitation to the first dorsal interosseus (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in healthy subjects by using a novel penta-stimulation technique (PST) and single motor unit (SMU) recordings. The PST is an extension of the triple-stimulation technique. It applies two additional supramaximal electrical stimuli at the wrist to the 'peripheral nerve of no interest' (in the case of the FDI and ADM the median nerve, in the case of the APB the ulnar nerve) to collide with the descending volleys in that nerve elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex and electrical stimulation of Erb's point. This eliminates volume conduction from neighbouring muscles innervated by the nerve of no interest and, therefore, allows accurate determination of the PST response. The PST response was significantly larger in the FDI compared with the ADM and APB. This was validated by the SMU recordings, which showed a higher estimated amplitude of the mean compound excitatory postsynaptic potential in spinal motoneurons of the FDI than in those of the APB and ADM. Finally, as a possible functional correlate, the maximum rate of repetitive voluntary finger movements was higher for index finger abduction (prime mover, FDI) than for little finger abduction (prime mover, ADM) and thumb abduction (prime mover, APB), and individual differences in maximum rate between the different movements correlated with individual differences in the corresponding PST responses. In conclusion, PST is a valuable novel method for accurate quantification of CMS excitation. The findings strongly suggest that CMS excitation differs between hand muscles and that these differences directly link to capability differences in individuated finger movements.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Evaluation of an image-guided, robotically positioned transcranial magnetic stimulation system.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11352620", "authors": ["Lancaster, JL", "Narayana, S", "Wenzel, D", "Luckemeyer, J", "Roby, J", "Fox, P"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "The authors examined serial changes in optical topography in a stroke patient performing a functional task, as well as clinical and physiologic measures while undergoing constraint-induced therapy (CIT).

Processing of auditory information in the OC has previously been shown to exist only in blind persons. Thus, the latter finding provides the first evidence of an involvement of the visual cortex in spatial hearing in sighted human subjects, and suggests a close interconnection of the neural representation of auditory and visual space. Because rTMS induced systematic shifts in auditory lateralization, but not a general deterioration, we propose that rTMS of STG or OC specifically affected neuronal circuits transforming auditory spatial coordinates in order to maintain alignment with vision.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "1011", "title": "Effects of gonadal steroids on the input-output relationship of the corticospinal pathway in humans.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9696052", "authors": ["Bonifazi, M", "Ginanneschi, F", "della Volpe, R", "Rossi, A"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "D-Cycloserine (CYC), a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist, has been shown to improve cognitive functions in humans.

This is, however, an important question, which bears on the cortical versus peripheral-segmental 'interest' in controlling alpha-MN excitation. Alpha-MN excitation can be quantified by estimating the amplitude of alpha-MN compound excitatory post-synaptic potentials (cEPSPs) from single motor unit (SMU) recordings, if certain assumptions about the membrane trajectory are made [Exp. Brain Res. 47 (1982) 33]. Here we recorded 29 SMUs from three different hand muscles (FDI, first dorsal interosseous; ADM, abductor digiti minimi; APB, abductor pollicis brevis) of healthy subjects. Each SMU was tested for CM input by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex, for Ia afferent input by electrical peripheral nerve stimulation, and for the interaction between inputs by paired stimulation timed to arrive coincidently at the alpha-MN. Mean cEPSP amplitude elicited by CM input was larger in the alpha-MNs of the FDI than in those of the ADM or APB, whereas mean cEPSP amplitude elicited by Ia input was larger in the alpha-MNs of the APB than in those of the FDI. Generally, cEPSP amplitude evoked by paired input closely matched the arithmetic sum of the cEPSP amplitudes evoked by the single inputs. In conclusion, alpha-MNs of the human hand can be viewed as linear integrators of CM and Ia excitatory inputs.

We obtained measures of motor threshold (MT), motor-evoked potentials (MEP) from the contralateral flexor digitorium superficialis, and TMS-induced forces from individual fingers. Increased MEP and decreased MT during motor imagery tasks suggested enhanced excitability of structures involved in the generation of TMS-induced responses. TMS-induced forces were larger during motor imagery tasks than at rest. This effect was present, albeit significantly smaller, in the middle, ring, and little fingers during ImIn as compared to ImAll. This finding has been interpreted as a correlate of the phenomenon of unintended finger force production (enslaving). The motor imagery effect on finger forces evoked by TMS was significantly larger during ImIn (4% MVC) than during ImAll (2.8% MVC) tasks, corresponding to the phenomenon of force deficit.

We found that in all subjects, the time course of MEP changes during relaxation was closely fitted by a Boltzmann sigmoidal curve which allowed us to estimate the mean MEP amplitudes as well as the ratio of the amplitudes after single or pairs of TMS pulses (i.e.%SICI) at any time in the task. The data showed that the amplitude of MEPs to single pulse TMS had started to decline at about the same time as the onset of EMG silence.

When the muscle was modestly contracted, the first of these responses disappeared, whereas the second response was facilitated. Both fast and slow components of the corticospinal tract were usually intact and excited by TMS in these patients. We propose that there is an abnormality of intracortical or intraspinal inhibition in a subgroup of D90A SOD1 ALS patients, which suppresses fast-conducted activity when the muscle is active. Apart from further defining the phenotype of familial ALS, these findings may have importance in understanding the pathogenesis of central motor abnormalities in these patients.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "161", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation and processing of facial threats.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "8725963", "authors": ["van Honk, J", "Schutter, DJ"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The American journal of psychiatry", "abstract": "Modafinil is a novel vigilance-enhancing agent. We were interested if modafinil would also enhance motor excitability and improve motor performance and attention in healthy subjects. Ten volunteers received either a single oral dose of placebo or 200 mg modafinil. A randomized double-blind crossover design was used. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was employed to test intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, the cortical silent period and to obtain stimulus-response curves. In addition, M responses and F waves were recorded. Reaction time tasks, the nine-hole-peg test and the d2 attention test were also applied. These studies were performed prior to and 3 and 24 hours after drug ingestion. Modafinil did not change excitatory or inhibitory properties in the motor cortex. It did not alter corticospinal excitability and alpha motoneuronal excitability. In the modafinil group and in the placebo group, performance of the nine-hole-peg test and the d2 test improved to a similar extend over time. Thus, this study does not demonstrate significant differences between a single dose of modafinil and placebo in healthy subjects.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a complementary treatment for aphasia.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9126063", "authors": ["Martin, PI", "Naeser, MA", "Theoret, H", "Tormos, JM", "Nicholas, M", "Kurland, J", "Fregni, F", "Seekins, H", "Doron, K", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Seminars in speech and language", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was employed to probe the modulatory effects of transcranial direct current stimulation of motor cortex on motor evoked responses (MEPs) produced during motor imagery.

Cathodal stimulation induced a decrease of about 30% of MEP amplitude at rest and a 50% reduction of MEP size during imagery. Ten minutes after tDCS, MEPs at rest returned to baseline values while MEPs during motor imagery were suppressed for up to 30 min. No changes in MEP amplitude during imagery were found after anodal stimulation. tDCS could represent a powerful tool to modulate the excitability of motor areas involved in mental practice and motor imagery.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "158", "title": "Suppression of the transcallosal motor output: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in healthy subjects.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9183250", "authors": ["Trompetto, C", "Bove, M", "Marinelli, L", "Avanzino, L", "Buccolieri, A", "Abbruzzese, G"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The threshold magnetic field strength necessary to elicit a visual percept is often regarded as a measure of electrical excitability of visual cortex. Using single-pulse TMS during visual motion stimulus presentation, we investigated the relationship between different degrees of visual cortical preactivation and cortical phosphene threshold (PT). The two possible, mutually exclusive, predictions on the outcome of this experiment were that a) PT increases with stronger preactivation because of a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, or b) that PT decreases with increased preactivation because of the increase in neuronal response towards some threshold. PTs for single-pulse stimulation of the occipital lobe were determined for eight subjects while they passively viewed a horizontally drifting luminance-modulated sinewave grating. Gratings used were of four different luminance contrasts while the spatial and temporal frequencies remained constant. PTs were shown to increase significantly as the background grating increased in contrast. These results suggest that the neural activity underlying the perception of a phosphene can be considered a type of signal that can be partially masked by another signal, in this case the visual cortical activation produced by passive viewing of drifting gratings.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Different short-term modulation of cortical motor output to distal and proximal upper-limb muscles during painful sensory nerve stimulation.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "10080376", "authors": ["Urban, PP", "Solinski, M", "Best, C", "Rolke, R", "Hopf, HC", "Dieterich, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new treatment with promise for resistant depression.", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves depersonalization: a case report.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "15210904", "authors": ["Jim\u00e9nez-Genchi, AM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "CNS spectrums", "abstract": "We tested the economic feasibility of this new method compared with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).", "pages": "1786-95"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Cutaneous inputs can activate the ipsilateral primary motor cortex during bimanual sensory-driven movements in humans.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "15210878", "authors": ["Shibuya, S", "Ohki, Y"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "An economic decision analysis was used to compare the costs of three different treatment strategies for nonpsychotic severe depression.
