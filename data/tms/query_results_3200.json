Is there a \"semantic hub\" in the temporal poles where these different inputs converge to form amodal conceptual representations? Alternatively, are there distinct neural circuits that underpin our comprehension of pictures and words? Understanding words might be primarily left-lateralised, linked to other language areas, while semantic representation of pictures may be more bilateral. To elucidate this debate, we used offline, low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disrupt neural processing temporarily in the left or right temporal poles. During the induced refractory period, participants made judgements of semantic association for verbal and pictorial stimuli. The efficiency of semantic processing was reduced by rTMS, yet a perceptual task of comparable difficulty was unaffected. rTMS applied to the left or right temporal poles disrupted semantic processing for words and pictures to the same degree, while rTMS delivered at a control site had no impact. The results confirm that both temporal poles form a critical substrate within the neural network that supports conceptual knowledge, regardless of modality.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "[Non pharmacotherapeutic correction of cerebral disturbances in children with diabetes mellitus type I].", "issue": "12", "pmid": "20037524", "authors": ["Filina, NIu", "Bolotova, NV", "Manukian, VIu", "Kompaniets, OV", "Ra\u012dgorodski\u012d, IuM"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

In this study, we investigated the neuronal basis of face-name retrieval in young subjects using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The experimental task was composed of two study phases: an encoding phase and a retrieval phase. During the encoding phase, subjects saw a face (familiar or unfamiliar) followed by a name. During the retrieval phase, they saw the face together with two names and had to choose the name that was correctly associated with the face. rTMS was delivered only during retrieval. In addition, we evaluated the use of memory strategies during the task. Accordingly, subjects were subdivided into two groups: strategy users (SU) and no-strategy users (NSU). No rTMS effects were present for familiar face-name pairs, probably due to a ceiling effect. However, for unfamiliar face-name pairs, the different use of memory strategies resulted in different rTMS effects. The SU group showed a selective interference effect after right DLPFC stimulation, whereas the NSU group showed an effect after left DLPFC stimulation. Importantly, the overall performance of the two groups was comparable. We suggest that during memory retrieval the left DLPFC might be recruited when the subject does not apply deliberately a retrieval strategy whereas there is a shift to the right DLPFC if cognitive control processes that are engaged by strategies are needed to guide episodic retrieval.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Why do some promising brain-stimulation devices fail the next steps of clinical development?", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9862891", "authors": ["Edelmuth, RC", "Nitsche, MA", "Battistella, L", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Expert review of medical devices", "abstract": "The aetiology of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) remains unknown; however, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the spine deformity could be the expression of a subclinical nervous system disorder. A defective sensory input or an anomalous sensorimotor integration may lead to an abnormal postural tone and therefore the development of a spine deformity. Inhibition of the motor cortico-cortical excitability is abnormal in dystonia. Therefore, the study of cortico-cortical inhibition may shed some insight into the dystonia hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of IS. Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to study cortico-cortical inhibition and facilitation in nine adolescents with IS, five teenagers with congenital scoliosis (CS) and eight healthy age-matched controls. The effect of a previous conditioning stimulus (80% intensity of resting motor threshold) on the amplitude of the motor-evoked potential induced by the test stimulus (120% of resting motor threshold) was examined at various interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in both abductor pollicis brevis muscles. The results of healthy adolescents and those with CS showed a marked inhibitory effect of the conditioning stimulus on the response to the test stimulus at interstimulus intervals shorter than 6 ms. These findings do not differ from those reported for normal adults. However, children with IS revealed an abnormally reduced cortico-cortical inhibition at the short ISIs. Cortico-cortical inhibition was practically normal on the side of the scoliotic convexity while it was significantly reduced on the side of the scoliotic concavity. In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that a dystonic dysfunction underlies in IS. Asymmetrical cortical hyperexcitability may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IS and represents an objective neurophysiological finding that could be used clinically.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "208", "title": "Alcohol breaks down interhemispheric inhibition in females but not in males: alcohol and frontal connectivity.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10025782", "authors": ["Hoppenbrouwers, SS", "Hofman, D", "Schutter, DJ"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Psychopharmacology", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may give a functional assessment of corticospinal conduction.

Moreover, rTMS of the left parietal cortex did not modify subjects' RTs in either task. Subjects' accuracy was equally affected by rTMS in both tasks over time.

Tics are typically reduced during task performance and concentration. How this task-dependent reduction of motor symptoms is represented in the brain is not yet understood. The aim of the current research was to study motorcortical excitability at rest and during the preparation of a simple motor task. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine corticospinal excitability, short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in a group of 11 patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and age-matched healthy controls. Parameters of cortical excitability were evaluated at rest and at six points in time during the preparation of a simple finger movement. Patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome displayed significantly reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition at rest, while no differences were apparent for unconditioned motor evoked potential or intracortical facilitation. During the premovement phase, significant differences between groups were seen for single pulse motor evoked potential amplitudes and short-interval intracortical inhibition. Short-interval intracortical inhibition was reduced in the early phase of movement preparation (similar to rest) followed by a transition towards more inhibition. Subsequently modulation of short-interval intracortical inhibition was comparable to controls, while corticospinal recruitment was reduced in later phases of movement preparation. The present data support the hypothesis of motorcortical disinhibition in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome at rest. During performance of a motor task, patients start from an abnormally disinhibited level of short-interval intracortical inhibition early during movement preparation with subsequent modulation of inhibitory activity similar to healthy controls. We hypothesize that while at rest, abnormal subcortical inputs from aberrant striato-thalamic afferents target the motor cortex, during motor performance, motor cortical excitability most likely underlies top-down control from higher motor areas and prefrontal cortex, which override these abnormal subcortical inputs to guarantee adequate behavioural performance.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "Bio-heat transfer model of transcranial DC stimulation: comparison of conventional pad versus ring electrode.", "issue": "", "pmid": "7675225", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Elwassif, M", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Eleven subacute stroke patients were scanned 1-3 months after symptom onset while performing whole hand fist closure movements. After a baseline scan, patients were stimulated with inhibitory 1-Hz rTMS applied over two different locations: (i) vertex (control stimulation) and (ii) primary motor cortex (M1) of the unaffected (contralesional) hemisphere. Changes in the endogenous and task-dependent effective connectivity were assessed by DCM of a bilateral network comprising M1, lateral premotor cortex, and the supplementary motor area (SMA). The results showed that rTMS applied over contralesional M1 significantly improved the motor performance of the paretic hand. The connectivity analysis revealed that the behavioral improvements were significantly correlated with a reduction of the negative influences originating from contralesional M1 during paretic hand movements. Concurrently, endogenous coupling between ipsilesional SMA and M1 was significantly enhanced only after rTMS applied over contralesional M1. Therefore, rTMS applied over contralesional M1 may be used to transiently remodel the disturbed functional network architecture of the motor system.

In the context of a 1-shot change detection paradigm, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during different time intervals to elucidate the temporally precise involvement of PPC in change detection. While subjects attempted to detect changes between two image sets separated by a brief time interval, TMS was applied either during the presentation of picture 1 when subjects were encoding and maintaining information into visual short-term memory, or picture 2 when subjects were retrieving information relating to picture 1 and comparing it to picture 2. Our results show that change blindness occurred more often when TMS was applied during the viewing of picture 1, which implies that right PPC plays a crucial role in the processes of encoding and maintaining information in visual short-term memory.

There is a relatively widespread cortical area containing corticospinal outputs to a single muscle and thus a motoneurone pool receives corticospinal input from a wide region of the cortex. In addition, corticospinal cells themselves have divergent intraspinal branches which innervate more than one motoneuronal pool but the synergistic couplings involving the many hand muscles are likely to be more diverse than can be accommodated simply by fixed patterns of corticospinal divergence. Many studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human motor cortex have highlighted the capacity of the cortex to modify its apparent excitability in response to altered afferent inputs, training and various pathologies. Studies using cortical stimulation at 'very low' intensities which elicit only short-latency suppression of the discharge of motor units have revealed that the rapidly conducting corticospinal axons (stimulated at higher intensities) drive motoneurones in normal voluntary contractions. There are also major non-linearities generated at a spinal level in the relation between corticospinal output and the output from the motoneurone pool. For example, recent studies have revealed that the efficacy of the human corticospinal connection with motoneurones undergoes activity-dependent changes which influence the size of voluntary contractions. Hence, corticospinal drives must be sculpted continuously to compensate for the changing functional efficacy of the descending systems which activate the motoneurones.

This analysis was extended to predict a terminal polarization of a human cortical neuron as 1.44 mV during tDCS.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Brain stimulation in the study and treatment of addiction.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16857577", "authors": ["Feil, J", "Zangen, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews", "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure where a weak electrical current is applied across the scalp to modulate brain function. The proliferation of this therapy has been accompanied by isolated reports regarding concern about their safety namely skin irritation. The potential cause of skin irritation has sometimes been attributed to increased scalp temperature during stimulation. We have developed novel technology for tDCS that improves spatial focality at the cost of increased stimulation electrode current density; high density tDCS (HD-tDCS). The goal of this paper was to provide information on the thermal effects of tDCS using a MRI-derived finite element human head model. The tissue temperature increases of tDCS using conventional rectangular-pad (7 x 5 cm(2)) and HD-tDCS using the ring (4 x 1) electrode configurations were compared using a bio-heat model. Our results indicate that clinical tDCS do not increase tissue temperature and 4 x 1 ring configurations leads to a negligible increase in scalp temperature.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "67", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16809569", "authors": ["Orth, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of psychosomatic research", "abstract": "Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is getting an attentions as a promising technique with a capability of noninvasive and nonconvulsive stimulation to treat ill conditions of the brain such as depression. However, knowledge on how exactly tDCS affects the activity of neurons in the brain is still not sufficient. Precise analysis on the electromagnetic effect of tDCS on the brain requires finite element analysis (FEA) with realistic head models including anisotropy of the white matter and the skull. In this paper, we have simulated tDCS via 3-D high-resolution FEA and investigated the effect of tissue anisotropy on tDCS. The results show that the skull anisotropy induces a strong shunting effect, causing a shift of the stimulated areas, and the white matter anisotropy affects strongly the current flow directions, changing the current field distribution inside the human brain. Our presented methodology and results should be useful for more effective guiding and treatment using tDCS.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Brain oscillatory substrates of visual short-term memory capacity.", "issue": "21", "pmid": "17280510", "authors": ["Sauseng, P", "Klimesch, W", "Heise, KF", "Gruber, WR", "Holz, E", "Karim, AA", "Glennon, M", "Gerloff, C", "Birbaumer, N", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "The specific neurochemical substrate underlying the amnesia in patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is still poorly defined. Memory impairment has been linked to dysfunction of neurons in the cholinergic system. A transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol, the short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), may give direct information about the function of some cholinergic pathways in the human motor cortex. In the present study, we measured SAI in eight alcoholics with WKS and compared the data with those from a group of age-matched healthy individuals; furthermore, we correlated the individual SAI values of the WKS patients with memory and other cognitive functions. Mean SAI was significantly reduced in WKS patients when compared with the controls. SAI was increased after administration of a single dose of donezepil in a subgroup of four patients. The low score obtained in the Rey Complex Figure delayed recall test, the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and the Corsi's Block Span subtest of the WAIS-R documented a severe impairment in the anterograde memory and short-term memory. None of the correlations between SAI values and these neuropsychological tests reached significance. We provide physiological evidence of cholinergic involvement in WKS. However, this putative marker of central cholinergic activity did not significantly correlate with the memory deficit in our patients. These findings suggest that the cholinergic dysfunction does not account for the memory disorder and that damage to the cholinergic system is not sufficient to cause a persisting amnesic syndrome in WKS.", "pages": "1336-42"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Cerebellar involvement in timing accuracy of rhythmic finger movements in essential tremor.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "2222157", "authors": ["Avanzino, L", "Bove, M", "Tacchino, A", "Ruggeri, P", "Giannini, A", "Trompetto, C", "Abbruzzese, G"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Exposure to powerful magnetic fields may alter the settings of programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt valves or even cause permanent damage to these devices.
