In the present study participants synchronized finger taps with the tones of an auditory metronome. The aim of the study was to examine whether motor and premotor cortical inhibition induced by rTMS affects timing aspects of synchronization performance such as the coupling between the tap and the tone and error correction after a metronome perturbation. Metronome sequences included perturbations corresponding to a change in the duration of a single interval (phase shifts) that were either small and below the threshold for conscious perception (10 ms) or large and perceivable (50 ms). Both premotor and motor cortex stimulation induced inhibition, as reflected in a lengthening of the silent period. Neither motor nor premotor cortex rTMS altered error correction after a phase shift. However, motor cortex stimulation made participants tap closer to the tone, yielding a decrease in tap-tone asynchrony.

Motor excitability has been found to be inhibited when afferent stimuli are given to a peripheral nerve and precede TMS at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20-50 ms. This phenomenon has been referred to as short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). To better understand the functional meaning of these phenomena, we examined the effect of the size of the receptive field on SAI to cutaneous afferents in upper-limb sensorimotor areas in humans. We examined the effect of the stimulation of the isolated right first (D1), second (D2) and third finger (D3), the right second and third finger together (D23) and the right first three fingers together (D123) on the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS in hand and forearm muscles. We examined the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles. Digital stimulation preceded TMS at ISIs of 20-50 ms. The effect of D2 stimulation was MEP inhibition (SAI), which was more marked and consistent in APB and FDI muscles than in ECR and FCR muscles. Similarly, D1 and D3 stimulation caused MEP reduction, while no MEP enhancement could be found to single finger stimulation. In contrast, D123 stimulation induced less effective SAI in upper-limb muscles. MEP potentiation was recorded in some muscles to D123 stimulation. A significant difference between D2 and D123 stimulation was found in APB (ISIs = 30-50 ms) and FDI (ISIs = 40-50 ms) muscles, but not in forearm muscles. The effect to D23stimulation on MEP amplitude was intermediate between those to D2 and D123 stimulation. Our data suggest that motor excitability to cutaneous afferents may be influenced by the size of the receptive fields, this effect being the result of increasing convergence between hand afferents in the somatosensory system. These phenomena appear to be topographically arranged across the representation of upper-limb muscles.

In addition, repetitive TMS (rTMS) has long-term effects (e.g. on mood), probably mediated by neurochemical alterations. While long-term safety of rTMS with regard to cognitive functioning is well established from trials exploring its therapeutic efficacy, little is known on whether rTMS can induce changes in cognitive functioning in a time window ranging from minutes to hours, a time in which neurochemical effects correlated with stimulation have been demonstrated. This study examined effects of rTMS on three measures of executive function in healthy subjects who received one single rTMS session (40 trains of 2 s duration 20 Hz stimuli) at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Compared to a sham condition one week apart, divided attention performance was significantly impaired about 30-60 min after rTMS, while Stroop-interference and performance in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was unaffected after rTMS. Repetitive TMS of the left DLPFC, at stimulation parameters used in therapeutic studies, does not lead to a clinically relevant impairment of executive function after stimulation. However, the significant effect on divided attention suggests that cognitive effects of rTMS are not limited to the of acute stimulation, and may possibly reflect known neurochemical alterations induced by rTMS.

Antidepressant medications can effectively treat depression in epileptic patients, but drug-drug interactions and epileptogenic effects of these drugs pose therapeutic challenges. The mood-stabilizing effects of antiepileptic medications may not be sufficient to treat depression. Therefore, treatments that alleviate the burden of depression without increasing seizure risk or, better yet, with the possibility of improving seizure control are worth exploring. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, are providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of depression in epilepsy. For example, there appears to be prominent brain prefrontal hypoactivity, which may be sustained by the hyperactivity of the seizure focus. If so, neuromodulatory approaches that suppress epileptic focus hyperactivity and concurrently enhance prefrontal activity may be ideally suited. Indeed, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to yield simultaneous antiseizure and mood effects. Another neuromodulatory technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can also modulate brain activity, but in a noninvasive, painless, and focal manner. Depending on the stimulation parameters, it is possible to enhance or reduce activity in the targeted brain region. Furthermore, TMS has been shown to be effective in treating depression, and preliminary data suggest that this treatment may also be effective for epilepsy treatment.

Five single-pulse TMS conditions were performed based on the individual resting motor threshold (RMT): (1) 80%; (2) 100%; (3) 120%; (4) 130%; and (5) sham. Simple self-paced movements of the right first finger were also executed. We evaluated the reactions to magnetic stimulation and movement conditions using event-related power and event-related coherence transformations of alpha and beta rhythms. Event-related power reflected regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies, while event-related coherence reflected the inter-regional functional coupling of oscillatory neural activity. The event-related power transformation revealed that the magnetic pulse modulated cortical oscillations within the first half second for both frequency ranges. For the alpha rhythm, threshold TMS induced a small decrease in the amplitude of EEG oscillations over the stimulation site, while for both rhythms, a progressive synchronization was observed as the intensity of TMS was increased in both hemispheres. Movement onset produced a greater bilateral decrease of power compared with the effects of a magnetic pulse. The event-related coherence revealed that TMS enhanced the electrode connectivity of both hemispheres. Additionally, it was more enhanced within the first 500 ms following stimulation and was seen only for the alpha frequency rhythm. The increase of functional connectivity between cortical areas was minor for magnetic stimulation conditions compared with that for finger movements. The single-pulse TMS over M1 partially modulated the motor cortex generators of oscillatory activity, while a simple active self-paced movement of the right first finger induced greater cortex activation and coupling between cortical regions. We propose that finger movements impose higher functional demands on the motor system compared to artificial magnetic stimulation. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the human motor system may be based on network-like oscillatory cortical activity and might be modulated by brief electromagnetic sub- and suprathreshold pulses applied to M1, suggesting a phenomenon of resetting.", "pages": "1670-5"}, {"volume": "168", "title": "Corticospinal facilitation during first and third person imagery.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "7489686", "authors": ["Fourkas, AD", "Avenanti, A", "Urgesi, C", "Aglioti, SM"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Twenty-three inpatients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn; DSM-IV) criteria for major depression were invited to participate in the study. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Patients were given 10 stimuli over the frontal area of both sides for a total of 20 stimuli in a session. The subjects had daily TMS session for 5 days as an add-on therapy. In addition, six patients had their quantitative (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer SPECT images measured before and after TMS treatment. Compared with the value 2 days prior to the start of TMS therapy (24.2 +/- 4.9), the average HAM-D scale dropped significantly to 15.3 +/- 6.6 on the day after completion of such therapy. The results of SPECT showed that the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the bilateral frontal region had increased in four out of six patients when comparing before and after treatment.

In this study we investigated the effect of cathodal DC stimulation on spontaneous neural activity and on motor responses evoked by stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system. We studied 17 healthy volunteers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) of the motor area were used to study the effects of cathodal tDCS (1.5 mA, 10 min) on resting motor threshold and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in response to cathodal tDCS was analysed by power spectral density (PSD). Motor axonal excitability changes in response to transcutaneous DC stimulation of the ulnar nerve (0.3 mA, 10 min) were assessed by testing changes in the size of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) elicited by submaximal nerve stimulation. Cathodal tDCS over the motor area for 10 min increased the motor threshold and decreased the size of MEPs evoked by TMS for at least 60 min after current offset (t(0) 71.7 +/- 5%, t(20) 50.8 +/- 11%, t(40) 47.7 +/- 7.7%, and t(60) 39.7 +/- 6.4%, P < 0.01). The tDCS also significantly decreased the size of MEPs elicited by TES (t(0) 64 +/- 16.4%, P = 0.09; t(20) 67.6 +/- 10.8%, P = 0.06; and t(40) 58.3 +/- 9.9%, P < 0.05).

At the peripheral level cathodal DC stimulation increased the size of the ulnar nerve CMAP (175 +/- 34.3%, P < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that the after-effects of tDCS have a non-synaptic mechanism of action based upon changes in neural membrane function.

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, twenty-one right-handed subjects received 20 mg daily of either paroxetine or a placebo over a period of 30 days separated by a period of 3 months wash-out. The TMS study is presented here correlated with some results of the motor behavior study (finger tapping test) and the fMRI study (primary sensorimotor cortex (S1M1) volume of activation). TMS was used to test motor threshold (MT), motor evoked potential recruitment curve (RC), cortical silent period (CSP) and paired-pulse intracortical inhibition and facilitation (ICI, ICF). Chronic administration of paroxetine did not modulate ICI or CSP but induced a significant enhancement of mean ICF (ANOVA P=0.04), which significantly correlated with increase of speed in a finger tapping test (P=0.02). This suggests a modulation of cortical interneuronal excitatory pathways without changes in the excitability of cortical inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. A decrease of RC (ANOVA P=0.05) was also observed after 30 days intake of paroxetine in comparison with placebo and was associated with changes of fMRI activation intensity (left S1M1 hypoactivation, ), without changes of S1M1 activation volume. Finally, the different modulation of RC and ICF after chronic administration of paroxetine compared to single dose (opposite effects) emphasizes the different pharmacological action of the drug at cortical level depending on its acute or long-term administration.", "pages": "1670-5"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "An increased precision comparison of TMS-induced motor cortex BOLD fMRI response for image-guided versus function-guided coil placement.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11673696", "authors": ["Denslow, S", "Bohning, DE", "Bohning, PA", "Lomarev, MP", "George, MS"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology", "abstract": "Tinnitus is a distressing symptom for which few treatments exist.

We asked our participants to perform four different tasks, two of which involved fingers and the other two involving numbers, during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the posterior parietal lobe of either hemisphere. In the finger tasks, they were required to transform a tactile stimulus randomly delivered on one of their fingers into a speeded key-press response either with the same or with the homologous finger on the opposite hand. In the numerical tasks, they were asked to perform a magnitude or a parity matching on pairs of single digits, in the context of arithmetically related or unrelated numerical primes. In accordance with the original anatomical hypothesis put forward by Gerstmann [Gerstmann, J. (1924). Fingeragnosie: eine umschriebene Stoerung der Orienterung am eigenen Koerper. Wiener clinische Wochenschrift, 37, 1010-12], we found that rTMS over the left angular gyrus disrupted tasks requiring access to the finger schema and number magnitude processing in the same group of participants. In addition to the numerous studies which have employed special populations such as neurological patients and children, our data confirm the presence of a relationship between numbers and body knowledge in skilled adults who no longer use their fingers for solving simple arithmetical tasks.", "pages": "1670-5"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation highlights the sensorimotor side of empathy for pain.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "15721737", "authors": ["Avenanti, A", "Bueti, D", "Galati, G", "Aglioti, SM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "Dystonia is a diverse movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle co-contraction of the agonist and antagonist, which may cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal posture. Dystonia is the least understood movement disorder associated with the basal ganglia dysfunction. While dysfunction of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical motor circuits is likely to play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of dystonia, the disorder does not easily fit into the hypokinetic or the hyperkinetic category of basal ganglion diseases. There was evidence of widespread impairment of the inhibition involving multiple levels of the nervous system. There was also significant data to support the notion that the sensory function and sensorymotor integration were debit in patients with dystonia. The reciprocal inhibition curves between the forearm muscles were abnormal at the spinal cord level, as well as the blink reflex recovery curves at the brain stem level. The motor cortex excitability was enhanced while the transcranial magnetic stimulation. The dystonia showed decreased inhibition of the intracortical inhibition and facilitation and short cortical silent period. The pre-movement gating of the somatosensory evoked potentials and the somatosensory homunculus were abnormal in dystonia. This review provides an overview of the recent studies of the pathophysiology of dystonia, with an emphasis on the cortical plasticity.

Single pulse TMS was applied over the PPC, either unilaterally or bilaterally, 150, 200, or 250 ms after digit presentation. Sham TMS was used as a control condition to take into account the unspecific effects of TMS on reaction time (RT). The main finding of the present study is a significant increase in RTs when comparing digits close to 5 following a disruption either of the left PPC alone or of both PPC simultaneously. The comparison of digits far from 5 was unaltered by disrupting only one PPC but RTs were found increased after bilateral PPC stimulation. These disruptive effects were observed irrespective of the TMS delay. We concluded that coding precise numerical values requires the integrity of the left PPC, as suggested by the deficit in discriminating close digits consequent to its disruption. In contrast, approximate comparisons can be processed either by the left or right PPC, since simultaneous bilateral TMS was needed to alter the comparison of digits far from 5.", "pages": "1670-5"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increases tolerance to human experimental pain.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11268212", "authors": ["Graff-Guerrero, A", "Gonz\u00e1lez-Olvera, J", "Fres\u00e1n, A", "G\u00f3mez-Mart\u00edn, D", "M\u00e9ndez-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, JC", "Pellicer, F"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Brain research.

Treatment involves combining individual, behavioural, group, and family therapies, possibly with medications. Studies have found that medication, chiefly antidepressants, could be of help in bulimia nervosa but the evidence is weaker for use in anorexia nervosa. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique that briefly stimulates or depresses cortical areas within the brain. It has been used in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, especially major depression, which is a condition that patients with eating disorders often experience as a significant comorbidity. Given that both disorders may share a common pathogenesis, this report proposes that rTMS may represent an alternative strategy for the treatment of eating disorders. Other evidence that supports this notion comes from animal studies that show that rTMS can change feeding behaviours and central neurotransmitters related to the regulation of eating behaviours. Further investigation into the dose, duration and type of rTMS stimulus is needed to verify the efficacy of this intervention in eating disorders.", "pages": "1670-5"}]
