Recently, activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during offers experienced as unfair in the Ultimatum Game was suggested to subserve goal maintenance in this task. This is restricted to correlational evidence, however, and it remains unclear whether the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is crucial for strategic decision-making. The present study used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in order to investigate the causal role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in strategic decision-making in the Ultimatum Game. The results showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex resulted in an altered decision-making strategy compared with sham stimulation.

Participants reported digits in a relevant color (\"targets\") but not those in an irrelevant color (\"nontargets\") from a brief masked display, in which a target could appear alone or together with an accompanying item (nontarget or target) in the same or opposite hemifield. Generally, a given target is identified better when presented with a nontarget than with another target, indicating top-down selection of task-relevant targets; this applied here with no rTMS or left PPC rTMS. However, rTMS over the right PPC changed the performance pattern. A left target no longer impeded report of a right target more strongly than did a left nontarget, whereas the greater impact of a right target than a right nontarget in disrupting report of a left target was increased. Formal analysis in terms of Bundesen's (1990) theory of visual attention indicated that right PPC rTMS diminished top-down control for the left hemifield while enhancing this for the right hemifield, particularly for bilateral two-item displays. These findings indicate a role for right PPC in top-down spatial selection, which applies even when the target is defined by a nonspatial property (here color).", "pages": "1849-52"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Motor evoked potential monitoring during cerebral aneurysm surgery: technical aspects and comparison of transcranial and direct cortical stimulation.", "issue": "4 Suppl", "pmid": "16234682", "authors": ["Szel\u00e9nyi, A", "Kothbauer, K", "de Camargo, AB", "Langer, D", "Flamm, ES", "Deletis, V"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "This study evaluates technical aspects, handling, and safety of intraoperatively applied transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) for eliciting muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs) during cerebral aneurysm surgery.", "pages": "1849-52"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "[Study of respiratory muscle function in intensive care: recent advances (1998-2004)--ATS/ERS workshop].", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16227942", "authors": ["Demoule, A", "Brochard, L"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Revue des maladies respiratoires", "abstract": "In 119 patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm surgery, mMEPs were evoked by a train of five stimuli with individual pulse duration of 0.5 milliseconds, a repetition rate of 2 Hz, and constant current anodal stimulation.

Subjects maintained a weak isometric contraction of the right first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI), and either increased the level of contraction (Contraction), terminated the contraction (Relaxation), or maintained it (No-go) depending on a visual cue. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) and the silent period (SP) were recorded from the FDI during motor activity. To measure intra-cortical inhibition (ICI), we also performed double-pulse TMS, applying subthreshold conditioning stimuli at interstimulus intervals of 2 ms. When single-pulse TMS was given just prior to muscle relaxation (-21 to -70 ms), the MEP was reduced while the SP was unchanged. Intra-cortical inhibition was smaller just prior to the muscle relaxation.

In addition there is a growing interest in the role of central nervous system (CNS) reorganization. Much of the evidence supporting this comes from animal models of focal brain injury, but non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography now allow the study of the working human brain. Using these techniques it is apparent that the motor system of the brain adapts to damage in a way that attempts to preserve motor function. This has been demonstrated after stroke, as part of the ageing process, and even after disruption of normal motor cortex with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The result of this reorganization is a new functional architecture, one which will vary from patient to patient depending on the anatomy of the damage, the biological age of the patient and lastly the chronicity of the lesion. The success of any given therapeutic intervention will depend on how well it interacts with this new functional architecture. Thus it is crucial that the study of novel therapeutic strategies for treating motor impairment after stroke take account of this. This review maps out the attempts to describe functionally relevant adaptive changes in the human brain following focal damage. A greater understanding of how these changes are related to the recovery process will allow not only the development of novel therapeutic techniques that are based on neurobiological principles and designed to minimize impairment in patients suffering from stroke, but also to target these therapies at the appropriate patients.", "pages": "1849-52"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Dissociating linguistic processes in the left inferior frontal cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "35", "pmid": "12949224", "authors": ["Gough, PM", "Nobre, AC", "Devlin, JT"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "In meditation both the quality and the contents of consciousness may be voluntarily changed, making it an obvious target in the quest for the neural correlate of consciousness. Here we present the results of a positron emission tomography study of yoga nidra relaxation meditation when compared with the normal resting conscious state. Meditation is accompanied by a relatively increased perfusion in the sensory imagery system: hippocampus and sensory and higher order association regions, with decreased perfusion in the executive system: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, striatum, thalamus, pons, and cerebellum. To identify regions active in both systems we performed a principal component analysis of the results. This separated the blood flow data into two groups of regions, explaining 25 and 18% of their variance: One group corresponded to the executive system, and the other to the systems supporting sensory imagery. A small group of regions contributed considerably to both networks: medial parietal and medial prefrontal cortices, together with the striatum. The inclusion of the striatum and our subsequent finding of increased striatal dopamine binding to D2 receptors during meditation suggested dopaminergic regulation of this circuit. We then investigated the neural networks supporting episodic retrieval of judgments of individuals with different degrees of self-relevance, in the decreasing order: self, best friend, and the Danish queen. We found that all conditions activated a medial prefrontal - precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. This activation occurred together with the activation of the left lateral prefrontal/temporal cortex. The latter was dependent on the requirement of retrieval of semantic information, being most pronounced in the \"queen\" condition. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, targeting precuneus, was then applied to the medial parietal region to transiently disrupt the normal function of the circuitry. We found a decreased efficiency of retrieval of self-judgment compared to the judgment of best friend.

The present study aimed to elucidate further the temporal characteristics of motion processing in hMT/V5+ by investigating all critical time windows currently debated in the literature. In contrast to previous studies, we used TMS neuronavigation based on individual fMRI results of five participants to target hMT/V5+, applying single-pulse TMS at 24 different time windows (-50 till +200 ms relative to stimulus onset). We revealed that TMS significantly impaired motion perception when applied over hMT/V5+ at 40 to 30 ms before as well as 130 to 150 ms after onset of the moving stimuli. While the late effective time window conforms to results from previous experiments, we did not find evidence for an early time window around 0 ms that has been reported in other studies. Our neuronavigation approach enabled us to quantify the interindividual variance in the exact location of hMT/V5+ and the respective TMS target position on the skull of the participants.

The identified literature was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for its efficacy and then categorised into four levels of evidence (A-D). This first part of the guidelines covers disease definition, classification, epidemiology and course of schizophrenia, as well as the management of the acute phase treatment. These guidelines are primarily concerned with the biological treatment (including antipsychotic medication, other pharmacological treatment options, electroconvulsive therapy, adjunctive and novel therapeutic strategies) of adults suffering from schizophrenia.", "pages": "1849-52"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Therapeutic trial of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation after acute ischemic stroke.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16195466", "authors": ["Khedr, EM", "Ahmed, MA", "Fathy, N", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Idiopathic tinnitus is a frequent and debilitating disorder of largely unknown pathophysiology.

At low frequency (1 Hz), rTMS is assumed to decrease cortical excitability; however, the degree of TMS effect on cortical language areas may depend on the localization of the stimulation coil with respect to the inter-individual anatomo-functional variations. Hence, we aimed at investigating individual brain areas involved in semantic and phonological auditory processes. We hypothesized that active rTMS targeted over Wernicke's area might modify the performance during a language-fragment-detection task. Sentences in native or foreign languages were presented to 12 right-handed male healthy volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 3D-functional maps localized the posterior temporal activation (Wernicke) in each subject and MRI anatomical cortical landmarks were used to define Broca's pars opercularis (F3Op). A frameless stereotaxy system was used to guide the TMS coil position over Wernicke's and F3Op areas in each subject. Active and placebo randomized rTMS sessions were applied at 1 Hz, 110% of motor threshold, during the same language-fragment-detection task. Accuracy and response time (RT) were recorded. RT was significantly decreased by active rTMS compared to placebo over Wernicke's area, and was more decreased for native than for foreign languages. No significant RT change was observed for F3Op area. rTMS conditions did not impair participants' accuracy. Thus, low-frequency rTMS over Wernicke's area can speed-up the response to a task tapping on native language perception in healthy volunteers. This individually-guided stimulation study confirms that facilitatory effects are not confined to high-frequency rTMS.", "pages": "1849-52"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Effect of left prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on food craving.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "16194530", "authors": ["Uher, R", "Yoganathan, D", "Mogg, A", "Eranti, SV", "Treasure, J", "Campbell, IC", "McLoughlin, DM", "Schmidt, U"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The intensity dependence of the local and remote effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on human motor cortex was characterized using positron-emission tomography (PET) measurements of regional blood flow (BF) and concurrent electromyographic (EMG) measurements of the motor-evoked potential (MEP). Twelve normal volunteers were studied by applying 3 Hz TMS to the hand region of primary motor cortex (M1(hand)). Three stimulation intensities were used: 75%, 100%, and 125% of the motor threshold (MT). MEP amplitude increased nonlinearly with increasing stimulus intensity. The rate of rise in MEP amplitude was greater above MT than below. The hemodynamic response in M1(hand) was an increase in BF. Hemodynamic variables quantified for M1(hand) included value-normalized counts (VNC), intensity (z-score), and extent (mm(3)). All three hemodynamic response variables increased nonlinearly with stimulus intensity, closely mirroring the MEP intensity-response function. VNC was the hemodynamic response variable which showed the most significant effect of TMS intensity. VNC correlated strongly with MEP amplitude, both within and between subjects. Remote regions showed varying patterns of intensity response, which we interpret as reflecting varying levels of neuronal excitability and/or functional coupling in the conditions studied.", "pages": "1849-52"}]
