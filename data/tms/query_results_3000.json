In two experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt neural activity in the RTPJ transiently before moral judgment (experiment 1, offline stimulation) and during moral judgment (experiment 2, online stimulation). In both experiments, TMS to the RTPJ led participants to rely less on the actor's mental states. A particularly striking effect occurred for attempted harms (e.g., actors who intended but failed to do harm): Relative to TMS to a control site, TMS to the RTPJ caused participants to judge attempted harms as less morally forbidden and more morally permissible.

Studies showing that the reversal of cortical reorganization in patients with spontaneous or provoked pain is accompanied by pain relief stimulated the search for novel alternatives how to modulate the cortical excitability as a strategy to relieve pain. Recently, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were proposed as suitable methods for modulation of cortical excitability. Both techniques (TMS and tDCS) have been clinically investigated in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with various clinical pathologies and variety of pain syndromes. Although there is less evidence on tDCS as compared with TMS, the findings on tDCS in patients with pain are promising, showing an analgesic effect of tDCS, and observations up to date justify the use of tDCS for the treatment of pain in selected patient populations. tDCS has been shown to be very safe if utilized within the current protocols.

Many respective studies make the implicit assumption that neuronal synchronization affects neuronal interactions. Indeed, when neurons synchronize, their output spikes reach postsynaptic neurons together, trigger coincidence detection mechanisms, and therefore have an enhanced impact. There is ample experimental evidence demonstrating this consequence of neuronal synchronization, but beyond this, beta/gamma-band synchronization within a group of neurons might also modulate the impact of synaptic input to that synchronized group. This would constitute a separate mechanism through which synchronization affects neuronal interactions, but direct in vivo evidence for this putative mechanism is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that synchronized beta-band activity of a neuronal group modulates the efficacy of synaptic input to that group in-phase with the beta rhythm. This response modulation was not an addition of rhythmic activity onto the average response but a rhythmic modulation of multiplicative input gain. Our results demonstrate that beta-rhythmic activity of a neuronal target group multiplexes input gain along the rhythm cycle.

We asked normal human subjects to perform a prosaccade or antisaccade task based on a cue and examined the effective connectivity of the neural network based on the pattern of neural impulse transmission induced by stimulation of the frontal eye field (FEF). Effective connectivity during the task preparation period was dependent on the task that subjects had performed on the previous trial, regardless of the upcoming task. The strength of this persistent effective connectivity was associated with saccade slowing especially on trials after controlled antisaccade. In contrast, the pattern of regional activation changed depending on the upcoming task regardless of the previous task and the decrease in activation was associated with errors in upcoming antisaccade task.

Subjects moved the wrist from an initial extended to a final flexed position (and vice versa). Passive wrist muscle forces were compensated with a torque motor such that wrist muscle activity was equalized at the two positions. It appeared that motoneuronal excitability tested by brief muscle stretches was also similar at these positions. Responses to mechanical perturbations before and after movement showed that the wrist threshold position was reset when voluntary changes in the joint angle were made. Although the excitability of motoneurons was similar at the two positions, the same transcranial magnetic stimulus (TMS) elicited a wrist extensor jerk in the extension position and a flexor jerk in the flexion position. Extensor motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS at the wrist extension position were substantially bigger compared to those at the flexion position and vice versa for flexor MEPs. MEPs were substantially reduced when subjects fully relaxed wrist muscles and the wrist was held passively in each position. Results suggest that the corticospinal pathway, possibly with other descending pathways, participates in threshold position control, a process that pre-determines the spatial frame of reference in which the neuromuscular periphery is constrained to work. This control strategy would underlie not only intentional changes in the joint position, but also muscle relaxation.

Both animal models and functional imaging data in tinnitus patients suggest that tinnitus is associated with increased neuronal activity, increased synchronicity and functional reorganisation in the auditory cortex. Therefore, targeted modulation of auditory cortex has been proposed as a new therapeutic approach for chronic tinnitus. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non invasive method for modulation of cortical activity, has been applied in different ways in patients with chronic tinnitus. Single sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the temporal cortex have been used to transiently interfere with the intensity of tinnitus. Repeated sessions of low-frequency rTMS have been investigated as a treatment for tinnitus. Here, we review data from clinical trials and discuss potential neurobiological mechanisms with special focus on the relevance of the stimulation target and the method of TMS coil positioning. Different functional neuroimaging techniques are used for detecting tinnitus-related changes in brain activity. They converge in the finding of increased neuronal activity in the central auditory system, but they differ in the exact localisation of these changes, which in turn results in uncertainty about the optimal target for rTMS treatment. In this context, it is not surprising that the currently available studies do not demonstrate clear evidence for superiority of neuronavigational coil positioning.

Single pulse TMS studies have targeted the dorsolateral premotor cortex (dlPMC) to characterize premotor-motor interactions in movement disorders. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) trials have targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to treat depression. In almost all previous studies, these targets have been defined according to a \"standard\" scalp distance to the site of stimulation evoking motor responses of maximal amplitude in the contralateral hand (\"hand motor hotspot\" corresponding to the primary motor cortex, M1). The \"standard\" procedure of coil positioning locates the dlPMC and dlPFC as 2-3 and 5cm, respectively, anterior to the \"hand motor hotspot\". The aim of our study was to compare the locations of M1, dlPMC and dlPFC targets provided by the \"standard\" procedure of coil positioning and those provided by using a neuronavigation system integrating individual brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-two patients were enrolled, all being treated for depressive symptoms in the context of chronic pain syndrome. The centers of the dlPMC and dlPFC regions were accurately targeted by the \"standard\" procedure in 14 and eight patients (64 and 36% of the series), respectively. In the other patients, the \"standard\" procedure located the dlPMC target on the M1/dlPMC border and the dlPFC target on the dlPMC/dlPFC border. On average, the MRI-guided location of M1, dlPMC, and dlPFC was, respectively, 6.1mm posterior, 31.7mm anterior and 69.0mm anterior to the \"hand motor hotspot\". The \"standard\" procedure failed to accurately locate the dlPMC and dlPFC targets by about 1 and 2cm, respectively. A statistical analysis of the MRI coordinates (x, y, z) of the targets revealed that the M1 target was more posterior, the dlPMC target more superficial and the dlPFC target more anterior, lateral, and deeper, using neuronavigation compared to the \"standard\" procedure. This study confirms that the \"standard\" procedure of coil positioning is not accurate to target a desired cortical region. Target location can be improved by the use of a navigation system taking individual brain anatomy into account. The present results incline to be cautious on the pathophysiological interpretations of previous results reported in TMS studies based on \"standard\" targeting, e.g. regarding premotor-motor interactions. Similarly, the inaccuracy of the \"standard\" procedure of coil positioning could partly explain the between-study variability of the therapeutic effects produced by rTMS in patients with depression.

This study was designed to determine the effect of different frequencies of NMES applied over the common peroneal nerve on changes in CS excitability for the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. We hypothesized that higher frequencies of stimulation would produce larger increases in CS excitability than lower frequencies. NMES was applied at 10, 50, 100, or 200 Hz during separate sessions held at least 48 h apart. The stimulation was delivered in a 20 s on, 20 s off cycle for 40 min using a 1 ms pulse width. The intensity of stimulation was set to evoke an M-wave in response to a single pulse that was 15% of the maximal M-wave. CS excitability was evaluated by the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in TA evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation. MEPs were recorded immediately before and after the 40 min of NMES and in each 20 s \"off\" period. For each subject, MEPs recorded during three successive \"off\" periods were averaged together (n = 9 MEPs), providing a temporal resolution of 2 min for assessing changes in CS excitability. When delivering NMES at 100 Hz, MEPs became significantly elevated from those evoked before the stimulation at the 24th min, and there was a twofold increase in MEP amplitude after 40 min. NMES delivered at 10, 50, and 200 Hz did not significantly alter MEP amplitude. The amplitude of MEPs evoked in soleus and vastus medialis followed similar patterns as those evoked simultaneously in TA, but these changes were mostly not of statistical significance. There were no changes in the ratio of maximal H-reflex to maximal M-wave in TA or soleus. These experiments demonstrate a frequency-dependent effect of NMES on CS excitability for TA and show that, under the conditions of the present study, 100-Hz stimulation was more effective than 10, 50, and 200 Hz. This effect of NMES on CS excitability was strongest in the stimulated muscle and may be mediated primarily at a supraspinal level. These results contribute to a growing body of knowledge about how the afferent volley generated during NMES influences the CNS and have implications for identifying optimal NMES parameters to augment CS excitability for rehabilitation of dorsiflexion after CNS injury.", "pages": "6753-8"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Investigating face-property specific processing in the right OFA.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8164834", "authors": ["Kadosh, KC", "Walsh, V", "Kadosh, RC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Social cognitive and affective neuroscience", "abstract": "A 48 year-old woman presented with an 18 month history of bizarre and complex delusions on a background of social, behavioral and cognitive decline over several years.

The present study investigated the functional role of the rOFA with regard to different face properties (identity, expression, and gaze) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Experiment 1 showed that the rOFA integrates information across different face properties: performance for the combined processing of identity and expression decreased after TMS to the rOFA, while no impairment was seen in gaze processing. In Experiment 2 we examined the temporal dynamics of this effect. We pinpointed the impaired integrative computation to 170 ms post stimulus presentation. Together the results suggest that TMS to the rOFA affects the integrative processing of facial identity and expression at a mid-latency processing stage.", "pages": "6753-8"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Combining functional neuroimaging with off-line brain stimulation: modulation of task-related activity in language areas.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15661100", "authors": ["Balslev, D", "Gowen, E", "Miall, RC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "In this work, a digital signal peripheral interface controller (dsPIC) based repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulator (rTMS) was designed and tested under low voltages.

Three types of compensatory mechanisms seem to operate in aphasic patients with left hemisphere damage: (1) functional recovery of the damaged area in the left hemisphere, (2) activation of the perilesional area in the left hemisphere, and (3) activation of the right frontal area (area homologous to the language-relevant area). Although there are some pitfalls in the interpretation of neuroimaging, it is recommended that the areas that compensate for impaired language function should be clarified prior to the initiation of neurorehabilitation for aphasia. The clinical effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and pharmacotherapy for aphasia has been recently studied. We administered low-frequency rTMS and language therapy to 4 stroke patients with motor-dominant aphasia for 6 consecutive days. The application site of rTMS was determined on the basis of the findings of pretreatment fMRI during word repetition tasks. Our novel approach resulted in significant improvement in language functions. The results of some double-blind placebo-controlled trials on aphasic patients have indicated that levodopa, dextroamphetamine, and donepezil play a critical role in the recovery from aphasia. We anticipate limitless future possibilities for the intensive neurorehabilitation of aphasic patients, including constraint-induced language therapy, rTMS application, and pharmacotherapy.

By utilizing the same semantic task across semantic dementia, rTMS, and distortion-corrected fMRI in normal participants, we directly compared the results across the 3 methods for the first time.

Resting state fMRI scans were obtained from 18 patients with schizophrenia. Patients were assessed before and after a 6 day treatment with 1 Hz rTMS to the left TPJ, or placebo treatment with sham rTMS to the same location. We assessed functional connectivity between a priori defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) comprising the putative AVH network and the bilateral TPJ seed regions, targeted with rTMS. Symptom improvement following rTMS treatment was observed in the left rTMS group, whereas no change at occurred in the placebo group. Although no corresponding changes were observed in the functional connections previously found to be associated with AVH severity, an increase in connectivity between the left TPJ and the right insula was observed in group receiving rTMS to the left TPJ. The placebo group conversely showed a decrease in connectivity between the left TPJ and left anterior cingulate. We conclude that application of 1 Hz rTMS to the left TPJ region may affect functional connectivity of the targeted region.

In two patients with refractory hand pain successfully treated by EMCS, the presence of implanted epidural cervical electrodes for spinal cord stimulation permitted to study the descending volleys generated by EMCS in order to better appraise the neural circuits involved in EMCS effects. Direct and indirect volleys (D- and I-waves) were produced depending on electrode polarity and montage and stimulus intensity. At low-intensity, anodal monopolar EMCS generated D-waves, suggesting direct activation of corticospinal fibers, whereas cathodal EMCS generated I2-waves, suggesting transsynaptic activation of corticospinal tract. The bipolar electrode configuration used in chronic EMCS to produce maximal pain relief generated mostly I3-waves. This result suggests that EMCS induces analgesia by activating top-down controls originating from intracortical horizontal fibers or interneurons but not by stimulating directly the pyramidal tract. The descending volleys elicited by bipolar EMCS are close to those elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation using a coil with posteroanterior orientation.
