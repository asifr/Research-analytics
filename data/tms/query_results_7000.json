We have hypothesized that deficient EP habituation in migraine could be due to a reduced preactivation level of sensory cortices because of hypofunctioning subcortico-cortical aminergic pathways. This is not in keeping with simple hyperexcitability of the cortex, which has been suggested by some, but not all, studies of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

We report here our results on the reproducibility of the rTMS effect studied in ten of these subjects by repeating the recordings for each frequency three times on different days. We have also reanalysed the data obtained in 24 normal subjects, looking separately at the results in those stimulated at an intensity equal to phosphene threshold (group 1; n=14) and those stimulated at 110% of motor threshold because of unelicitable phosphenes (group 2; n=10). We finally determined the precise duration of the rTMS effect. Despite some interindividual variability, the effects of both rTMS frequencies on first block amplitude, habituation between first and sixth block and habituation slope over the six blocks were highly reproducible. The only difference between the two groups of subjects was the effect of 1 Hz rTMS on the second measured PR-VEP component. Whereas first block amplitude of the first P1-N1 component and habituation were decreased in both groups, such a decrease was found for the second P1-N2 component only in group 1 stimulated at phosphene threshold. The dishabituation of the N1-P1 component after 1 Hz rTMS was maximal at 15 min, but lasted up to 33 min, while that of P1-N2 disappeared after 3 min. There was a non-significant trend ( p=0.06) for a reduction of first block amplitude after 10 Hz rTMS in the total group of subjects, but no effect on habituation. The inhibitory effect of 1 Hz rTMS, which reduces in healthy controls both first block PR-VEP amplitude and habituation, probably by decreasing the preactivation excitability level of the underlying visual cortex, is thus reproducible and long lasting. Long trains of 10 Hz rTMS tend to attenuate reproducibly the cortical preactivation level in normal subjects, but they do not affect habituation at all, which contrasts with their effect in migraineurs, in whom, as previously reported, they significantly correct the habituation deficit. The absence of an effect of 1 Hz rTMS on PR-VEP P1-N2 in subjects stimulated at 110% of motor threshold may be explained by the deeper anatomical location of the cortical generators of this component and the lower stimulation intensity used.

Preclinical findings have shown that prefrontal rTMS can modulate the function of fronto-limbic circuits, which is reversibly altered in major depression. rTMS has also been found to exert effects on neurotransmitter systems involved in the pathophysiology of major depression (e.g. stimulates subcortical dopamine release and acts on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, which is dysregulated in depression). To date, numerous open and controlled clinical trials with widely differing stimulation parameters have explored the antidepressant potential of rTMS. Though conducted with small sample sizes, the majority of the controlled trials demonstrated significant antidepressant effects of active rTMS compared with a sham condition. Effect sizes, however, varied from modest to substantial, and the patient selection focused on therapy-resistant cases. Moreover, the average treatment duration was approximately 2 weeks, which is short compared with other antidepressant interventions. Larger multicentre trials, which would be mandatory to demonstrate the antidepressant effectiveness of rTMS, have not been conducted to date.A putative future application of rTMS may be the treatment of patients who did not tolerate or did not respond to antidepressant pharmacotherapy before trying more invasive strategies such as electroconvulsive therapy and vagus nerve stimulation. Theoretically, rTMS may be also applied early in the course of disease in order to speed up and increase the effects of antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

Due to visual suppression during the saccade, the artificial introduction of a random small target jump during that short period remains undetected and triggers after the end of the primary saccade a normal 'corrective saccade'. As a result this procedure simulates an error in the planning of the primary saccade. On the other hand optimum hand pointing (trade-off between movement time and accuracy) is considered classically to involve a natural parallel initiation of saccade and hand response based on a poor peripheral retinal location, and a further amendment of the hand motor response based on the retinal error provided by the simultaneous vision of target and hand during the movement home phase. To test the hypothesis that the retinal feedback at the end of the primary saccade is used to update the visual target position and amend the ongoing hand motor response, we developed a paradigm involving both an optimum hand pointing and an undetected random target perturbation during the orienting saccade. In order to show that the amendments were controlled by a loop comparing the perceived target location with the dynamic hand position signal, vision of the limb was removed at movement onset. Results showed that the movement was smoothly monitored on-line without additional time processing demands. This functional property of flexibility of the ongoing hand motor response, was generalized from movement extent to movement direction. The undetectability of the perturbation at a conscious level was not a prerequisite for motor flexibility, which was further shown to depend on a critical phase of the limb movement beyond which the latter was no longer amendable, even when the limb was visible. The hand pointing flexibility was further generalised from pointing to the more complex hand reaching and grasping process. It was shown that the flexibility of both the transport and the grasp components were closely coupled. A careful analysis of the data suggested the controlled variable to be the general posture of the upper limb, reaching Bernstein's intuitions about redundancy reduction in skeletomotor systems with degrees of freedom in excess.

Saccades may also be used as a convenient model of motricity to study general cognitive processes preparing movements, such as attention, spatial memory and motivation. Visuo-spatial attention appears to be controlled by a bilateral parieto-frontal network comprising different parts of the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal areas involved in saccade control, suggesting that visual attentional shifts and saccades are closely linked. Recently, our understanding of the cortical control of spatial memory has noticeably progressed by using the simple visuo-oculomotor model represented by the memory-guided saccade paradigm, in which a single saccade is made to the remembered position of a unique visual item presented a while before. TMS studies have determined that, after a brief stage of spatial integration in the posterior parietal cortex (inferior to 300 ms), short-term spatial memory (i.e. up to 15-20 s) is controlled by the DLPFC. Behavioral and lesion studies have shown that medium-term spatial memory (between 15-20 s and a few minutes) is specifically controlled by the parahippocampal cortex, before long-term memorization (i.e. after a few minutes) in the hippocampal formation. Lastly, it has been shown that the posterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex, called the cingulate eye field, is involved in motivation and the preparation of all intentional saccades, but not in reflexive saccades.

Reports focusing on cortical myoclonus, except for epilepsia partialis continua, in childhood have been limited in Japan. One reason for this could be that Japanese pediatric neurologists are not familiar with the backaveraging technique. We describe the clinical and physiological features of cortical myoclonus in ten children. Routine EEG, EEG backaveraging, SEP measurement, CT/MRI (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging), and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) were performed. All patients exhibited clear evidence of cortical myoclonus. In six patients, backaveraging was necessary since spikes were absent on routine EEG. A cortical source of the myoclonus was further supported by a TMS study performed on four patients. The etiologies of the myoclonus were diverse, cerebrovascular disease being the most common (three patients). Stimulus-sensitive or action-induced jerks were observed in three patients. Cortical SEPs were enlarged in one patient, and reduced or absent in six. Lesions were found on CT/MRI in nine patients, in five of whom the margin of the lesion was within, or adjacent to, the sensorimotor cortex.

This study describes the response of the diaphragm to paired transcranial magnetic stimulation. Thirteen normal subjects were studied (age range, 22 to 43 years; 7 men; phrenic conduction, <6.8 msec; latency of diaphragmatic motor evoked potential, <20.5 msec). Motor evoked potentials in response to paired stimulation were obtained in eight subjects only, with the motor threshold in the remaining five subjects too high to absorb the loss of power inherent in the double-stimulation montage. Interstimulus intervals less than 5 msec resulted in a statistically significant inhibition (p < 0.01 for interstimulus intervals of 1 and 3 ms), whereas intervals longer than 6 msec were facilitatory (maximal, 15 msec). The diaphragmatic pattern matched that of the biceps brachii. The authors conclude that it is possible to study intracortical inhibition and facilitation of diaphragmatic control, although not in all subjects.

The level of FDI EMG activity across tasks was kept constant by providing subjects with acoustic-visual feedback of their muscle activity. The TMS elicited larger amplitude FDI MEPs during pincer and power grip than during the index finger abduction task, and larger amplitude MEPs during pincer gripping than during power gripping. The CSP was shorter during pincer and power grip than during the index finger abduction task and shorter during power gripping than during pincer gripping. These results suggest excitatory and inhibitory task-dependent changes in the motor cortex. Complex manual tasks (pincer and power gripping) elicit greater motor cortical excitation than a simple task (index finger abduction) presumably because they activate multiple synergistic muscles thus facilitating corticomotoneurons. The finger abduction task probably yielded greater motor cortical inhibition than the pincer and power tasks because muscles uninvolved in the task activated the cortical inhibitory circuit.

However, this 'cross-over' of central fatigue between limbs is small and the location within the central nervous system at which this effect occurs is unknown. We investigated this 'cross-over' by measurement of the force and EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex (TMS). To produce central fatigue, we used sustained maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). In the first study, subjects (n=10) performed four 1-min sustained MVCs of the elbow flexors, alternating between the left and right arms (two MVCs per arm). The sustained MVCs were performed consecutively with no rest periods. In the second study, the same subjects made two sustained 1-min MVCs with the same arm with a 1-min rest between efforts. During each sustained MVC, a series of TMS and brachial plexus stimuli were delivered. Surface EMG was recorded from biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles bilaterally. Voluntary activation was estimated during each MVC using measurement of the force increments to TMS. On average during each sustained MVC, voluntary activation declined by 7-12% (absolute change, P<0.001) and voluntary force declined by 35-45% MVC (P<0.001), whereas the cortical motor-evoked potential increased (P<0.001) and the subsequent silent period lengthened (P<0.001). The average voluntary activation and voluntary force were similar during two sustained MVCs performed by the same arm, when separated by 1 min of rest. However, when the 1-min rest interval was replaced with a sustained contraction performed by the other arm, the average voluntary activation was 2.9% worse in the second contraction (absolute change, P<0.05), while it did not alter voluntary force production or the EMG responses to TMS. Therefore, in maximal exercise of 4 min duration, the 'cross-over' of central fatigue between limbs is small in the elbow flexors and has a minor functional effect.

In a control experiment, the size of the motor-evoked potentials elicited in the muscles of the right hand did not differ among conditions, suggesting that speech-related changes in excitability are specific to the lip muscles.

We studied whether sensory stimulation might induce changes in the strength of a specific spinal interneuronal circuit: spinally mediated reciprocal Ia inhibition. In healthy humans, the strength of reciprocal inhibition between ankle flexor and extensor muscles was assessed before and after 30 min of peroneal nerve stimulation at motor threshold intensity. Three stimulation protocols were assessed: patterned nerve stimulation (10 pulses at 100 Hz every 1.5 sec), uniform nerve stimulation (one pulse every 150 msec), and combined stimulation of the peroneal nerve and the motor cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Short-latency reciprocal inhibition from ankle flexor to extensor muscles was measured by conditioning the soleus H-reflex with stimulation of the common peroneal nerve. The strength of the reciprocal inhibition was measured at baseline and for 20 min after each stimulation session. Patterned stimulation, with or without motor cortex stimulation, enhanced reciprocal inhibition for at least 5 min afterward. The uniform pattern of stimulation was ineffective. These results demonstrate the presence of short-term plasticity within spinal inhibitory circuits. We conclude that the pattern of sensory input is a crucial factor for inducing changes in the spinal circuit for reciprocal inhibition in humans.

Lateral electrical stimulation of the motor cortex preferentially activates the axons of corticospinal neurones in the subcortical white matter, and evokes a D-wave in pyramidal tract. The way of activation of corticospinal neurones using magnetic stimulation depends on the direction of the electrical current induced in the brain and on the shape of the coil. Monophasic magnetic stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil inducing posterior-anterior current in the brain activates corticospinal neurones trans-synaptically recruiting an 11-wave, with later I-waves appearing in sequence at higher intensities and a D-wave at very high intensities. If the induced current is rotated to the anterior-posterior direction late I-waves are preferentially recruited and when a D-wave is recruited, it has a later onset than the electrical D-wave, suggesting an activation nearer the cell body of the pyramidal neurones. A latero-medial induced current activates both corticospinal axons at the same point as electrical stimulation evoking a D wave and cortico-cortical axons evoking I-waves. A nonfocal large circular coil centered at the vertex is capable of activating pyramidal neurones both at the initial segment and trans-synaptically evoking a D wave with a longer latency than the electrical D-wave and I-waves.

For example, in a situation where clinically unilateral facial weakness is observed, but facial nerve neurography demonstrates bilateral involvement, etiologies other than Bell's palsy are more likely, such as Lyme's disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningeal affections etc. Furthermore, the technique differentiates reliably between peripheral facial nerve lesion involving the segment in the brain stem or the segment after leaving the brainstem.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "A randomized controlled comparison of electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in severe and resistant nonpsychotic major depression.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "8414181", "authors": ["Grunhaus, L", "Schreiber, S", "Dolberg, OT", "Polak, D", "Dannon, PN"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "To study the influence of continuous high-frequency electrical stimulation with electrodes implanted in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) on motor cortex excitability in nine patients with dystonia.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "The combined dexamethasone-CRH test before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in major depression.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8469397", "authors": ["Zwanzger, P", "Baghai, TC", "Padberg, F", "Ella, R", "Minov, C", "Mikhaiel, P", "Sch\u00fcle, C", "Thoma, H", "Rupprecht, R"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Psychoneuroendocrinology", "abstract": "Short-term effects related to switching off and on the deep brain stimulator were investigated >3 months after electrode implantation.

During active training, subjects were instructed to perform voluntary wrist flexion-extension movements of a specified duration (target window 174-186 ms) in an articulated splint. Passive training consisted of wrist flexion- extension movements elicited by a torque motor, of the same amplitude and duration range as in the active task. fMRI activation and TMS parameters of motor cortex excitability were measured before and after each training type. Motor performance, measured as the number of movements that hit the target window duration, was significantly better after active than after passive training. Both active and passive movements performed during fMRI measurements activated cM1. Active training led to more prominent increases in (i) fMRI activation of cM1; (ii) recruitment curves (TMS); and (iii) intracortical facilitation (TMS) than passive training. Therefore, a short period of active motor training is more effective than passive motor training in eliciting performance improvements and cortical reorganization.

Following PAS, depression of TMS-evoked motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) was induced only when the median nerve stimulation preceded the TMS pulse by 10 ms, while enhancement of cortical excitability was induced using an interstimulus interval of 25 ms, suggesting an important role of the sequence of cortical events triggered by the two stimulation modalities. Experiments using F-wave studies and electrical brain stem stimulation indicated that the site of the plastic changes underlying the decrease of MEP amplitudes following PAS (10 ms) was within the motor cortex. MEP amplitudes remained depressed for approximately 90 min. The decrease of MEP amplitudes was blocked when PAS(10 ms) was performed under the influence of dextromethorphan, an N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist, or nimodipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antagonist. The physiological profile of the depression of human motor cortical excitability following PAS(10 ms) suggests long-term depression of synaptic efficacy to be involved.

Excitatory effects can be assessed by ipsilateral motor-evoked potentials (iMEPs). Inhibitory effects include an interruption of ipsilateral voluntary muscle activity known as the silent period (iSP) and a reduction in corticospinal excitability evoked by conditioning stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex (interhemispheric inhibition, IHI). Both iSP and IHI may be mediated by transcallosal pathways. Their relationship to the contralateral corticospinal projection and whether iSP and IHI represent the same phenomenon remain unclear. The neuronal population activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is highly dependent on the direction of the induced current in the brain. We examined the relationship among iMEP, iSP, IHI, and the contralateral corticospinal system by examining the effects of different stimulus intensities and current directions. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from both first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. The iSP in the right FDI muscle was obtained by right motor cortex stimulation during voluntary muscle contraction. IHI was examined by conditioning stimulation of the right motor cortex followed by test stimulation of the left motor cortex at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2-80 ms. The induced current directions tested in the right motor cortex were anterior medial (AM), posterior medial (PM), posterior lateral, and anterior lateral (AL). Contralateral MEPs (cMEPs) had the lowest threshold with the AM direction and the shortest latency with the PM direction. iMEPs were present in 8 of 10 subjects. Both iMEP and IHI did not show significant directional preference. iSP was observed in all subjects with the highest threshold for the AL direction and the longest duration for the AM direction. cMEP, iSP, and IHI all increased with stimulus intensity up to approximately 75% stimulator output. Target muscle activation decreased IHI at 8-ms ISI but had little effect on IHI at 40-ms ISI. iSP and IHI at 8-ms ISI did not correlate at any stimulus intensities and current directions tested, and factor analysis showed that they are explained by different factors. However, active IHI at 40-ms ISI was explained by the same factor as iSP. The different directional preference for cMEP compared with iMEP and IHI suggests that these ipsilateral effects are mediated by populations of cortical neurons that are different from those activating the corticospinal neurons. iSP and IHI do not represent the same phenomenon and should be considered complementary measures of ipsilateral inhibition.", "pages": "32-5"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Paired transcranial magnetic stimulation for the early diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9233846", "authors": ["Frasson, E", "Bertolasi, L", "Bertasi, V", "Fusina, S", "Bartolomei, L", "Vicentini, S", "Rizzuto, N", "Priori, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that intracortical inhibition (ICI) plays an important role in shaping the output from primary motor cortex (M1).

Conditioning TMS of the PM or of contralateral primary motor cortex (cM1) were tested as control conditions.

The amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle after paired TMS were measured and compared with those obtained after single-pulse TMS of the left M1 under the various experimental conditions. Conditioning TMS of the SMA in the paired-pulse paradigm selectively enhanced MEP amplitudes in the visual-emotional triggered movement condition, compared with single-pulse TMS of M1 alone or with paired TMS during presentation of neutral visual cues. On the other hand, conditioning TMS of the PM or cM1 did not differentially influence MEP amplitudes under visual-emotional triggered movement conditions. This pattern of effects was related to the intensity of the conditioning TMS over the SMA, being most evident with intensities ranging from 110% to 80% of motor threshold.

Scalp EEG responses to visual stimuli (flashed either to the left or to the right visual field) were recorded for 8 min in six healthy subjects (1) before, (2) immediately following, and (3) 20 min after left occipital rTMS (1 Hz, 10 min). The parameters aimed to reduce cortical excitability beyond the end of the TMS train. In addition, simple reaction times to visual stimulation were recorded (left or right hand in separate blocks). In all subjects, VID was significantly and prominently reduced by rTMS (P = 0.0001). In contrast, rTMS failed to modulate early VEP components (P1/N1). A moderate effect was found on a late VEP component close to manual response onset (P = 0.014) but this effect was in the opposite direction to the VID change. All changes were restricted to the targeted left occipital cortex. The effects were present only after right visual field stimulation when a right hand response was required, were associated with a behavioral effect, and had washed out 20 min after rTMS. We conclude that VID and early VEPs represent different aspects of cortical activation. The findings that rTMS did not change early VEPs and selectively affected VID and late VEPs in conditions where the visual input must be transferred intrahemispherically for visuomotor integration (right visual field/right hand) are suggestive of rTMS interference with higher-order visual functions beyond visual input.
