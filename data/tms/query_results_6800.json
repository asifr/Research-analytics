Trains of stimuli (at 5 Hz frequency, and suprathreshold intensity) progressively increase the size of muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, gabapentin, and topiramate on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the changes in motor threshold, MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in 23 patients with neuropathic pain before and after a 1-week course of treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, topiramate and placebo. None of the three antiepileptic drugs changed the resting or active magnetic and electrical motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment, but not placebo, abolished the normal rTMS-induced facilitation of MEPs, but left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. Our results suggest that carbamazepine, gabapentin and topiramate modulate intracortical excitability by acting selectively on excitatory interneurons.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "154", "title": "Interactions between inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the human motor cortex.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "14579004", "authors": ["Chen, R"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Several different excitatory and inhibitory systems in the human motor cortex can be tested by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). While considerable information is known about these different inhibitory and excitatory phenomena individually, how they are related to each other and how they interact is not well understood. Several recent studies have investigated the interactions between some of these circuits by applying them together. It has been found that short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) are mediated by different circuits. LICI appears to inhibit SICI, which may occur through presynaptic GABA(B) receptors. Interhemispheric inhibition elicited by stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex also inhibits SICI and may share inhibitory mechanisms with LICI. Long-interval afferent inhibition induced by median nerve stimulation inhibits LICI but does not interact with SICI. Based on these results, a model of interactions between different inhibitory systems that can be tested and refined in the future is proposed. Further studies of the interaction between different cortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits should improve our understanding of the functional organization of the motor cortex and allow better interpretation of abnormal findings in disease states. It may also be developed into a new way of studying the pathophysiology of diseases and the effects of intervention.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "154", "title": "Information processing in long delay memory-guided saccades: further insights from TMS.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "14578999", "authors": ["Nyffeler, T", "Pierrot-Deseilligny, C", "Pflugshaupt, T", "von Wartburg, R", "Hess, CW", "M\u00fcri, RM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We hypothesized that the pre-SMA might have a special role in initiating each chunk but not at other points during the sequence. Experiment 2 therefore examined the effect of 0.5-s, 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) directed over the pre-SMA. As hypothesized, performance was disrupted when rTMS was delivered over the pre-SMA at the beginning of the second chunk but not when it was delivered in the middle of a chunk. Contrary to the hypothesis, TMS did not disrupt sequence initiation. Experiments 3 and 4 examined whether the very first movement of a sequence could be disrupted under any circumstances. Pre-SMA TMS did disrupt the initiation of sequences but only when subjects had to switch between sequences and when the first movement of each sequence was not covertly instructed by a learned visuomotor association. In conjunction, the results suggest that for overlearned sequences the pre-SMA is primarily concerned with the initiation of a sequence or sequence chunk and the role of the pre-SMA in sequence initiation is only discerned when subjects must retrieve the sequence from memory as a superordinate set of movements without the aid of a visuomotor association.

In TMS with single or repetitive pulses, stimulus intensities in general are referred to the individual MT, although it is unclear whether MT also reflects the excitability of nonmotor cortical areas such as the visual cortex. Visual cortex excitability can be assessed by thresholds for eliciting phosphenes (phosphene threshold, PT) following TMS over the occipital cortex. The question of a different efficacy of TMS pulses in distinct cortical areas was approached by comparing motor and phosphene thresholds using single-pulse TMS applied to the primary motor and visual cortex. The aim of the study was to clarify, whether MT and PT correlate with each other and whether MT possibly serves as a reasonable measure for the excitability of the visual cortex. In 32 healthy volunteers, TMS with biphasic single pulses was applied over the motor and visual cortex with a figure of eight-shaped coil connected to a Dantec MagPro stimulator. MT and PT were individually measured (percent of maximal stimulator output). Mean PT (61.4+/-11.7%) was significantly higher than mean MT (39.4+/-5.9%) (p=0.01). MT and PT did not correlate significantly (r=0.29, p>0.1). These findings suggest that the MT does not reflect the excitability of the visual cortex. Regarding excitatory effects, the efficacy of TMS may be different over the motor and visual cortex, likely related to a different excitability of these cortical areas.

We confirmed that premotor rTMS at 1 Hz and an intensity of 90% active motor threshold (AMT) produced a lasting decrease in corticospinal excitability probed with single-pulse TMS over the left M1(HAND). Reducing the intensity to 80% AMT increased paired-pulse excitability at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 7 ms.

No effects were seen if rTMS was applied at the same intensities to prefrontal or primary motor cortices. These findings indicate that the intensity of premotor rTMS determines the net effect of conditioning on distinct populations of neurones in the ipsilateral M1(HAND), but it is the frequency of rTMS that determines the direction of the induced change.

However, there is emerging evidence that linguistic tasks may alter excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways also. In this study we evaluated the effect of several movement-free, low-level linguistic processes involved in reading and writing on the excitability of the bilateral corticospinal motor pathways in a group of right-handed subjects. The study included two series of tasks, visual searching/matching and imaginal writing/drawing. The tasks were designed to roughly correspond with elemental aspects of the reading and writing, grapheme recognition and grapheme generation, respectively. Each task series included separate blocks with different task targets: letters, digits, semantically easy-to-code (i.e. geometric) shapes, and semantically hard-to-code shapes, as well as control blocks with no task. During task performance, TMS was delivered randomly over the hand area of either the left or right motor cortex and the modulation of the excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways was measured bilaterally through changes of the size of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) induced in the relaxed right and left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. We found that the size of the MEP in hand muscles increased during visual searching/matching tasks, particularly when targets were letters or geometric shapes, and the increase was significant for the dominant hand (left hemisphere) only. No such consistent effects were seen across subjects during imaginal tasks. This study provides evidence that even the performance of certain low-level linguistic tasks can modulate the excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways, particularly those originating from the left (dominant) hemisphere, despite the absence of overt motor activity. Moreover, in the light of the recently increased awareness of the role of \"mirror neurons\" in perception, the results suggest that activation of motor circuits used in generation of the written output may be an essential part of the perception of the written material as well. Understanding the patterns of task-dependent changes in excitability of the corticospinal motor pathways will provide insights into the organisation of central nervous system functional networks involved in linguistic processes, and may also be useful for future development of novel approaches to rehabilitation therapy of linguistic and motor functions.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional imaging in cognitive brain research: possibilities and limitations.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10841985", "authors": ["Sack, AT", "Linden, DE"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Brain research.

Responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation [motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)], stimulation of the descending tracts [cervicomedullary MEPs (CMEPs)], and peripheral nerve stimulation (H-reflex) were recorded from the relaxed right flexor carpi radialis (FCR), while the left arm underwent unilateral interventions (5 s duration) that included voluntary contraction, muscle contraction evoked through percutaneous stimulation, tendon vibration, and cutaneous and mixed nerve stimulation. During moderate to strong voluntary wrist flexion on the left, MEPs in the right FCR increased, CMEPs were unaffected, and the H-reflex was depressed. These results are consistent with an increase in excitability of the motor cortex, no effect on the motoneuron pool, and presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. In contrast, percutaneous muscle stimulation facilitated both MEPs and the H-reflex. However, muscle contraction produced by a combination of voluntary effort and electrical stimulation also reduced the contralateral H-reflex. After voluntary contractions, the H-reflex remained depressed for 35 s, but after stimulation-evoked contractions, it rapidly returned to baseline. Under both conditions, MEPs recovered rapidly. After voluntary contractions, CMEPs were also depressed for approximately 10 s despite their lack of change during contractions. Wrist tendon vibration (100 Hz) did not affect, and 20-Hz median nerve stimulation or forearm medial cutaneous nerve stimulation mildly facilitated, the H-reflex without affecting MEPs. Voluntary wrist extension, similarly to wrist flexion, increased MEPs and depressed H-reflexes. However, ankle dorsiflexion facilitated the H-reflex akin to the Jendrassik maneuver.

We hypothesized that, if activity in the intact hemisphere contributes to functional recovery, TMS should result in abnormal motor behavior in the paretic hand. We found that stimulation of the intact hemisphere resulted in delayed simple reaction times (RTs) in the contralateral healthy but not in the ipsilateral paretic hand, whereas stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere led to a marked delay in RT in the contralateral paretic hand but not in the ipsilateral healthy hand. RT delays in the paretic hand correlated well with functional recovery. Finger tapping in the paretic hand was affected by TMS of the lesioned but not the intact hemisphere.

Twenty patients with cirrhosis underwent neuropsychologic tests, neurophysiologic study of the cortico-spinal tract with transcranial magnetic stimulation, and (1)H-magnetic resonance. The study was repeated 6 months after liver transplantation (n = 15) and was compared with a control group of healthy subjects (n = 11).

In conclusion, T2 hyperintensity along the cortico-spinal tract in cirrhosis relates to functional abnormalities that are reversible after liver transplantation.

Studies from recent years show that TMS affects mood in healthy subjects and improves depressive symptoms in patients with major depression. However, the relationship between the clinical efficacy of TMS and stimulation parameters is still obscure. In the present study we have investigated the effects of different stimulation frequencies and number of treatments on catecholamine turnover in SH-SY5Y cell cultures. A single session of magnetic stimulation (1.7 T) caused a significant decrease in intracellular dopamine and L-DOPA and in noradrenaline (NE) release at a rate of 3 Hz for 10 s but increased NE release at a rate of 9 Hz. These alterations were associated with a reduction (47.8%) or an increase (48%) in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity after 3 and 9 Hz magnetic stimulation, respectively. The latter may be related to the known sensitivity of TH to neuronal firing rates and NE concentrations. Higher stimulation frequencies (15, 20, 45 Hz) had no effect on catecholamine metabolism. Unlike 3 Hz acute treatment, chronic treatment (3 Hz, 11 sessions, for 4 d) had no effect on monoamines and TH activity was increased by 54.5% with no change in its protein level. The results of the present study demonstrate that in tissue culture system frequency and treatment duration of the magnetic stimulation are important factors in affecting catecholamine turnover.

The effect of single biphasic TMS pulses, which induce a lateral-to-medial electric current within the occipital pole of the right hemisphere, was tested for spontaneous as well as visually evoked activity. For cat visual cortex we found that a single TMS pulse elicited distinct episodes of enhanced and suppressed activity: in general, a facilitation of activity was found during the first 500 ms, followed thereafter by a suppression of activity lasting up to a few seconds. Strong stimuli exceeding 50 % of maximal stimulator output could also lead to an early suppression of activity during the first 100-200 ms, followed by stronger (rebound) facilitation. Early suppression and facilitation of activity may be related to a more or less direct stimulation of inhibitory and excitatory interneurons, probably with different thresholds. The late, long-lasting suppression is more likely to be related to metabotropic or metabolic processes, or even vascular responses.

In addition, the combined use of these EPs in each patients, so-called multimodality EPs, enables us to evaluate multiple aspects of sensory and motor systems. In 73 Japanese MS, the abnormality rates were 10.3% in median nerve SSEP, 37.1% in posterior tibial nerve SSEP, 35.6% in upper limb MEP, 56.1% in lower limb MEP, 39.3% in PVEP and 34.3% in BAEP. The frequency of clinically unsuspected lesions was about 30% in each EP. These findings are in good agreement with the recent fact that conventional MS have been increased in Japan. Other electrophysiological methods such as multimodality VEPs, pain-related SEPs, paired TMS and event related potentials(P300) may be useful for the diagnosis or evaluation of MS.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "152", "title": "Investigating human motor control by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9842761", "authors": ["Petersen, NT", "Pyndt, HS", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

We hypothesized that a fall in the diaphragm and quadriceps motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex would occur after an incremental exercise task. In 11 healthy subjects, we measured transdiaphragmatic pressure and isometric quadriceps tension in response to supramaximal peripheral magnetic nerve stimulation. MEPs were recorded from these muscles in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. After baseline measurements, subjects performed a period of submaximal exercise (gentle walking). Measurements were repeated 5 and 20 min after this. The subjects then exercised on a treadmill with an incremental protocol to exhaustion. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed at baseline and at 5, 20, 40, and 60 min after exhaustive exercise, and force measurements were obtained at baseline, 20 min, and 60 min. Mean exercise duration was 18 +/- 4 min, and mean maximum heart rate was 172 +/- 10 beats/min. Twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure and twitch isometric quadriceps tension were not different from baseline after exercise, but a significant decrease was observed in diaphragm MEP amplitude 5 and 20 min after exercise (60 +/- 38 and 45 +/- 24%, respectively, of baseline, P = 0.0001). At the same times, the mean quadriceps MEPs were 59 +/- 39 and 74 +/- 32% of baseline (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Studies using paired stimuli confirmed a likely intracortical mechanism for this depression. Our data confirm significant depression of both diaphragm and quadriceps MEPs after incremental treadmill exercise.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Mathematical phenomenology of neural stimulation by periodic fields.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9882756", "authors": ["Balduzzo, M", "Milone, FF", "Minelli, TA", "Pittaro-Cadore, I", "Turicchia, L"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Nonlinear dynamics, psychology, and life sciences", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) were used for the investigation of cortical excitability preceding voluntary movement in human subjects. The study showed the practical value of the combined TMS-EEG approach in differentiating between cortical and spinal-cord mechanisms, which is difficult with conventional electromyographic measures alone. TMS induced a pronounced negativity (N100) lasting for 150-200 ms, with the amplitude maximum in the stimulated hemisphere. When TMS was applied just before the onset of the visually triggered movement, N100 was markedly attenuated, although motor evoked potentials (MEPs) became larger. We suggest that the N100 component represents an inhibitory response following TMS. This interpretation is in agreement with intracellular recordings in animals, paired-pulse TMS studies and experiments showing increased premovement excitability on the basis of MEPs. N100 was not affected only by the subsequent movement, but also by the switching from rest to the motor-task condition, which caused a slight attenuation of the N100 component; no changes, however, were found in the amplitude of MEPs, suggesting that modified excitability did not affect the output of the corticospinal pyramidal cells. By contrast to MEPs, N100 was modulated also by the presentation of the visual stimulus alone, i.e. when no movement was required. This attenuation suggests that even in a rest condition visual stimuli have an access to the sensorimotor regions of the cortex, most probably through ascending arousal brain systems.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Increased visual cortical excitability in ecstasy users: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "10574382", "authors": ["Oliveri, M", "Calvo, G"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The maximum voluntary muscle force can vary throughout the day; typically being low in the morning and high in the evening. The nature of this possible variation has been investigated with respect to corticospinal excitability. Six healthy subjects were studied. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in the thenar muscles was measured. In addition, we monitored several indices of corticospinal excitability using electromyographic (EMG) recording and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded while relaxed and at 10% MVC when the silent period was assessed as an index of corticospinal inhibition. Readings were taken every 3 h for 24 h. MVC of the thenar muscles did not change significantly over the 24 h. The mean areas, latencies and durations of MEPs did not show significant changes over the 24-h test period with the muscle relaxed or contracted; however, MEP area did vary between sessions at all stimulus intensities suggesting non-time-of-day-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability. Furthermore, the extent and duration of the silent period seen after the MEP in the contracted muscle did not change significantly over the 24 h of the experiment at any stimulus intensity. These results provide evidence that the MVC force of the thenar muscles and their responses to TMS are stable throughout the course of the day and suggest that, in hand muscles, corticospinal excitability may not be subject to circadian variation.", "pages": "488-93"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Motor system abnormalities in hereditary spastic paraparesis type 4 (SPG4) depend on the type of mutation in the spastin gene.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "10656513", "authors": ["B\u00f6nsch, D", "Schwindt, A", "Navratil, P", "Palm, D", "Neumann, C", "Klimpe, S", "Schickel, J", "Hazan, J", "Weiller, C", "Deufel, T", "Liepert, J"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to assess reorganization in the motor cortex of patients with lower limb amputation. We studied seven patients with traumatic lower limb amputation, and six healthy controls, using transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping, with recordings from the quadriceps femoris muscle on both sides.

We found a significant lateral displacement of the COG on the hemisphere contralateral to the healthy leg, whereas other parameters did not differ significantly between sides. This finding might be indicative of cortical reorganization in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the amputation.
