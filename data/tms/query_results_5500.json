We administered 50 single pulses of TMS, at an intensity of 120% of resting motor threshold, over the left and right primary motor cortex and, at the same time, recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) using a 60-electrode cap. We were able to perform analyses on seven EEG data sets and found that stimulation of the unoperated hemisphere (with thalamus) resulted in higher amplitudes of the single-trial induced beta oscillations than in the operated hemisphere (with thalamotomy). The beta oscillation obtained in response to pulses applied over the unoperated hemisphere was also higher than that obtained in healthy controls. We suggest that (1) the beta oscillatory response to pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex is higher in Parkinson's disease patients, (2) thalamotomy serves to reduce the abnormally high TMS-induced beta oscillations, and (3) the motor thalamus facilitates the cortically generated oscillation, through cortico-subcortico-cortical feedback loops.", "pages": "837-45"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "On the functional role of human parietal cortex in number processing: How gender mediates the impact of a 'virtual lesion' induced by rTMS.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "16828812", "authors": ["Knops, A", "Nuerk, HC", "Sparing, R", "Foltys, H", "Willmes, K"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Areas around the horizontal part of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) have repeatedly been reported to participate in processing numerical magnitude.

While the midbrain dopaminergic system is crucial for acute reward and the initiation of addiction, evidence suggests that there are permanent neuronal changes at the cellular and molecular levels that underlie the addictive process. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic factor family and the most abundant neurotrophins in the brain, plays a key role in the survival and differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Evidence from animal and clinical studies suggests that increased central BDNF activity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of drug addiction. For example, BDNF infusion into rat midbrain enhances the rewarding effects of cocaine as measured by the condition place preference paradigm. In contrast, cocaine-conditioned place preference was reduced in heterozygous BDNF knockout mice. In humans, the 66Val allele of the BDNF-gene Val66Met polymorphism is associated with higher BDNF secretion in response to neuronal stimulation compared with the 66Met allele. We found higher BDNF 66Val homozygote frequency in people with drug addiction compared with normal controls. Furthermore, plasma BDNF concentrations of methamphetamine users were significantly higher than controls. The increased central BDNF activity hypothesis of drug addiction may provide new insights for improved therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of drug addiction.

In the ECR muscle, reverse results were observed. At comparable EMG levels of the FDI muscle MEPs were the same during intended and non-intended muscle contractions. After practice, MEPs during intended muscle contraction became larger than those during non-intended at 10% MVC force level, while EMGs were the same between two muscle contractions. It is concluded that motor strategies and excitability changes of hand motor area are different during intended and non-intended muscle contractions, and these differences are due to the different voluntary drives of intended and non-intended.

Inhibition is mediated through a diversity of different interneurones and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes. Here we employed paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), a GABA(A)R-mediated inhibition in human motor cortex, to address the question of which GABA(A)R subtype is responsible for this form of inhibition. It has been shown that classical benzodiazepines (diazepam and lorazepam) have a non-selective affinity profile at different alpha-subunit-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A)R while zolpidem has a 10-fold greater affinity to the alpha1-subunit-bearing GABA(A)R compared with those bearing the alpha2- or alpha3-subunit. We found that, in seven healthy subjects, a single oral dose of 20 mg of diazepam or 2.5 mg of lorazepam significantly increased SICI, whereas 10 mg of zolpidem did not change SICI. This dissociation occurred despite equal sedation by all three drugs, an alpha1-subunit GABA(A)R-mediated effect. The findings strongly suggest that SICI is not mediated by the alpha1-subunit-bearing subtype of the GABA(A)R but by those bearing either the alpha2- or alpha3-subunit. This study represents an attempt by means of TMS to identify GABA(A)R subtype-specific action at the systems level of human cortex, a highly relevant issue because the different alpha-subunit-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A)R are differently involved in benzodiazepine-mediated effects such as sedation, amnesia or anxiolysis, in developmental cortical plasticity, and in neurological disorders such as epilepsy.", "pages": "837-45"}, {"volume": "201", "title": "Magnetically evoked inter-enlargement response: an assessment of ascending propriospinal fibers following spinal cord injury.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10590941", "authors": ["Beaumont, E", "Onifer, SM", "Reed, WR", "Magnuson, DS"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Rehabilitation can induce cortical reorganization in chronic stroke patients.

Following a complete lateral hemisection, MIERs were present in the triceps bilaterally following stimulation of either hip. Responses could also be recorded from the masseter muscles indicating that the influence of this pathway extends beyond the spinal cord.

We combined low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation and positron emission tomography to study the age-related changes in regional activation and effective connectivity, associated with voluntary action by healthy adults between 22 and 68 years old. Contrasting effects of aging on the motor network were seen using analyses of regional activation, effective connectivity mediating task-related neuronal activation and effective connectivity in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Low-frequency rTMS reduced cerebral blood flow during both movement and resting conditions, at the site of stimulation and neighboring frontal cortex. Aging was associated with increased movement-related activation in premotor cortex, bilaterally. Increasing age also increased the susceptibility of the cortex to the inhibitory effects of rTMS, at the site of stimulation and its contralateral homologue. Moreover, older subjects showed enhanced local effective connectivity, centered on the left premotor cortex, but reduced effective connectivity between distant motor-related cortical areas. We discuss these results in relation to the HAROLD model of aging and propose that there are differential effects of aging on local and distributed neuronal subpopulations in the motor network.

Little is known about the exact functional organization of this \"non-mirror transformation\" network. Involvement of the right dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) was suggested because its virtual lesion by high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) increased the excitability of the left primary motor cortex (M1) during unilateral isometric contraction of a left hand muscle (Cincotta et al., Neurosci Lett 367: 189-93, 2004). However, no behavioural effects were observed in that experimental protocol. Here we tested behaviourally twelve healthy volunteers to find out whether focal disruption of the right dPMC by \"off-line\" One Hz rTMS (900 pulses, 115% of resting motor threshold) enhances \"physiological\" mirroring. This was measured by an established protocol (Mayston et al., Ann Neurol 45: 583-94, 1999) that quantifies the mirror increase in the electromyographic (EMG) level in the isometrically contracting abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle of one hand during brief phasic contractions performed with the APB of the other hand. Mirroring in the right APB significantly increased after real rTMS of the right dPMC. In contrast, no change in mirroring was seen with sham rTMS of the right dPMC, real rTMS of the right M1, or real rTMS of the left dPMC.

Several mechanisms of actions detected in vivo/in vitro including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonism, blockage of potassium channels, dopamine receptor agonism, enhancement of noradrenergic release, and anticholinergic effects have been described. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evaluate the effect of single doses of amantadine on human motor cortex excitability in normal subjects. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design, motor thresholds, recruitment curves, cortical stimulation-induced silent period (CSP), short intracortical inhibition (ICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and late inhibition (L-ICI) in 14 healthy subjects were investigated after oral doses of 50 and 100 mg amantadine with single and paired pulse TMS paradigms. Spinal cord excitability was investigated by distal latencies and M-amplitudes of the abductor digiti minimi muscle. After intake of amantadine, a significant dose-dependent decrease of ICF was noticed as well as a significant increase of L-ICI as compared to placebo. The effect on ICF and L-ICI significantly correlated with amantadine serum levels. ICI was slightly increased after amantadine intake, but the effect failed to be significant. Furthermore, amantadine had no significant effects on motor thresholds, MEP recruitment curves, CSP, or peripheral excitability. In conclusion, a low dose of amantadine is sufficient in modulating human motor cortex excitability. The decrease of ICF and increase of L-ICI may reflect glutamatergic modulation or a polysynaptic interaction of glutamatergic and GABA-ergic circuits. Although amantadine has several mechanisms of action, the NMDA-receptor antagonism seems to be the most relevant effect on cortical excitability. As L-ICI can be influenced by this type of drug, it may be an interesting parameter for studies of motor learning and use-dependent plasticity.", "pages": "837-45"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "The role of the right superior temporal gyrus in visual search-insights from intraoperative electrical stimulation.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "11752090", "authors": ["Gharabaghi, A", "Fruhmann Berger, M", "Tatagiba, M", "Karnath, HO"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "The active force generated by a single muscle fiber is greatest in midrange.

It is unknown whether this effect also occurs with postural contractions. We have compared the effects of voluntary and postural contractions on SICI in the soleus (SOL) muscle. We applied transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) in subjects under three tasks: sitting at rest (Rest), sitting while activating the SOL muscle (Voluntary), or standing quietly (Postural). In control trials, we applied suprathreshold TMS to obtain unconditioned motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). In test trials, the same TMS was preceded by a subthreshold TMS at different interstimulus intervals (ISIs), to obtain a conditioned MEP. SICI and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were expressed as the decrease or increase in MEP size relative to unconditioned MEPs. There was significant effect of task in mean SICI or mean ICF in SOL. Mean SICI in SOL was 52% in Rest and decreased to 21% in Voluntary and 15% in Postural. Mean ICF in SOL was 132% and decreased to 113% in Voluntary and to 108% in Postural. Mean SICI in SOL was not different in Voluntary and Postural tasks. There was no effect of task in mean SICI or mean ICF in TA. Our results indicate that decrease of SICI with muscle contraction occurs to a similar extent with tonic voluntary and postural activation, suggesting that those contractions require a similar type of cortical involvement. However, it cannot be excluded that some part of the SICI reduction with muscle contraction depends on changes in segmental excitability.", "pages": "837-45"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "The role of prefrontal cortex in visuo-spatial planning: A repetitive TMS study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10802448", "authors": ["Basso, D", "Lotze, M", "Vitale, L", "Ferreri, F", "Bisiacchi, P", "Olivetti Belardinelli, M", "Rossini, PM", "Birbaumer, N"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Using low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and a paradigm involving color-naming latencies for angry, fearful and neutral faces, and for emotional and neutral words respectively, we found evidence for a hemispheric specialization according to the sex and emotional content of faces in female subjects. Participants showed increased attention specifically to male angry faces after stimulation of the right superior temporal lobe, whereas they showed increased attention to angry female faces after left temporal stimulation. No effect was detected regarding the processing of fearful faces or emotional words. This result suggests differential processing of sex-specific threat-related stimuli specifically involving both hemispheres, i.e., that male and female faces are processed in opposite hemispheres, which might reflect the divergent adaptive significance of male and female threat for young females.", "pages": "837-45"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Asymmetrical facilitation of motor-evoked potentials following motor practice.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "16799350", "authors": ["Hammond, GR", "Vallence, AM"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "We investigated the properties of the neural response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the human primary motor cortex. Consistent with our previous findings, single pulses of TMS induce a characteristic negative deflection at 45 ms (N45) and a transient oscillation in the beta frequency-range (15-30 Hz), as measured using electroencephalograpy (EEG). Here we show the relative specificity of the beta oscillation and the N45; both are stronger when elicited by stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex, as compared with stimulation over the dorsal premotor cortex. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the beta responses to single pulses of TMS and show that the responses are highly phaselocked to the TMS pulses within single subjects; this phaselocking is similar from subject to subject. A single pulse of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex thus appears to reset the ongoing oscillations of the neurons, bringing them transiently into synchrony. Finally, we examine the effect of local or distal modulation of the excitability of the primary motor cortex on the beta oscillation and the N45 in response to single-pulse TMS. We applied low-frequency subthreshold repetitive TMS either over the primary motor cortex (local modulation) or, on a separate day, over the dorsal premotor cortex (distal modulation). The modulation was evaluated with single suprathreshold test pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex before and after the subthreshold low-frequency rTMS. We recorded the EEG response throughout the testing session, i.e. to both the subthreshold and the suprathreshold pulses. After repetitive TMS applied over the primary motor cortex, but not the dorsal premotor cortex, the amplitude of the N45 in response to suprathreshold pulses tended to decrease (not significant), and subsequently increased (significant); neither type of repetitive TMS affected the amplitude of the beta oscillation. We conclude that (1) the N45 depends on circuits intrinsic to the primary motor cortex; (2) the beta oscillation is specific to stimulation of the primary motor cortex, but is not affected by modulation of either cortical area and; (3) the beta oscillatory response to pulses of TMS arises from resetting of ongoing oscillations rather than their induction.", "pages": "837-45"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Motor facilitation during action observation: topographic mapping of the target muscle and influence of the onlooker's posture.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "16798081", "authors": ["Urgesi, C", "Candidi, M", "Fabbro, F", "Romani, M", "Aglioti, SM"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute and long-term effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on focal epileptiform interictal EEG activity in a patient with fixation-off sensitivity and partial epilepsy.

In spite of this there is a progressive reduction in voluntary motor drive, as shown by an increase in the interpolated twitch force as fatigue develops. The aim of this study was to determine whether, by further increasing corticomotor excitability using a paired-pulse rTMS protocol designed to induce I-wave facilitation (iTMS), force loss during a sustained voluntary contraction could be reduced. We designed a cross-over study incorporating a 15-min period of iTMS (ISI 1.5 ms; 0.2 Hz; approximately AMT), following which MEP amplitude (first dorsal interosseous muscle) increased to 194 +/- 38% of baseline (P < 0.05), compared to a control period of stimulation that did not increase MEP amplitude (single-pulse TMS; 0.2 Hz; approximately 1.2 AMT). Eight right-handed healthy subjects received both iTMS and control stimulation, in a randomized order, a week apart. We measured percentage force loss at the end of a 10-s maximum right hand key-pinch task, and compared force loss before and after stimulation. There was an improvement in task performance following iTMS, with a reduction in force loss compared to pre-stimulation baseline (11.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 17.6 +/- 2.4%; post vs. pre; P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in force loss before and after control stimulation. The results indicate that by increasing corticomotor excitability using paired-pulse rTMS at trans-synaptic intervals, maximum voluntary force can be sustained at a higher level during a brief fatiguing maximal voluntary contraction.", "pages": "837-45"}]
