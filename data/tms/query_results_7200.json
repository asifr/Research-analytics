In order to determine whether the neural adaptations to resistance training occur to a greater extent at cortical or subcortical sites in the CNS, we compared the effects of resistance training on the electromyographic (EMG) responses to transcranial magnetic (TMS) and electrical (TES) stimulation. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 16 individuals before and after 4 weeks of resistance training for the index finger abductors (n = 8), or training involving finger abduction-adduction without external resistance (n = 8). TMS was delivered at rest at intensities from 5 % below the passive threshold to the maximal output of the stimulator. TMS and TES were also delivered at the active threshold intensity while the participants exerted torques ranging from 5 to 60 % of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque. The average latency of MEPs elicited by TES was significantly shorter than that of TMS MEPs (TES latency = 21.5 +/- 1.4 ms; TMS latency = 23.4 +/- 1.4 ms; P < 0.05), which indicates that the site of activation differed between the two forms of stimulation. Training resulted in a significant increase in MVC torque for the resistance-training group, but not the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in the corticospinal properties measured at rest for either group. For the active trials involving both TMS and TES, however, the slope of the relationship between MEP size and the torque exerted was significantly lower after training for the resistance-training group (P < 0.05). Thus, for a specific level of muscle activity, the magnitude of the EMG responses to both forms of transcranial stimulation were smaller following resistance training. These results suggest that resistance training changes the functional properties of spinal cord circuitry in humans, but does not substantially affect the organisation of the motor cortex.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "544", "title": "Effects of peripheral sensory input on cortical inhibition in humans.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "11336912", "authors": ["Sailer, A", "Molnar, GF", "Cunic, DI", "Chen, R"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Normal coordinated movement requires that the activity of antagonistic motoneurones may be depressed at appropriate times during the movement. Both glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms participate in this control. Patients with the major form of hyperekplexia (hereditary startle disease) have impaired inhibition of spinal motoneurones from local glycinergic interneurones and represent an ideal opportunity for studying the role of glycinergic inhibition in the control of antagonistic muscles. In the present study we investigated whether impaired glycinergic inhibition affects the corticospinal control of antagonistic spinal motoneurones in 10 patients with hyperekplexia and whether there are mechanisms that may compensate for the lack of glycinergic inhibition. In healthy subjects transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produced a short-latency inhibition of the soleus H-reflex at rest and during tonic dorsiflexion. This inhibition, which has been shown to be mediated by spinal (glycinergic) inhibitory interneurones, was absent in all four patients in whom this experiment was performed. This confirms that glycinergic transmission is impaired in the patients. During voluntary dorsiflexion subthreshold TMS produced a depression of the ongoing EMG activity in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in both healthy subjects and all of the six tested patients. This is consistent with the idea that this EMG depression is caused by activation of cortical (GABAergic) inhibitory interneurones. Cross-correlation analysis revealed normal short-term synchronization of TA motor units accompanied by coherence in the 8-12 Hz and 18-35 Hz frequency bands in the 10 patients. As in healthy subjects, 8-12 Hz coherence accompanied by decreased tendency to discharge synchronously (de-synchronization) was found in recordings from the antagonistic TA and soleus muscles in 2 of the 10 patients. This suggests that glycinergic inhibition is not responsible for de-synchronization of antagonistic motor units, but that other GABAergic-inhibitory mechanisms must be involved. We propose that such mechanisms may compensate for the lack of glycinergic reciprocal inhibition in the hyperekplectic patients and explain why voluntary movements are not more severely affected.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Eye-hand interactions differ in the human premotor and parietal cortices.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "7965025", "authors": ["van Donkelaar, P", "Lee, JH", "Drew, AS"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Human movement science", "abstract": "Cortical inhibitory systems play an important role in motor output. The motor cortex can be inhibited by intracortical mechanisms and by peripheral sensory inputs. We examined whether cortical inhibition from peripheral sensory input is mediated through previously identified intracortical inhibitory systems and how these inhibitory systems interact. Two types of intracortical inhibition were assessed by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was determined with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (CS) followed by a test stimulus 2 ms later and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) with suprathreshold conditioning and test stimuli 100 ms apart. Cortical inhibition from peripheral sensory input was induced by median nerve stimulation (MNS) of the right hand and followed by a suprathreshold TMS over the left motor cortex 200 ms later. The first set of experiments tested the effects of different test stimulus intensities on SICI, LICI and cortical inhibition induced by median nerve stimulation (MNSI). With higher test stimulus intensities, LICI and MNSI decreased whereas SICI showed a trend towards an increase. The extent of SICI, LICI and MNSI did not correlate. The second experiment assessed the interaction between MNSI and LICI. The results of applying MNSI and LICI simultaneously were compared with MNSI and LICI alone. MNSI was virtually abolished in the presence of LICI and LICI was also significantly decreased in the presence of MNSI. Thus, the effects of MNSI and LICI when applied together were much less than their expected additive effects when applied alone. The degree of interaction between MNSI and LICI was related to the combined strength of MNSI and LICI but not to the strength of LICI alone. The third experiment investigated the interaction between SICI and MNSI. MNSI and SICI were applied together and the results were compared with MNSI and SICI alone. SICI remained unchanged in the presence of MNSI. We conclude that MNSI is mediated by circuits distinct from those mediating LICI or SICI. The MNSI circuits seem to have an inhibitory interaction with the LICI circuits, whereas the SICI and MNSI circuits do not seem to interact.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in major depression: relation between efficacy and stimulation intensity.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10873519", "authors": ["Padberg, F", "Zwanzger, P", "Keck, ME", "Kathmann, N", "Mikhaiel, P", "Ella, R", "Rupprecht, P", "Thoma, H", "Hampel, H", "Toschi, N", "M\u00f6ller, HJ"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "In order to successfully look at and reach for a visual target the central nervous system must perform a complex sensorimotor transformation.

For this purpose, we made use of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt the processing occurring in the PMC during task performance. Subjects made open-loop pointing movements accompanied by saccades of the same size or two or three times larger. Under normal circumstances without TMS, the pointing movement amplitude increased with saccade amplitude. When TMS was applied over the PMC 100-200 ms after target presentation, the influence of saccade amplitude on the pointing movement amplitude was increased. This is the opposite effect to that observed in a previous study [Journal of Neurophysiology 84 (200) 1677-1680] when TMS was applied over the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) during the same task.

TMS had a greater effect on patients than controls in a manner that depended on the site, hemisphere, and time of stimulation. In patients with right hemiparesis (but not in healthy controls), TMS applied to PMd early (100 ms) after the cue to move slowed simple reaction-time finger movements by 12% compared with controls. The relative slowing of movements with ipsilateral PMd stimulation in patients correlated with the degree of motor impairment, suggesting that functional recruitment of ipsilateral motor areas was greatest in the more impaired patients. We also used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor brain activity in these subjects as they performed the same movements. Slowing of reaction time after premotor cortex TMS in the patients correlated inversely with the relative hemispheric lateralization of functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in PMd.

Their performance was significantly disrupted when we delivered a pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the contralateral SI early (300 or 600 msec) in the retention interval. TMS did not affect tactile working memory if delivered to contralateral SI late in the retention interval (at 900 or 1200 msec), nor did TMS affect performance if delivered to the ipsilateral SI at any time point.

To reveal the underlying mechanisms of direct current (DC)-induced neuroplasticity, we combined tDCS of the motor cortex with the application of Na(+)-channel-blocking carbamazepine (CBZ) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist dextromethorphan (DMO). Monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), motor cortical excitability changes of up to 40% were achieved in the drug-free condition. Increase of cortical excitability could be selected by anodal stimulation, and decrease by cathodal stimulation. Both types of excitability change lasted several minutes after cessation of current stimulation. DMO suppressed the post-stimulation effects of both anodal and cathodal DC stimulation, strongly suggesting the involvement of NMDA receptors in both types of DC-induced neuroplasticity. In contrast, CBZ selectively eliminated anodal effects. Since CBZ stabilizes the membrane potential voltage-dependently, the results reveal that after-effects of anodal tDCS require a depolarization of membrane potentials. Similar to the induction of established types of short- or long-term neuroplasticity, a combination of glutamatergic and membrane mechanisms is necessary to induce the after-effects of tDCS. On the basis of these results, we suggest that polarity-driven alterations of resting membrane potentials represent the crucial mechanisms of the DC-induced after-effects, leading to both an alteration of spontaneous discharge rates and to a change in NMDA-receptor activation.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Partial return of motor function in paralyzed legs after surgical bypass of the lesion site by nerve autografts three years after spinal cord injury.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "10420021", "authors": ["Tadie, M", "Liu, S", "Robert, R", "Guiheneuc, P", "Pereon, Y", "Perrouin-Verbe, B", "Mathe, JF"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "abstract": "Reorganization after early brain injuries is not only determined by the maturational stage of the CNS at the time of the insult (timing), but also by the structural properties, location and extent of the lesion.

Twelve young adult patients with congenital hemiparesis and 10 age-matched controls were studied. The severity of structural damage to hand motor projections of the cortico-spinal tract was assessed on semi-coronal MRI reconstructions along anatomical landmarks of cortico-spinal tract somatotopy. The functional integrity of these crossed cortico-spinal projections in the affected hemisphere, as well as the presence of any abnormal ipsilateral projections to the paretic hand, was examined by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Cortical activation during simple voluntary hand movements was studied by functional MRI (fMRI). Patients with small lesions (SL; n = 4) and only mild hand motor impairment possessed intact crossed cortico-spinal projections to the paretic hand, whereas no motor response could be elicited by TMS of the affected hemisphere in those with large lesions (LL; n = 6) and more severe hand motor impairment. Evidence for compensatory recruitment of the unaffected hemisphere was found in both subgroups. In the SL group, fMRI demonstrated ipsilateral activation of premotor areas, without any abnormal projections to the paretic hand originating from these sites. In the LL group, such abnormal ipsilateral projections to the paretic hand were indeed found, and fMRI confirmed cortical activation of an abnormal ipsilateral hand motor representation in the primary sensorimotor region of the unaffected hemisphere. Two patients with intermediate-sized lesions presented combined features of both groups (SL, LL). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the type of cortico-spinal reorganization depends on the extent of the brain lesion. We propose that involvement of the ipsilateral hemisphere can be (i) of the premotor type, i.e. without ipsilateral motor projections but with significant activation of ipsilateral premotor areas, or (ii) of the primary motor type, i.e. with abnormal ipsilateral cortico-spinal projections to the paretic hand.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Cortical excitability of psychiatric disorders: reduced post-exercise facilitation in depression compared to schizophrenia and controls.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "7658379", "authors": ["Reid, PD", "Daniels, B", "Rybak, M", "Turnier-Shea, Y", "Pridmore, S"], "year": "2002", "journal": "The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry", "abstract": "We studied the excitability of the motor cortex in patients with migraine without aura (MWOA) (n = 20) and with chronic migraine (CM) (n = 20) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

We investigated the selective impact of TMS on two kinds of audio-visual pairings presented under identical spatio-temporal conditions (face-voice and tone-shape pairings).

This modulation has been widely studied in in vitro brain slices and in vivo animal models. More recently, transcranial magnetic stimulation has allowed detection of activity-dependent excitability modulation occurring in the intact human primary motor cortex (MI) after execution of different kinds of motor tasks. Both increased and decreased MI excitability have been described after exercise. While increased MI excitability is generally considered direct expression of cortical synaptic plasticity, a controversy still exists as to whether decreased MI excitability reflects fatigue of central nervous system (CNS) structures or cortical neuronal reorganization taking place after exercise. Here, we extend previous findings in order to provide further support for the latter hypothesis. Abduction- adduction movements of the thumb performed for 1 min at 2 Hz frequency rate produce a 55% decrease in MI excitability of mean 30 min duration. Similar decrements in amplitude and duration of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are not reached if the same task is performed once again during the maximal inhibition phase (10 min post-exercise) produced by a previous activation. Moreover, the same task performed at a lower (1 Hz) frequency rate produces no significant MEP changes but can transiently reverse activity-dependent depression obtained after previous 2 Hz movements. Repeated execution of the same task (2 Hz), each being performed after recovery from a previously induced MEP depression, ceases to produce an MEP decrement, suggesting adaptation in MI excitability modulation. This adaptation is long lasting and task-specific, since a different motor task (1 min circular movement of the thumb) restores activity-dependent modulation. Overall, these findings suggest that the dynamic modulation of MEPs occurring after execution of different kinds of simple motor skills reflects some form of activity-dependent, plastic neuronal reorganization instead of CNS fatigue. Possible anatomo-functional mechanisms involved in this activity-dependent modulation of MI excitability are discussed.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "99", "title": "Transitions between dynamical states of differing stability in the human brain.", "issue": "17", "pmid": "8912393", "authors": ["Meyer-Lindenberg, A", "Ziemann, U", "Hajak, G", "Cohen, L", "Berman, KF"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been tried in some Anxiety Disorders (Obsessive-compulsive disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) with different results.

This logic predicts a correlation between SP duration and RT when the stimulated cortex is involved in the response, and a stronger correlation when the stimulation is delivered later during the RT interval. The effect of TMS on RT was twofold: At early stimulation times, the stimulation shortened the RT and this effect was independent of the involvement of the stimulated motor cortex in the subsequent response. At later stimulation times, TMS had a disruptive effect, provided that the stimulated cortex was involved in the response.

This concept has led to a growing interest in the research of brain function in relation to gut motor and sensory function. Brain research on the mechanisms that are involved in the generation of gastrointestinal symptoms includes studies of the gut response to brain stimulation with technique such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or studies of the brain response to gut stimulation by cortical evoked potentials, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Studies using these techniques have shown that visceral/gut sensation involves activation of several brain regions that are associated with various brain functions, including sensation, cognition, and affect. The complexity of the brain response to visceral stimulation and the multidetermined nature of FGIDs make studies of brain function in FGID patients difficult and demands great caution in interpreting their results. Nevertheless, brain research in FGIDs is an emerging field and suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome differ from healthy subjects in the way that their brain response to visceral (e.g., rectal) distention. These studies emphasize the role of the central nervous system in conducting and processing visceral signals and suggest that alteration in brain processes involving perception and affective responses might be key factors in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal symptoms.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Tracing the timing of human analysis of motion and chromatic signals from occipital to temporo-parieto-occipital cortex: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "issue": "17", "pmid": "11059657", "authors": ["L\u00f6scher, WN", "Nordlund, MM"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Vision research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to investigate sensorimotor integration in the upper limb of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 10 age-matched controls. Non-conditioned and subthreshold conditioned (2 ms interstimulus interval) responses were recorded in the flexor and extensor carpi radialis muscles (FCR and ECR) of the more impaired (non-dominant) limb. Stimuli were delivered while the wrist joint was positioned statically at various joint angles as well as during different phases of passive movement of the wrist joint (90 degrees amplitude, 0.2 Hz). The FCR and ECR muscles remained relaxed during all stimulation. In both groups, responses in the static condition were larger when the target muscle was in a shortened position. Responses were also facilitated in the muscle shortening phases of passive movement. In both static and dynamic conditions, the extent of modulations in response amplitude was significantly reduced in the patient group. The level of intracortical inhibition (ICI) was also significantly less in the Parkinson's disease patients in static conditions. During passive movement, control subjects demonstrated a clear reduction in ICI compared with the static trials; however, the level of ICI was unchanged in the Parkinson's disease group in the dynamic condition. The results suggest an abnormal influence of afference on corticomotor excitability in Parkinson's disease.

Subjects had to indicate whether the part of the line to the left or right of the transection appeared longer. The stimulus display was back-projected on a screen at a viewing distance of either 50 or 150 cm (\"near\" and \"far\" space, respectively). Reaction times and choices were measured. In a forced-choice paradigm, subjects showed \"pseudoneglect\", the natural tendency of neurologically intact subjects to perceive the left side of a centrally transected line as slightly longer than the right. These errors occurred more for lines in near space than for lines in far space. Magnetic stimulation of the right posterior parietal cortex or the right ventral occipital lobe selectively induced a significant shift to the right in the perceived midpoint for near- and far-space lines, respectively. The results reproduced in normal subjects the dissociation between neglect in near and far space that has been described in patients with different right-hemisphere lesions.

Interhemispheric inhibition can be measured by applying a conditioning stimulus to the motor cortex resulting in inhibition of the contralateral motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation can also be used to demonstrate ipsilateral cortico-cortical inhibition in the motor cortex. At least two different ipsilateral cortico-cortical inhibitory processes have been identified: short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition. However, the relationship between interhemispheric inhibition and ipsilateral cortico-cortical inhibition remains unclear. This study examined the relationship between interhemispheric inhibition, short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition. First, the effect of test stimulus intensity on each inhibitory process was studied. Second, the effects of interhemispheric inhibition on short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition on interhemispheric inhibition were examined. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle in 11 right-handed healthy volunteers. For interhemispheric inhibition, conditioning stimuli were applied to the right motor cortex and test stimuli to the left motor cortex. For short interval intracortical inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition, both conditioning stimuli and test stimuli were applied to the left motor cortex. With increasing test stimulus intensities, long interval intracortical inhibition and interhemispheric inhibition decreased, while short interval intracortical inhibition increased. Moreover, short interval intracortical inhibition was significantly reduced in the presence of interhemispheric inhibition. Interhemispheric inhibition was significantly reduced in the presence of long interval intracortical inhibition when matched for test motor evoked potential amplitude but the difference was not significant when matched for test pulse intensity. These findings suggest that both interhemispheric inhibition and long interval intracortical inhibition are predominately mediated by low threshold cortical neurons and may share common inhibitory mechanisms. In contrast, the mechanisms mediating short interval intracortical inhibition are probably different from those mediating long interval intracortical inhibition and interhemispheric inhibition although these systems appear to interact.", "pages": "1-11"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "In vivo study indicating loss of intracortical inhibition in tumor-associated epilepsy.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11208978", "authors": ["Pierrot-Deseilligny, C", "M\u00fcri, RM", "Rivaud-Pechoux, S", "Gaymard, B", "Ploner, CJ"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "A recently devised test of motor cortex excitability (short latency afferent inhibition) was shown to be sensitive to the blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in healthy subjects.
