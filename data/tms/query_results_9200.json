Shorter latency and exclusively ipsilateral responses can be obtained if the position of the stimulating coil over the head is more lateral. These responses are uninfluenced by pre-activation of the muscle which suggests that they arise from stimulation of the peripheral nerve itself. By considering the conduction velocity of the nerve and the response latency such stimulation probably occurs in the proximal intracisternal segment (Fig. 2). The results obtained using magnetic stimulation of the cortex in patients with unilateral cerebral hemisphere lesions lend support to the idea of a bilateral projection from each cerebral hemisphere to the motor nuclei of the facial and hypoglossal nerves on both sides: stimulations over the intact hemisphere produces bilateral responses, whereas stimulations over the damaged hemisphere produce no responses (Fig. 1). In patients with idiopathic facial palsy no short latency responses were obtained on the affected side either during the acute (less than 10 days) or during the chronic phase (greater than 3 months) of the illness-despite clinical improvement during the chronic stage (Fig. 3, 4).

It has been shown that the motor units activated by threshold brain stimuli had the lowest threshold for voluntary activation (A = vol. activated, B = brain stim.). Onset latencies of 23 motor unit potentials from different sites in the relaxed muscles of four healthy subjects ranged from 22.4 to 32.4 ms (average: 26.4 ms; SD: 2.80 ms) but proved to be relatively stable when stimulating and recording conditions were kept constant (variation less than 0.5 ms, see poststimulus time histogram in Fig. 2).

On one occasion another motor unit of higher threshold was alternatively activated by this procedure (B-3 in Fig. 4). Since the same procedures are known to enhance the compound muscle action potentials as recorded from the relaxed muscle with surface electrodes, the shorter latencies of single motor units are considered to be caused by a facilitatory influence on the motoneurones.

The magnetic pulse is generated by a brief current pulse which passes through the stimulating coil, and the time varying magnetic field induces stimulating currents within the brain. Experimental evidence indicates that transcranial magnetic stimulation as opposed to electrical brain stimulation activated corticospinal neurones transsynaptically. With a circular stimulating coil centered near the vertex, upper limb muscles of the right side are preferentially activated with the inducing current clockwise viewed from above and vice versa. For the leg muscles the optimal position of the coil on the scalp is more critical and varies from subject to subject. Voluntary contraction of the target muscle reduces the threshold stimulus intensity, increases the amplitude and shortens the latency of the evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). This facilitatory effect of background muscle activity is most pronounced in the small hand muscles, where only a slight contraction is sufficient to greatly enhance the responses. In a relaxed small hand muscle facilitation of the responses can also be achieved by contraction of either the homologous contralateral or a neighbouring ipsilateral muscle. Even in relaxed state, the CMAPs show an inherent variability which is not related to the subject's motor readiness or mental state in any obvious way, provided the muscles' relaxed state is ascertained.

With the ADM relaxed, vibration produced an early enhancement of compound responses (CMAPs) after transcranial magnetic brain stimuli. This is thought to be due to simultaneous arrival of the descending corticospinal volley and of the afferent la volley at the anterior horn cell. With long lasting vibration an enhancement of responses to brain stimuli continued up to 5 seconds after the onset of vibration. Voluntary muscle contraction increased the CMAP.

For small hand muscles, the overall latency from scalp to muscle is shorter by 1.8 ms when electrical stimuli are used than when stimuli are magnetic. Central motor conduction time (CMCT) can be estimated by stimulating over the scalp and then over the cervical area. In healthy subjects, the CMCT is 6.1 +/- 0.8 (SD) (n = 29). Physiological studies have shown that the facilitation of responses in hand muscles produced by voluntary contraction is also present when contralateral muscles are used, but not when a leg muscle is contracted. The mechanism of facilitation may involve neural activity at both spinal and cortical levels. Single motor units can be caused to discharge by threshold brain stimuli. These motor units are the same ones activated first during weak voluntary contractions. Clinical studies have shown that the CMCT may be greatly prolonged in patients with multiple sclerosis and that subclinical motor pathway lesions can be detected. Central conduction may also be abnormal in patients with motor neuron disease and cervical myelopathy. Side effects have not been encountered with either type of stimulator.", "pages": "217-24"}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "1059308", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "",
