Painful CO2 laser stimuli delivered on the hand skin reduced significantly the amplitude of MEPs evoked by the transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral MI area, while the MEP amplitude was not significantly modified by CO2 laser pulses delivered on the arm skin. The inhibitory effect followed the arrival of the nociceptive inputs to the cerebral cortex. The amplitude of MEPs evoked by anodal electrical stimulation of the motor cortex was not decreased by conditioning painful stimuli delivered on the hand dorsum. Since the magnetic stimulation led to transynaptic activation of pyramidal neurons, while the anodal stimulation activated directly corticospinal axons, our findings suggest that CO2 laser pulses delivered on the hand are able to inhibit the arm proximal muscle motor area.", "pages": "271-6"}, {"volume": "534", "title": "Changes in intracortical excitability induced by stimulation of wrist afferents in man.", "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "19589195", "authors": ["Aimonetti, JM", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2001", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "In a recent study we showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with train duration of 400 ms over right frontal and right posterior parietal cortices gives rise to transitory contralateral visuo-spatial neglect in normal subjects.

Impaired intracortical inhibition, as found in ALS, is not unique to this disease, but is also a well-established finding in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study explored whether reduced inhibition in the motor cortex in PD is accompanied by similar changes in motor unit firing modulation by TMS as are found in ALS. TMS was applied to the contralateral motor cortex during a low-force voluntary elbow flexion while 126-channel surface electromyography (SEMG) was recorded from the brachial biceps muscle. A recently developed method for SEMG decomposition was used to extract the firing pattern of up to five simultaneously active MUs. Sixteen MUs in 7 PD patients and 17 MUs in 5 healthy control subjects were analysed and peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) and interspike interval change functions (IICFs) were calculated. The IICF provides an estimate of the modulation of the postsynaptic membrane potential at the spinal motoneuron, evoked by the stimulus. In PD the duration of the PSTH peak was significantly increased and the synchrony was decreased. The excitatory phase at 20-50 ms of the IICF was broader in PD, reflecting a longer duration of the TMS-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential.

Patterns of MEP facilitation in each hand were compared with measures of manual performance (finger tapping speed, Purdue pegboard, maximal FDI strength). Threshold TMS intensities for an MEP in FDI at rest were similar in LH and RH subjects, and did not vary between hands. Facilitation of the MEP with voluntary activation was larger overall on the left side (P<0.05), but the asymmetry was dependent on the degree of lateralisation of hand preference. For subjects with consistent hand preference (either LH or RH), MEP facilitation in active FDI was larger for the left hand. For non-consistent RH subjects, contraction-induced MEP facilitation was larger in the right FDI muscle than the left. Asymmetry of MEP facilitation was not correlated with differences between hands in finger tapping speed or performance in the pegboard task, but was associated with relative differences in FDI strength. MEP facilitation tended to be larger in the stronger FDI muscle of the pair. We conclude that corticospinal involvement in the command for index finger abduction is generally greater when the left hand is used, although in RH subjects the asymmetry is influenced by the degree of lateralisation of hand preference.

The findings show that rTMS changes the duration of cortical SPs; the effect is probably due to the modulation of intracortical inhibitory interneurons depending on the frequency and intensity of stimulation.", "pages": "271-6"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Changes in corticomotor representations induced by prolonged peripheral nerve stimulation in humans.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "10422717", "authors": ["Ridding, MC", "McKay, DR", "Thompson, PD", "Miles, TS"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Upper motor neuron involvement in ALS has been widely studied by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation and various imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, proton emission tomography, single photon emission computer tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Although almost all of these methods have detected 'abnormalities' of the motor cortex, no method has yet proven to be capable of monitoring disease progression. We and others have used peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) to evaluate corticomotoneuronal dysfunction. The primary peak (PP) in the PSTH reflects the initial rising phase of the excitatory post-synaptic potential evoked at the anterior horn cell by converging corticomotoneurons. In ALS, the PP is delayed in onset, increased in duration, and desynchronized. These abnormalities become more pronounced over time. Delayed PPs also occur more frequently in non-hereditary ALS (nHALS) with disease progression and are a hallmark of the autosomal recessively inherited D90A Cu-Zn SOD mutation. Evidence indicates that in this particular mutation, as well as in nHALS, the fast-conducting monosynaptic pathway originating from large pyramidal Betz cells is preferentially lost, whereas a slow-conducting pathway seems to be spared. This is most likely due to the enormous metabolic demand of the large pyramidal cells, which may explain the selective vulnerability of the most recent phylogenetic system to develop in the human nervous system.", "pages": "271-6"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "New graphical method to measure silent periods evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "10618158", "authors": ["Garvey, MA", "Ziemann, U", "Becker, DA", "Barker, CA", "Bartko, JJ"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Owing to the low sensitivity of clinical signs in assessing upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement in ALS, there is a need for investigative tools capable of detecting abnormal function of the pyramidal tract. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may contribute to the diagnosis by reflecting a UMN dysfunction that is not clinically detectable. Several parameters for the motor responses to TMS can be evaluated with different levels of significance in healthy subjects compared with ALS patients. The central motor conduction time, however, is not sensitive in detecting subclinical UMN defects in individual ALS patients. The amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP), expressed as the percentage of the maximum wave, also has a low sensitivity. In some cases, the corticomotor threshold is decreased early in the disease course as a result of corticomotor neuron hyperexcitability induced by glutamate. Later, the threshold increases, indicating a loss of UMN. In our experience, a decreased silent period duration appears to be the most sensitive parameter when using motor TMS in ALS. TMS is also a sensitive technique for investigating the corticobulbar tract, which is difficult to study by other methods. TMS is a widely available, painless and safe technique with a good sensitivity that can visualize both corticospinal and corticobulbar tract abnormalities.

The FPs in strong muscles are predominantly simple and stable, and can often be recruited by a slight voluntary contraction. In weak and atrophic muscles, the FPs are generally complex and unstable, tend to have a slower firing rate and are not recruited by voluntary contraction. Macro-electromyography studies suggest that these FPs are part of a more complex motor unit, as opposed to simple FPs which can represent all the motor unit. FPs driven by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were observed in 13 ALS patients. TMS-driven fasciculations had a simple morphology and were stable. Complex potentials were never cortically driven. These observations strengthen the conviction that fasciculations in ALS can have different origins. Simple, stable FPs arise proximally and are probably related to excitotoxicity phenomena, while complex, unstable FPs are most likely to originate in distal axonal sprouts that are associated with the reinnervation process. Some ALS patients with fatigue and mild weakness can have profuse fasciculations at an early phase in the evolution of the disease.

Ballistic and associated posture-adjusting movements are delayed by magnetic stimulation in the same way, and similar cortical mechanisms appear to be included. Patients with motor neglect, normal MEPs and remarkably prolonged silent period show inability to initiate movement for several seconds after magnetic stimulation, and strong and long-lasting intracortical inhibition are observed. Motor neglect can be produced by strong inhibitory inputs to the motor cortex. Neural plasticity is studied in patients with brain and peripheral lesions; ipsilateral MEPs, enlargement of muscle representation in the cortex, and contribution of descending pathways other than corticospinal tract are reported. Central control of spinal reflex activities is also important in motor control.

Using peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) it is possible to estimate the size of a unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). In ALS the EPSP is typically desynchronized. With time it becomes reduced in amplitude and a slow conducting component becomes recognizable in the primary peak of the PSTH. This reflects conduction through a slow motor pathway.

However, the specific role it performs in sequence learning has remained uncertain. This type of skill has been intensively studied using the serial reaction time task. We used three versions of this task: a standard task where the position of the stimulus cued the response; a non-standard task where the color of the stimulus was related to the correct response; and a combined task where both the color and position simultaneously cued the response. We refer to each of these tasks based upon the cues available for guiding learning as position, color and combined tasks. The combined task usually shows an enhancement of skill acquisition, a result of being driven by two simultaneous and congruent cues. Prior to the performance of each of these tasks the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was disrupted using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. This completely prevented learning within the position task, while sequence learning occurred to a similar extent in both the color and combined tasks. So, following prefrontal stimulation the expected learning enhancement in the combined task was lost, consistent with only a color cue being available to guide sequence learning in the combined task. Neither of these effects was observed following stimulation at the parietal cortex. Hence the critical role played by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in sequence learning is related exclusively to spatial cues. We suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operates over the short term to retain and manipulate spatial information to allow cortical and subcortical structures to learn a predictable sequence of actions. Such functions may emerge from the broader role the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has in spatial working memory.

This study addresses whether in human subjects indirect corticospinal excitation of upper limb motoneurones (MNs) relayed through presumed cervical propriospinal neurones (PNs) is paralleled by corticospinal activation of inhibitory projections to these premotoneurones. 2. The responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), whether assessed as the compound motor-evoked potential (MEP) or the peak of corticospinal excitation elicited in the post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of single motor units, were conditioned by weak volleys to musculo-cutaneous, ulnar and superficial radial nerves. 3. Afferent volleys, which hardly modified the H reflex, significantly facilitated the corticospinal response produced by weak TMS. In PSTHs, the central delay of the peripheral facilitation of the peak of corticospinal excitation in MNs located at either end of the cervical enlargement was longer the more caudal the MN pool, suggesting an interaction in premotoneurones located rostral to the tested MNs. 4. Small increases in the strength of TMS (approximately 2--5 % of the maximal stimulator output) caused the facilitation to disappear and then to be reversed to inhibition. The facilitatory and inhibitory effects had the same latencies and spared the initial 0.5--1 ms of the corticospinal excitatory response. Both effects were more readily demonstrable when there was a co-contraction of the target muscle and the muscle innervated by nerve used for the conditioning stimulus. 5. The above features suggest that the inhibition resulted from disfacilitation due to suppression of corticospinal excitation passing through the presumed premotoneuronal relay. The reversal of the facilitation to inhibition by stronger corticospinal volleys is consistent with a well-developed system of 'feedback inhibitory interneurones' activated by corticospinal and afferent inputs inhibiting the presumed propriospinal excitatory premotoneurones. 6.

The preoperative motor evoked potentials were large and polyphasic, and consisted of early and late components.

Intracortical inhibition in the affected motor cortex was also disrupted preoperatively and improved after MST. Postoperative recruitment order of muscle responses to TMS was bilaterally symmetrical, indicating that MST did not interfere with the function of the corticospinal tract neurones. The patient showed fair motor recovery and good seizure control after the operation. These results of TMS studies demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of MST not only on intractable seizure but also on abnormal motor cortical organization and hyperexcitability in cortical dysgenesis.", "pages": "271-6"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy in a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11458829", "authors": ["Rollnik, JD", "Seifert, J", "Huber, TJ", "Becker, H", "Panning, B", "Schneider, U", "Emrich, HM"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Depression and anxiety", "abstract": "Twenty-five children at the ages of 3 to 18 years with an initial diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were followed in the Clinic of Child Neurology for a period of 2 to 8 years.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in 15 children disclosed multiple hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging in 13 children: 10 with definite multiple sclerosis and 3 with suspected multiple sclerosis. The clinical manifestations did not always correspond to the size and location of the MRI lesions of demyelination. Follow-up revealed normalization of the neurologic examination in 18 patients (72%) and abnormal neurologic findings in 7 patients (28%) (6 children with definite multiple sclerosis and 1 with suspected multiple sclerosis). Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up in children with definite multiple sclerosis disclosed a reduction in the size of the lesions in 3; enlargement or new lesions were established in the other 7 cases, and 2 cases were without clinical signs of new attacks. Correlation was done concerning the findings of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, transcranial magnetic stimulation, evoked potentials, computed tomography, and MRI. The role of MRI for an early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in children is discussed.

CI therapy consists of a family of therapies; their common element is that they induce persons with stroke to greatly increase the use of a more-affected upper extremity (UE) for many hours a day over a 2- to 3-week period. These therapies have significantly improved quality of movement and substantially increased amount of use of a more-affected UE in the activities of daily living in life situations. A number of neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that the massed practice of CI therapy produces a massive use-dependent cortical reorganization that increases the area of cortex involved in the innervation of movement of the more-affected UE. The intensity and schedule of delivery of this very efficacious therapy is quite different from that of more traditional physical rehabilitation approaches. As a result, to be clinically applicable, the CI therapy approach to rehabilitation will likely require a paradigm shift in the delivery of physical rehabilitation services.", "pages": "271-6"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Orthostatic tremor arises from an oscillator in the posterior fossa.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11457420", "authors": ["Wu, YR", "Ashby, P", "Lang, AE"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The effects of different phases of an observed movement on the modulation of cortical motor output were studied by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

The study was performed in eight normal volunteers using two Magstim-200 stimulators linked with a Bistim module. A circular TMS coil was held in the scanner by a mechanical arm and located over the left M1. Surface electrodes were used to record motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). Cortical excitability was evaluated in the relaxed FDI using a paired conditioning-test stimulus paradigm with two interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 3 and 12 ms. The subjects were scanned three times during each of the following four conditions: 1) baseline with no TMS (BASE); 2) single-pulse TMS (TMSsing); 3) 3-ms paired-pulse TMS (TMS3); and 4) 12-ms paired-pulse TMS (TMS12). CBF and peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes were measured over each 60-s scanning period. To assess TMS-induced changes in CBF, a t-statistic map was generated by first subtracting the single-pulse TMS condition from the 3- and 12-ms paired-pulse TMS conditions and then correlating the CBF differences, respectively, with the amount of suppression and facilitation of the EMG responses. A significant positive correlation was observed between the CBF difference (TMS3-TMSsing) and the amount of suppression of EMG response, as well as between the CBF difference (TMS12-TMSsing) and the amount of facilitation of EMG response. This positive correlation was observed in the left M1, left lateral premotor cortex, and right M1 in the case of 3-ms paired-pulse TMS, but only in the left M1 in the case of 12-ms paired-pulse TMS. The above pattern of CBF response to paired-pulse TMS supports the possibility that suppression and facilitation of the EMG response are mediated by different populations of cortical interneurons.", "pages": "271-6"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Impairment of motor cortex activation and deactivation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11438765", "authors": ["Chen, R", "Kumar, S", "Garg, RR", "Lang, AE"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is being investigated as an alternative treatment for depression. However, little is known about the clinical role and the neurophysiological mechanisms of the action of rTMS in these patients. In this study, 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to map the effects of left dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS on prefrontal activity in seven patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression resistant to pharmacological treatment. rTMS consisted of 30 trains of 2-s duration stimuli (20 Hz, 90% of motor threshold), separated by 30-s pauses. Each patient underwent three SPECTs: at baseline; during the first rTMS; and 1 week after 10 daily sessions of rTMS. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of each cerebral region was normalized to the rCBF value in the cerebellum and relative changes in normalized rCBF were addressed using a region-of-interest analysis. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used for clinical evaluation before and after rTMS. A significant rCBF increase after the 10 sessions of rTMS was found in the left prefrontal region (MANOVA F=5.29, d.f.=2,10, P=0.027), but no significant rCBF changes were found during the first rTMS session. The remaining cerebral regions showed no significant rCBF changes at any time. Only two patients showed a clinical improvement after rTMS, with 50% reduction of the initial HDRS score. The study was repeated under placebo conditions (identical design but addressing coil discharges to the air) in these two patients, who failed to show any rCBF increase during sham-rTMS. No relationship was found between the percentage of left prefrontal rCBF change and the clinical findings. In conclusion, rTMS of the left prefrontal cortex induces a significant rCBF increase in this region, despite the limited clinical effect in our sample of depressed patients.

We investigated the effect of noxious and non-noxious conditioning stimuli applied to right and left digit II and right digit V on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from right thenar eminence, abductor digiti minimi, biceps and triceps brachii muscles in twelve healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied at interstimulus intervals (ISI) ranging from 40 to 160 ms following conditioning distal digital stimulation. TMS and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) were compared at ISI 80 ms. Painful digital stimulation caused differential MEP amplitude modulation with an early maximum inhibition in hand muscles and triceps brachii followed by a maximum facilitation in arm muscles. Stimulation of different digits elicited a similar pattern of MEP modulation, which largely paralleled the behavior of cutaneous silent periods in the same muscles. Contralateral digital stimulation was less effective. MEPs following TMS and TES did not differ in their response to noxious digital stimulation. MEP latencies were shortened by cutaneous stimuli. The observed effects were stimulus intensity dependent. We conclude that activation of A-alpha and A-delta fibers gives rise to complex modulatory effects on upper limb motoneuron pools. A-delta fibers initiate a spinal reflex resulting in MEP amplitude reduction in muscles involved in reaching and grasping, and MEP amplitude facilitation in muscles involved in withdrawal. These findings suggest a protective reflex mediated by A-delta fibers that protects the hand from harm. A-alpha fibers induce MEP latency shortening possibly via a transcortical excitatory loop.", "pages": "271-6"}]
