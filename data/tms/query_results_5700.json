We found that, irrespective of the task, a virtual lesion of iM1 altered the timing of the muscle recruitment. In the grip-lift task, this led to a less coordinated sequence of grip and lift movements and in the step-tracking task, to a perturbation of the movement trajectory. In the step-tracking task, we have demonstrated that disrupting iM1 activity may, depending on the TMS delay, either advance or delay the muscle recruitment. The present study suggests that iM1 plays a critical role in hand movements by contributing to the setting of the muscle recruitment timing, most likely through either inhibitory or facilitatory transcallosal influences onto the contralateral M1 (cM1). iM1 would therefore contribute to shape precisely the muscular command originating from cM1.", "pages": "1-7"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Functional reorganization and recovery after constraint-induced movement therapy in subacute stroke: case reports.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16518133", "authors": ["Ro, T", "Noser, E", "Boake, C", "Johnson, R", "Gaber, M", "Speroni, A", "Bernstein, M", "De Joya, A", "Scott Burgin, W", "Zhang, L", "Taub, E", "Grotta, JC", "Levin, HS"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neurocase", "abstract": "We tested whether the frontal eye field (FEF) is critical in controlling visual processing in posterior visual brain areas during the orienting of spatial attention.

In the main experiment a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (CS) preceded a suprathreshold test stimulus (TS) at different inter-stimulus intervals. We found that perception of a peripheral electrical stimulus was markedly attenuated by paired TMS in comparison to single pulse TMS when the ISIs was 10 or 15 ms, while there was no effect at shorter ISIs.

We investigated right-handed patients with left hemisphere brain tumors as a model of continuously progressive brain damage to left hemisphere language areas using functional neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to identify factors which determine successful compensation of lost language function.

The authors report the use of functional imaging-guided frameless stereotactic surgery for epidural MCS. Five patients underwent MCS in which functional imaging guidance was used. Prior to surgery, patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with skin fiducial markers placed on standard anatomical reference prints, followed by magnetoencephalography (MEG) mapping of the sensory and motor cortices. In two patients, functional MR imaging was also performed using a motor task paradigm. The functional imaging data were integrated into a frameless stereotactic database by using a three-dimensional coregistration algorithm. Subsequently, a frameless stereotactic craniotomy was performed using the integrated anatomical and functional imaging data for surgical planning. Intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and direct stimulation were used to confirm the target and final placement of the electrode. Direct stimulation and SSEPs performed intraoperatively confirmed the accuracy of the functional imaging data. Trial periods of stimulation successfully reduced pain in three of the five patients who then underwent permanent internal placement of the system. At a mean 6-month follow up, these patients reported an average reduction in pain of 55% on a visual analog scale.

Converging evidence supporting these insights comes from new imaging modalities in acute stroke, functional imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electrophysiological studies in humans, and single-cell recording studies in nonhuman primates.", "pages": "1-7"}, {"volume": "95", "title": "Intracortical inhibition during volitional inhibition of prepared action.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "1891097", "authors": ["Coxon, JP", "Stinear, CM", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "In the course of daily living, humans frequently encounter situations in which a motor activity, once initiated, becomes unnecessary or inappropriate.

Single-cell recording studies performed in non-human primates have demonstrated that a region of the parietal lobe known as the lateral intraparietal area is specialized in the planning and control of saccadic eye movements. The homologue of this area in humans is termed the parietal eye fields (PEF) and its role in relation to saccades has previously been examined using TMS. In this paper individual variability in the functional effect of parietal TMS on the latency, amplitude and angular direction of visually-guided saccades has been assessed. By examining individual variability in the spatial distribution of scalp-based localization and brain surface anatomy and stereotaxic localizations of the PEF it was shown that the distances between the sites determined by these three methods were not negligible, which raises problems regarding the most reliable anatomical localization technique to use. An assessment of the effect of TMS on saccade metrics (latency, amplitude error and angular error) at a grid of locations over parietal cortex demonstrated a large amount of intra-individual variability in the site where TMS had most affected saccades, leading to the conclusion that there is individual variability in the functional effects of parietal TMS on saccade planning and execution. This study confirms the idea that it may be problematic to use a fixed scalp location for every participant in a study. It may in fact be more appropriate to determine TMS sites functionally on an individual basis if possible.

To dissociate the role of PMv and PMd in the control of hand and finger movements, we produced, by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transient virtual lesions of these two areas in both hemispheres, in healthy subjects performing a grip-lift task with their right, dominant hand. We found that a virtual lesion of PMv specifically impaired the grasping component of these movements: a lesion of either the left or right PMv altered the correct positioning of fingers on the object, a prerequisite for an efficient grasping, whereas lesioning the left, contralateral PMv disturbed the sequential recruitment of intrinsic hand muscles, all other movement parameters being unaffected by PMv lesions. Conversely, we found that a virtual lesion of the left PMd impaired the proper coupling between the grasping and lifting phases, as evidenced by the TMS-induced delay in the recruitment of proximal muscles responsible for the lifting phase; lesioning the right PMd failed to affect dominant hand movements. Finally, an analysis of the time course of these effects allowed us to demonstrate the sequential involvement of PMv and PMd in movement preparation.

With this in mind, we therefore examined several cortical areas as stimulation targets using a navigation-guided rTMS and compared the effects of the different targets on pain. Twenty patients with intractable deafferentation pain received rTMS of M1, the postcentral gyrus (S1), premotor area (preM), and supplementary motor area (SMA).

These structural alterations are mirrored by changes in cortical evoked potentials attributed to the GM changes and demonstrate the rapid dynamics of these processes, which occur within a time range characteristic for the onset of behavioral effects induced by a variety of treatment methods for neuropsychiatric diseases. Our finding suggests that cortical plasticity on a structural level in adult humans is already detectable after 1 week, which provides support for fast adjusting neuronal systems, such as spine and synapse turnover, and contradicts slow evolving mechanisms, such as neuronal or glial cell genesis.", "pages": "1-7"}, {"volume": "1072", "title": "Interhemispheric imbalance during visuospatial attention investigated by unilateral and bilateral TMS over human parietal cortices.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "14527615", "authors": ["Dambeck, N", "Sparing, R", "Meister, IG", "Wienemann, M", "Weidemann, J", "Topper, R", "Boroojerdi, B"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "This study investigated transmission of corticospinal output through motoneurons over a wide range of voluntary contraction strengths in humans. During voluntary contraction of biceps brachii, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex grow up to about 50% maximal force and then decrease. To determine whether the decrease reflects events at a cortical or spinal level, responses to stimulation of the cortex and corticospinal tract (cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials, CMEPs) as well as maximal M-waves (M(max)) were recorded during strong contractions at 50 to 100% maximum. In biceps and brachioradialis, MEPs and CMEPs (normalized to M(max)) evoked by strong stimuli decreased during strong elbow flexions. Responses were largest during contractions at 75% maximum and both potentials decreased by about 25% M(max) during maximal efforts (P < 0.001). Reductions were smaller with weaker stimuli, but again similar for MEPs and CMEPs. Thus the reduction in MEPs during strong voluntary contractions can be accounted for by reduced responsiveness of the motoneuron pool to stimulation. During strong contractions of the first dorsal interosseous, a muscle that increases voluntary force largely by frequency modulation, MEPs declined more than in either elbow flexor muscle (35% M(max), P < 0.001). This suggests that motoneuron firing rates are important determinants of evoked output from the motoneuron pool. However, motor cortical output does not appear to be limited at high contraction strengths.", "pages": "1-7"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Induction of long-lasting changes of visual cortex excitability by five daily sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in healthy volunteers and migraine patients.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "14683727", "authors": ["Fumal, A", "Coppola, G", "Bohotin, V", "G\u00e9rardy, PY", "Seidel, L", "Donneau, AF", "Vandenheede, M", "Maertens de Noordhout, A", "Schoenen, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technique for non-invasive stimulation of human cortex.

We provide such a characterization by showing that 5 Hz rTMS over primary somatosensory cortex (SI) induces a reconfiguration of activity patterns in a sensorimotor network, comprising the stimulated region and ipsilateral primary motor cortex (MI). These plastic changes endure for up to 120 min and are correlated with behavioral improvement in discrimination. Dynamic causal modeling showed that this reconfiguration could be explained by an rTMS-induced increase in SI excitability (self-connection) and an increase in the effective connectivity from SI to MI.

We employed the paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, an experimental intervention involving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and median nerve stimulation capable of producing long-term potentiation (LTP) like changes in the sensorimotor system in humans. We studied the more affected side of 16 moderately affected patients with Parkinson's disease (9 dyskinetic, 7 non-dyskinetic) and the dominant side of 9 age-matched healthy controls.

Levodopa restored the potentiation of MEP amplitudes by PAS in the non-dyskinetic group (T30: +64.9% of baseline MEP) but not in the dyskinetic group (T30: -9.2% of baseline). PAS prolonged CSP duration in controls. There was a trend towards prolongation of CSP in the non-dyskinetic group off medications but not in the dyskinetic group. Levodopa did not restore CSP prolongation by PAS in the dyskinetic group.

This interaction between M1 and muscle can be measured by the analysis of corticomuscular coherence in the beta-frequency range (beta-CMCoh; 14-30 Hz). Largely based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) source-modeling data, it is widely assumed that beta-CMCoh reflects direct coupling between M1 and muscle. Deafferentation is capable of modulating beta-CMCoh, however, and therefore the influence of reafferent somatosensory signaling and corresponding neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex (S1) has been unclear. We present transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and MEG data from three adult patients suffering from congenital hemiparesis due to pre- and perinatally acquired lesions of the pyramidal tract. In these patients, interhemispheric reorganization had resulted in relocation of M1 to the contralesional hemisphere, ipsilateral to the paretic hand, whereas S1 had remained in the lesioned hemisphere. This topographic dichotomy allowed for an unequivocal topographic differentiation of M1 and S1 with MEG (which is not possible if M1 and S1 are directly adjacent within one hemisphere). In all patients, beta-CMCoh originated from the contralesional M1, in accordance with the TMS-evoked motor responses, and in contrast to the somatosensory evoked fields (SEFs) for which the sources (N20m) were localized in S1 of the lesioned hemisphere. These data provide direct evidence for the concept that beta-CMCoh reflects the motorcortical efferent drive from M1 to the spinal motoneuron pool and muscle.

The TMS induced currents were significantly altered for stimulation proximal to the lesion site in all of the models analyzed.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used both as a central perturbation evoking a movement and as a tool for quantifying the CS excitability before the movement was evoked. TMS was applied at mid-stance (evoking additional hip extension) or at the beginning of the swing (evoking hip flexion) with a random phase, thus evoking unpredictable flexion or extension movement. This was compared to a condition of fixed phase, in which the subjects knew in advance the direction of the evoked movement. In both conditions, we compared the amplitude of the TMS-evoked movement and the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of the muscles acting at the hip joint (RF/BF) according to two opposite instructions, either to cognitively prepare to \"let go\", or to cognitively prepare to \"compensate\" for the evoked movements. The results showed that the subjects were able to compensate for random TMS-evoked movements, but with a lower performance level in comparison to the fixed TMS-evoked movements. When they succeeded in the random-phase condition, the subjects used the same preparation strategy as in the fixed-phase condition; preparing to compensate resulted in a selective increase in the CS excitability to those muscles which would be involved in counteracting the possible central perturbation.

These include the non-response rate of approximately 30% to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy, side effects of available antidepressants and the latency of several weeks until clinical improvement. The only non-pharmacological biological treatment options available so far which exert more rapid antidepressant efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy and, as an augmentation strategy, sleep deprivation. Current pharmacological treatments aim to enhance serotonergic and/or noradrenergic neurotransmission. In spite of emerging knowledge, the crucial mechanisms underlying both non-pharmacological treatments, which are responsible for antidepressant efficacy, are not yet clear so far. In the meantime several new pharmacological principles are under investigation with regard to their putative antidepressant potency. These include 5-HT1A receptor agonists, tachykinin receptor antagonists and various interventions within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. While there is evidence for antidepressant properties of these new treatments in animal studies, in case series, in open studies and to some degree also in placebo controlled studies, no definite proof for the antidepressant efficacy of these new pharmacological strategies according to the requirements for evaluation of antidepressant drugs has been furnished so far. In contrast, for the established non-pharmacological treatment strategies including bright light therapy the clinical efficacy has been proven at least in subgroups of depression, but more knowledge of the main mechanisms underlying their antidepressant efficacy is still necessary. In addition new non-pharmacological treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and Vagus nerve stimulation are currently under development.

It is possible that poor response in psychotic depression is caused by the fact that we have yet to identify the most efficacious treatment protocol for psychotic MDD. Multiple studies have shown that modifications in the treatment paradigm may increase treatment efficacy in psychotic MDD. It has been generally accepted that, during the acute treatment phase, antidepressant-antipsychotic drug combination therapy is more effective than either treatment alone, although this strategy has recently been challenged.
