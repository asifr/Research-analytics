We also compared MEPs recorded following D2 stimulation just above perception threshold to MEPs following higher intensity D2 stimulation. As well, we assessed the effect of preceding D2 stimulation on MEPs recorded from a relaxed versus tonically contracted hand muscle. D2 stimulation elicited a triphasic response of modest MEP facilitation followed by inhibition and further facilitation. The duration and onset of MEP inhibition correlated with those of the initial period of rectified EMG inhibition, however, the magnitude of MEP inhibition was generally less than the magnitude of EMG inhibition, consistent with a greater inhibitory effect of digital afferents on smaller motor neurons. MEPs were not facilitated during the rebound of EMG activity (the E2 period) that usually followed the initial period of EMG inhibition (I1 period). The behavior of H-reflexes and F-responses following ipsilateral D2 stimulation suggested that inhibition of both EMG and MEPs is not mediated via presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents, and that inhibition is augmented by descending rather than segmental input to spinal motor neurons.

During the auditory reaction time, a transcranial magnetic stimulus was delivered to observe changes in the excitability of the central nervous system. A dual-cone coil was used, which effectively stimulated the fairly deep-lying lower limb motor cortex. Stimuli were delivered in a random order with 20-300-ms delays from the auditory go-signal.

The late MEP appeared earlier in the simple reaction time task than in the choice reaction time task, reflecting faster central processing of simple reaction time tasks.

The voluntary discharge characteristics, short term synchronization, coherence and responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation of a sample of twenty-two pairs of simultaneously recorded low threshold motor units in the right human first dorsal interosseus muscle have been determined. 2. Peristimulus time histograms and cumulative sums (cusums) of motor unit discharge showed either excitatory or inhibitory responses to cortical stimuli. Over the whole motor unit sample, the primary excitatory response had a mean onset of 24.6 ms and the inhibitory response a mean onset of 31.0 ms. Responses of pairs of motor units to magnetic stimulation could be dissimilar; at some stimulus intensities one of the motor unit pair could be excited by the stimulus whilst the other was inhibited. 3. Most pairs of motor units showed short term synchrony in their voluntary discharge, but the same motor units driven by magnetic cortical stimuli showed little tendency to discharge together more frequently than would be predicted from their independent behaviour. This held true for discharges in both the early primary excitatory peak and in the later secondary peak in peristimulus time histograms. 4. Series of magnetic stimuli, causing either excitation or inhibition of individual tonically active motor units, had no effect on the size of the central peak of the cross-correlogram of the motor unit pair. However, frequency analysis of pairs of motor unit spike trains showed an increase in coherence in the 16-32 Hz band during magnetic stimulation. 5. It is concluded that, whilst many corticospinal fibres branch extensively within motoneurone pools, there are also fast conducting corticomotoneuronal fibres allowing the independent monosynaptic activation of individual motoneurones. 6.

Information about the cortically evoked postsynaptic potentials was derived from peristimulus time histograms generated from the discharge times of single, rhythmically active, motor units. Tibialis anterior (TA) motoneurons were almost exclusively facilitated and response magnitudes were consistent within a motoneuron pool as indicated by low coefficients of variation (CV). The net cortical effect on soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) motoneurons was significantly weaker than in TA (P < 0.001) and the responses were non-homogeneous within a motoneuron pool, both in terms of response amplitude and direction. The occurrence of strong facilitatory and inhibitory responses or an absence of a response within a given MG motoneuron pool was associated with CVs about 13 times that of TA and 4 times that of SOL. The large CVs may be indicative of the existence of subgroups of motoneurons differentiated by their response to TMS.

Multichannel surface EMG recording was performed during reinforcement manoeuvres and during vibratory tonic reflex. Twenty-five post-traumatic clinically incomplete (ambulatory, AMB, and non-ambulatory, nAMB) SCI subjects were studied and compared to a control group of seven subjects. After preliminary analysis of neurophysiological studies they were divided into four groups according to presence or absence of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in response to TMS in muscles below the level of the lesion and according to their ability to ambulate. TMS was delivered at vertex at 100% intensity and recorded from the large muscles of the upper and lower limbs. Surface EMG was recorded during reinforcement manoeuvres (RM) in the leg muscles and EMG activity was scored. SSEP were recorded at T12, L2, L4 and SI spinous processes and at Cz' on the scalp following tibial nerve stimulation at popliteal fossa. The prevalence of EMG responses during RM was higher in group with present MEPs (AMB/MEP+ and nAMB/MEP+) than in the group without MEPs. The group with present MEPs also showed better preserved functions of the ascending tracts compared to subjects without MEPs. Groups with present MEPs had 5/10 normal, 2/10 abnormal and 3/10 absent cortical SSEPs, whereas groups without MEPs showed 1/11 normal, 4/11 abnormal and 6/11 absent cortical SSEPs.

No significant modifications in post-exercise MEP amplitude were found in ipsilateral non-exercised muscles. In order to determine the level where these changes take place, we recorded the M and F waves induced by median nerve stimulation at the wrist (all subjects) and MEPs in response to transcranial electrical stimulation (five subjects) at rest and during the decrease and maximal depression phases. None of these tests were significantly affected by exercise, indicating that the motor cortex was the site of change. Evaluation of maps of cortical outputs to the target muscle, performed in four subjects, showed an approximately 40% spatial reduction in stimulation sites evoking a motor response during the maximal depression phase.

Excitatory EMRs could be elicited in the voluntarily relaxed soleus muscle of the majority of subjects during sitting.

H-reflex and MVC recovery after fatiguing, sustained MVC were also studied independently in additional sessions. TMS-induced MEPs were significantly reduced for 20 min following MVC, but only in the exercised TA muscle. Comparing TMS and TES mean MEP amplitudes, we found that, over the first 5 min following the fatiguing MVC, they were decreased by about 55% for each. M-wave responses were unchanged. H-reflex amplitude and MVC force recovered within the 1st min following the fatiguing MVC. When neuromuscular fatigue was induced by tetanic motor point stimulation of the TA, TMS-induced MEP amplitudes remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the observed decrease in MEP amplitude represents a focal reduction of cortical excitability following a fatiguing motor task and may be caused by intracortical and/or subcortical inhibitory mechanisms.", "pages": "550-3"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Peripheral and central conduction in n-hexane polyneuropathy.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "7533720", "authors": ["Oge, AM", "Yazici, J", "Boyaciyan, A", "Eryildiz, D", "Ornek, I", "Konyalio\u011flu, R", "Cengiz, S", "Ok\u015fak, OZ", "Asar, S", "Baslo, A"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the function of the dorsolateral frontal cortex in a delayed response task in 10 normal volunteers.

We have investigated the afferent neurogram, muscular activity and mechanical responses while subjects restrained, with a precision grip, an object subjected to pulling loads directed away from the hand. At unpredictable times 'ramp-and-hold' loads of 1 N were delivered at a rate of ca 80 N s-1. The load ramp produced a sharp increase in multiunit activity recorded from cutaneous afferents of the median nerve. The first response in the EMG of distal hand muscles commenced at 51 +/- 2.4 ms (mean +/- S.D.); a further steep increase in activity began about 20 ms later, and this was associated with a marked augmentation of the grip force increase. 2. In four subjects, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the contralateral motor cortex in 1000 out of a total of 1500 loading trials. The time of the stimulus was randomly selected to occur either at one of nine defined points (separated by 20 ms) before and after the computer command triggering the load force increase, or during steady periods of grip. 3. In most hand and arm muscles, there was a powerful facilitation of the short-latency EMG responses evoked by TMS delivered 40-140 ms after the load force command. The amplitudes of the largest responses (TMS delivered at 80-100 ms) were 850% higher on average than those observed when subjects gripped the unloaded object or when they restrained the statically loaded object. This large modulation was only obtained with stimulus intensities that were subthreshold in the relaxed subject. 4. The modulation was not simply a reflection of the time-varying level of motoneuronal activity during the loading trial. In most muscles, changes in the amplitude of the TMS-evoked responses were disproportionately larger than the corresponding modulation of the background EMG activity. At its maximum, the modulation in the TMS-evoked response was nearly 300% larger. Furthermore, the strength of the TMS-evoked responses did not strictly co-vary with amplitude of background EMG, i.e. inverse relationships were seen. 5. Since motor responses to the loading of the object depend on cutaneous afferent input from the gripping digits, the results demonstrate an interaction between the effects of these inputs and those of TMS. A possible site of this interaction is the primary motor cortex; the strong modulation of the responses to TMS could reflect variation in the excitability of cortical neurons mediated by the cutaneous afferent input. However, such excitability changes lagged the predicted onset of cortical excitation in a manner suggesting that the earliest 20 ms of the subjects' EMG responses to the load increase are subcortical in origin. In contrast, the results are consistent with a cortical mediation of the subsequent powerful boosting of the EMG responses associated with the robust grip force response.", "pages": "550-3"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Effects of droperidol, pentobarbital, and ketamine on myogenic transcranial magnetic motor-evoked responses in humans.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "21551793", "authors": ["Kalkman, CJ", "Drummond, JC", "Patel, PM", "Sano, T", "Chesnut, RM"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Electrophysiological findings of 27 males with industrial n-hexane polyneuropathy (HPNP) are presented.

In clinical application a reduced MEP/M wave amplitude ratio had a higher correlation with hyperreflexia than did a delayed MEP onset latency. The inhibitory period (IP) which is a transient suppression of muscle action potentials following motor evoked potentials (MEP) by magnetic cortical stimulation is caused primarily by inhibitory process in the motor cortex, because the duration of IP did not depend on the amplitude of MEPs, MEP distribution over the motor cortex or severity of voluntary contraction. Furthermore, the IP was shorter and the amplitude of MEP was increased when ipsilateral motor cortex stimulation to the thenar muscle preceded the contralateral cortex stimulation.

There were also bursts of EMG activity in the contralateral latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and abdominal muscles, which were assumed to be 'associated postural adjustments'. The same bilateral pattern of muscle activity occurred in a deafferented subject. 2. When subjects abducted the left arm rapidly, magnetic stimulation over the left motor cortex delayed the onset of the EMG burst in the right latissimus dorsi relative to the initial burst in the left deltoid. When subjects abducted the right arm rapidly, magnetic stimulation over the left motor cortex delayed the onset of the initial EMG burst in the right deltoid relative to the burst in the left latissimus. In each case, the delay of an EMG burst was greatest (about 80 ms) when the stimulus was given just before the burst was expected to occur. The inhibition of voluntary movements by transcranial stimulation was not associated with a reduction in the excitability of spinal motoneurons. 3.

The central latency of the cutaneous-induced depression of the discharge of single motor units in biceps brachii (C5-C6) was shorter by about 1 ms than that of the more caudal wrist and finger extensor motor units.

Modulation of the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) produced in the target muscle during rTMS showed a pattern of inhibitory and excitatory effects which depended on the rTMS frequency and intensity. With the magnetic coil situated over the optimal scalp position for activating the abductor pollicis brevis, rTMS led to spread of excitation, as evident from the induction of progressively larger MEPs in the other muscles. The number of pulses inducing this spread of excitation decreased with increasing rTMS frequency and intensity. Latency of the MEPs produced in the other muscles during the spread of excitation was significantly longer than that produced by single-pulse TMS applied to the optimal scalp positions for their activation. The difference in MEP latency could be explained by a delay in intracortical conduction along myelinated cortico-cortical pathways. Following rTMS, a 3-4 min period of increased excitability was demonstrated by an increase in the amplitude of MEPs produced in the target muscles by single-pulse TMS. Nevertheless, repeated rTMS trains applied 1 min apart led to similar modulation of the responses and to spread of excitation after approximately the same number of pulses.

The duration of the suppression ranged from 8 to 26 ms. 3. A circular stimulating coil was used to determine threshold intensity for excitation and suppression of contraction of thenar muscles in response to TMS at different locations over the motor cortex. The locations for lowest threshold excitation coincided with those for lowest threshold suppression. Suppression was elicited at a lower threshold than excitation at all locations. 4. A figure-of-eight stimulating coil was positioned over the left motor cortex at the lowest threshold point for excitation of the right thenar muscles. The orientation for the lowest threshold excitatory and inhibitory responses was the same for all subjects. That orientation induced a stimulating current travelling in an antero-medial direction. Suppression was invariably elicited at lower thresholds than excitation. 5. When antagonistic muscles (second and third dorsal interosseus) were co-contracted, TMS evoked coincident suppression of voluntary EMG in the two muscles without prior excitation of either muscle. This suggests that the suppression is not mediated via corticospinal activation of spinal interneurones. 6. Test responses to electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord were evoked in both relaxed and activated thenar muscles. In the relaxed muscle, prior TMS at an intensity that would suppress voluntary activity failed to influence the test responses, suggesting absence of inhibition at a spinal level. However, in the activated muscle, prior TMS could reduce the test response. This may be explained by disfacilitation of motoneurones due to inhibition of corticospinal output. 7. We propose that suppression of voluntary muscle activity by TMS is due in large part to activation of a mechanism within the motor cortex that reduces the corticospinal output to the muscle. It is concluded that TMS evokes excitation and inhibition via neuronal structures lying close to one another and having similar orientations.", "pages": "550-3"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation in diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia].", "issue": "4", "pmid": "6499981", "authors": ["Kotterba, S", "Tegenthoff, M", "Malin, JP"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Der Nervenarzt", "abstract": "A patient suffering for an ischemic \"locked-in\" syndrome following a subarachnoid hemorrhage, was evaluated with brain stem acoustic evoked potentials (BAEPs), short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs).
