The hypothesis that an enduring change in excitability in the cortical output circuitry can be induced in the human motor cortex by a paired-stimulation protocol was tested. Low-frequency median nerve stimulation was paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the optimal cranial site for stimulating the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB). This protocol induced an increase in the amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the resting APB as well as a prolongation of the silent period measured in the precontracted APB following TMS; amplitudes of MEPs measured in voluntary contraction remained unchanged. Experiments testing the excitability of spinal motoneurons using F-wave studies and electrical stimulation of the brainstem suggested that the site of the plastic changes was within the motor cortex. The increases in resting amplitudes and silent period duration were conditionally dependent on the timing between the afferent and the magnetic stimulation in that they were present when events elicited by afferent and magnetic stimulation were synchronous at the level of the motor cortex. Plasticity induced by paired stimulation evolved rapidly (within 30 min), was persistent (minimum duration 30-60 min) yet reversible, and was topographically specific. This combination of features and the similarity to properties of induced enduring changes in synaptic efficacy, as elucidated in animal studies, leads us to propose that the induced plasticity may represent a signature of associative long-term potentiation of cortical synapses or closely related neuronal mechanisms in the human cortex.", "pages": "572-84"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Changes in motor cortex excitability during ipsilateral hand muscle activation in humans.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10680571", "authors": ["Muellbacher, W", "Facchini, S", "Boroojerdi, B", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To test whether unilateral hand muscle activation involves changes in ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) excitability.", "pages": "572-84"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Electroencephalographic measurement of motor cortex control of muscle activity in humans.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10680569", "authors": ["Mima, T", "Steger, J", "Schulman, AE", "Gerloff, C", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right hemisphere was used to evoke motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the resting left abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in 9 normal volunteers.

To study the somatotopic organization of sensorimotor integration we applied electrical peripheral conditioning stimuli to a digit located near (homotopic stimulation) or distant from (heterotopic stimulation) relaxed or isometrically contracted intrinsic hand muscles at variable time intervals prior to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Cutaneous stimulation has previously been shown to modulate the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) and to shorten the duration of the silent period (SP) evoked by TMS. In relaxed target muscles the time-dependent modulation of TMS-evoked motor responses by homotopic conditioning stimulation differed from modulation by heterotopic stimulation. Similar differences in the modulation pattern evoked by homotopic and heterotopic conditioning stimulation were observed for two distinct target muscles of the hand (abductor digiti minimi, abductor pollicis brevis muscle). Differences in modulation were maximal when the conditioning stimulation was applied 25-30 ms and 150-200 ms prior to TMS. Comparison of the modulation of the amplitudes of MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and the modulation of those evoked by TMS suggests that differences between homotopic and heterotopic stimulation originate subcortically at 25- to 30-ms and, at least partially, cortically at 150- to 200-ms interstimulus intervals. In isometrically contracted intrinsic hand muscles the degree to which the SP was shortened reflected the location and the timing of the conditioning stimulus. Shortening was maximal when the conditioning stimulus was applied nearest to the contracted target muscle and 20 ms prior to the test stimulus. In contrast to the SP duration, the MEP size in voluntarily contracted target muscles was unaffected by the location of the conditioning stimulus. The somatotopic gradient of SP shortening was abolished when the two target muscles were simultaneously activated isometrically.

Two distinct types of potentials were evoked in anterior digastric with a figure-of-eight coil. A short-latency (3 ms) response appeared bilaterally on the surface electromyogram (EMG), but only ipsilaterally on intramuscular recordings: this was the result of direct stimulation of the ipsilateral trigeminal motor root. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in the anterior digastric muscles at variable onset latencies of around 10 ms by stimulation of scalp areas antero-lateral to the area for the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand. These were evoked bilaterally in relaxed anterior digastric muscles in six of the seven subjects. In the other subject, the responses in the relaxed muscle were exclusively ipsilateral. However, when the anterior digastric muscles were contracted, the responses were bilateral in all subjects. TCMS and spike-triggered averaging revealed that the bilateral responses were not due to the branching of axons from individual digastric motoneurones to muscles on each side. Because the digastric motor nucleus may contain separate populations of ipsi- and contralateral projecting motoneurones, it was necessary to study single motor-unit responses to TCMS to demonstrate a bilateral corticobulbar projection. The responses of 17 single motor units in the anterior digastric muscle to TCMS were recorded. All were activated by contralateral stimulation. Approximately 80% were also activated by ipsilateral TCMS, although one well-characterised motor unit was inhibited by ipsilateral TCMS. When bilateral activation was present, the ipsilateral responses were more secure than the contralateral responses, which may indicate an additional interneurone in the pathway to the contralateral motoneurone. The major conclusions from this study are that (1) the cortical representation of the anterior digastric muscle is antero-lateral to hand muscles; (2) the cortical projection to the anterior digastric muscles is bilateral; (3) the corticobulbar projection is stronger contralaterally than ipsilaterally but may involve at least one additional synapse; and (4) anterior digastric motoneurones do not branch to innervate the muscles bilaterally.", "pages": "572-84"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Proceedings of the International Symposium on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.

The first study confirmed that the rate of increase in the amplitude of EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with voluntary activation of the muscles was significantly greater in a hand muscle (first dorsal interosseous, 1DI) than in biceps, which was in turn greater than that for deltoid.

The voluntary activation of a pair of low-threshold single motor units (SMUs) in 1DI and deltoid was compared with their response to TMS. In both muscles only a small amount of additional effort was required to recruit the second SMU; increments were typically within 1% of maximum voluntary contraction, as assessed from EMG measurements. Subjects were asked to voluntarily discharge the lower threshold SMU at a steady rate, and then the threshold of responses of this SMU and that of the second unit to TMS were determined. In 1DI, only small increments in TMS intensity above the threshold for the first SMU were required to activate the second unit [mean 1.4% maximum stimulator output (MSO), SD +/- 1.0%, n = 7 subjects]. In contrast, in deltoid a significantly greater intensity increase was needed (mean 6%, SD +/- 1.2%, MSO n = 7, P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained when TMS thresholds of motor unit pairs were assessed in relaxed subjects. These experiments support the hypothesis that the fast corticospinal input that can be activated by TMS is of greater importance for the voluntary activation of hand than of shoulder muscles. This hypothesis served as a basis for testing deltoid responses in three stroke patients. In two patients smaller responses to TMS were obtained on the affected side than on the unaffected side during the production of equivalent voluntary contractions, suggesting that the patients achieved these contractions using inputs other than the fast corticospinal elements excited by TMS.", "pages": "572-84"}, {"volume": "174", "title": "Reduced cortical excitability in depression.

Supplement", "abstract": "Intracortical excitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is impaired. The effectiveness of the glutamate antagonist riluzole (Rilutek, Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer) in ALS has been shown in clinical studies. In healthy subjects it modifies intracortical excitability in a frequently used double-stimulus paradigm of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Under riluzole intracortical inhibition is enhanced in healthy individuals, although not always significantly, whereas intracortical facilitation has been described as reduced [10, 11]. We wanted to find out whether riluzole affects and potentially rebalances impaired intracortical excitability in ALS. We, therefore, enrolled 13 patients with clinically and electromyographically confirmed ALS into this study. Five patients had to be excluded because motor thresholds were too high to get reliable motor evoked potentials (MEPs). In the remaining 8 patients, mean age was 59.9 +/- 11.9 years (+/- standard deviation) and mean symptom duration 9.6 +/- 2.5 months. Intracortical excitability was assessed before and 1.5 hours after the first intake of a loading dose of 100 mg of riluzole using a conventional paired-pulse TMS paradigm with interstimulus intervals (ISI) ranging from 1-30 ms and intensities adjusted to yield MEPs of 1.0 mV for test pulses and of 90% active motor threshold for conditioning pulses. Patients' baseline results were compared to those of 9 age-matched, healthy control subjects. Before drug intake, motor thresholds did not differ between groups, but there was significantly less intracortical inhibition in the ALS patient group. Riluzole intake did not significantly alter motor thresholds or intracortical excitability in the ALS patients. We conclude that riluzole does not immediately influence intracortical excitability in ALS. Our results are in contrast to the findings of Stefan et al (1998) [14] where a partial normalization of intracortical inhibition in ALS was observed after at least 5 days of drug intake.

Activation of descending corticospinal tracts with transmastoid electrical stimuli has been used to assess changes in the behaviour of motoneurones after voluntary contractions.

Following a sustained MVC of the elbow flexors lasting 5-120 s there was an immediate reduction of the response to transmastoid stimulation to about half of the control value. The response recovered to control levels after about 2 min. This was evident even when the size of the responses was adjusted to accommodate changes in the maximal muscle action potential (assessed with supramaximal stimuli at the brachial plexus). 3. To determine whether the post-contraction depression required activity in descending motor paths, motoneurones were activated by supramaximal tetanic stimulation of the musculocutaneous nerve for 10 s. This did not depress the response to transmastoid stimulation. 4. Following a sustained MVC of 120 s duration, the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex gradually declined to a minimal level by about 2 min and remained depressed for more than 10 min. 5. Additional studies were performed to check that the activation of descending tracts by transmastoid stimulation was likely to involve excitation of direct corticospinal paths.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the influence of an isotonic compared to an isometric experimental condition. The SP after transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscle was up to 130% longer when elicited during a maintain-position (isotonic) task as compared to a maintain-force task (isometric) when stimulus intensities of 5% to 25% above threshold were used. The mean SP duration in these muscles was positively correlated to the mean contraction time in both tasks. However, no such relationship was observed for the trials within the individual subjects. We speculate that the invariably longer SP of the maintain-position task was due to the different \"motor set\" which predictively determined the muscle behavior after the stimulus. In the maintain-position trials, the stimulus-induced long-lasting flexion movement is counteracted by a motor set aiming to relax the elbow flexors immediately after the stimulus. In the maintain-force task the contraction twitch is short and a force drop below the preset level must be prevented by a motor set aiming to contract the elbow flexors immediately after the stimulus. The latter may increase the synaptic input to the motoneuron pool and facilitate the reoccurrence of the electromyogram terminating the SP. At high-stimulus intensities the SP duration increased in both tasks, and the task-dependent differences disappeared.

In order to clarify its nature and the pathway responsible for its generation, we studied 27 patients with discrete lesions in the brain (16, 9 and 2 patients with lesions in the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem, respectively). Facilitation was absent in patients with lesions affecting the primary sensorimotor area, whereas it was preserved in patients with cortical lesions that spared this area. Facilitation was abolished with thalamic lesions that totally destroyed the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL), but was preserved with lesions that at least partly spared it. Lesions of the spinothalamic tract did not impair facilitation. The size of the N20-P25 component of the somatosensory evoked potential showed a mild correlation with the amount of facilitation. The facilitation is mainly mediated by sensory inputs that ascend the dorsal column and reach the cortex through VPL. These are fed into the primary motor area via the primary sensory area, especially its anterior portion, corresponding to Brodmann areas 3 and 1 (possibly also area 2), without involving other cortical regions. The spinothalamic tract and direct thalamic inputs into the motor cortex do not contribute much to this effect. Some patients could generate voluntary movements despite the absence of the facilitatory effect. The present method will enable us to investigate in humans the function of one of the somatotopically organized sensory feedback input pathways into the motor cortex, and will be useful in monitoring ongoing finger movements during object manipulation.", "pages": "572-84"}, {"volume": "272", "title": "Deficient motor control in children with tic disorder: evidence from transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10590945", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Oreja-Guevara, C", "Cohen, LG", "Tegenthoff, M", "Hallett, M", "Malin, JP"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "This report describes the clinical and pathological characteristics of two patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis (LHy) and two with infundibuloneurohypophysitis (INHy). Two of the patients were women and two were men, and their ages were between 27 and 38 years old. This disease was not associated with either pregnancy or the postpartum period in the female patients. Two of the patients presented with diabetes insipidus, one with panhypopituitarism and right abducens paralysis and one with headache and galactorrhea. At presentation three of the patients had mild to moderate hyperprolactinemia and one had low prolactin levels. All four had abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): focal nodular enlarging of the infundibulum and normal hypophysis in one, expanding sellar masses in two, and diffusely thickened stalk with slightly enlarged pituitary gland in one. Three cases showed no sign of adenohypophysial deficiency with stimulation tests. One patient had associated chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Of the first three patients, one patient underwent transcranial and two underwent transnasal transsphenoidal (TNTS) surgery for mass excisions since they were thought to have pituitary tumors. Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal biopsy was performed in the last one with a suspicion of LHy. The pathological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed lymphocytic infiltration. Hyperprolactinemia resolved with surgery in two patients and one developed diabetes insipidus as a complication. We conclude that LHy and infundibuloneurohypophysitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the mass lesions of the sellar region and also should be kept in the mind for the etiopathogenesis of cases of hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea and diabetes insipidus.
