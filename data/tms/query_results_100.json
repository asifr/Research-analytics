Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes typically increase in muscles which would be active during the execution of the observed action. This 'motor resonance' effect is thought to result from activity in mirror neuron regions, which enhance the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) via cortico-cortical pathways. The importance of TMS intensity has not yet been recognised in this area of research. Low-intensity TMS predominately activates corticospinal neurons indirectly, whereas high-intensity TMS can directly activate corticospinal axons. This indicates that motor resonance effects should be more prominent when using low-intensity TMS. A related issue is that TMS is typically applied over a single optimal scalp position (OSP) to simultaneously elicit MEPs from several muscles. Whether this confounds results, due to differences in the manner that TMS activates spatially separate cortical representations, has not yet been explored. In the current study, MEP amplitudes, resulting from single-pulse TMS applied over M1, were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles during the observation of simple finger abductions. We tested if the TMS intensity (110% vs. 130% resting motor threshold) or stimulating position (FDI-OSP vs. ADM-OSP) influenced the magnitude of the motor resonance effects. Results showed that the MEP facilitation recorded in the FDI muscle during the observation of index-finger abductions was only detected using low-intensity TMS. In contrast, changes in the OSP had a negligible effect on the presence of motor resonance effects in either the FDI or ADM muscles. These findings support the hypothesis that MN activity enhances M1 excitability via cortico-cortical pathways and highlight a methodological framework by which the neural underpinnings of action observation can be further explored.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "31", "title": "TMS and tDCS in post-stroke aphasia: Integrating novel treatment approaches with mechanisms of plasticity.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "19160510", "authors": ["Torres, J", "Drebing, D", "Hamilton, R"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "The aim of the study reported here was to examine the safety and effectiveness of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in elderly patients with depression.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Postoperative analgesic effect of transcranial direct current stimulation in lumbar spine surgery: a randomized control trial.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "18926836", "authors": ["Dubois, PE", "Ossemann, M", "de Fays, K", "De Bue, P", "Gourdin, M", "Jamart, J", "Vandermeeren, Y"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The Clinical journal of pain", "abstract": "Sixty-five depressed elderly patients received rTMS over their left prefrontal cortex for 6 days per week, from Monday to Saturday, for 3 weeks.

We examined the effect of a single right DLPFC HF-rTMS session on commission errors, mean reaction times (RTs) and intra-individual reaction time variability (IIRTV) during a Go-NoGo task (50% Go/50% NoGo condition) in 29 alcohol-dependent patients.

The response rate of rTMS for depression is modest, motivating the search for biomarkers predictive of treatment response. METHODS: Thirteen patients (mean age 45 years, three males) with current major depression resistant to at least one antidepressant trial in the current episode were treated with a 25 day course of rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Resting state cerebral perfusion was measured prior to the first day of treatment and after the final day of treatment. Treatment response was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 24 Item (Ham-D). Baseline cerebral perfusion was compared in responders to non-responders. In addition, post-treatment cerebral perfusion was compared to pre-treatment in responders as well as in non-responders. RESULTS: Six individuals responded to rTMS. Responders had greater resting state blood flow in the left DLPFC (the target site) at baseline compared to non-responders. Non-responders showed greater baseline activity in the left medial frontal cortex. Neither group exhibited changes during treatment, nor did the combined group. LIMITATIONS: This study suffers from low sample size and resulting small responder and non-responder subgroups. The sample was not balanced to gender. A normal control group was not included. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is the first study to compare pre-treatment brain perfusion patterns of depressed individuals who responded to rTMS to those who did not. Our results suggest stronger left DLPFC perfusion in responders and stronger medial prefrontal perfusion in non-responders both at baseline and post-treatment.

Here we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left and right temporal poles before asking healthy individuals to perform a speeded word-to-picture matching task using familiar people and common objects as stimuli. We manipulated two widely used semantic variables, namely the semantic distance and the familiarity of stimuli, to assess whether the semantic organization of familiar people knowledge is similar to that of common objects. For both objects and faces we reliably found semantic distance and familiarity effects, with less accurate and slower responses for stimulus pairs that were more closely related and less familiar. However, the effects of semantic variables differed across categories, with semantic distance effects larger for objects and familiarity effects larger for faces, suggesting that objects and faces might share a partially comparable organization of their semantic representations. The application of rTMS to the left temporal pole modulated, for both categories, semantic distance, but not familiarity effects, revealing that accessing object and face concepts might rely on overlapping processes within left anterior temporal regions. Crucially, rTMS of the left temporal pole affected only the recognition of pairs of stimuli that could be discriminated at specific levels of categorization (e.g., two kitchen tools or two famous persons), with no effect for discriminations at either superordinate or individual levels. Conversely, rTMS of the right temporal pole induced an overall slowing of reaction times that positively correlated with the visual similarity of the stimuli, suggesting a more perceptual rather than semantic role of the right anterior temporal regions.

Therefore, we assessed neural correlates of dual and unihemispheric anodal tDCS effects in 20 healthy older subjects in a randomized, sham-controlled study using a cross-over design. Participants underwent tDCS and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging during a choice reaction time task and at rest. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allowed us to relate potential functional changes to structural parameters. The resting-state analysis demonstrated that, compared with sham, both dual and anodal tDCS decreased connectivity of right hippocampus and M1 (contralateral to the anode position) while increasing connectivity in the left prefrontal cortex. Notably, dual but not anodal tDCS enhanced connectivity of the left dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, dual tDCS yielded stronger activations in bilateral M1 compared with anodal tDCS when participants used either their left or right hand during the motor task. The corresponding tDCS-induced changes in laterality of activations were related to the microstructural status of transcallosal motor fibers. In conclusion, our results suggest that the impact of bihemispheric tDCS cannot be explained by mere add-on effects of anodal and concurrent cathodal stimulation, but rather by complex network modulations involving interhemispheric interactions and areas associated with motor control in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Effect of Serotonin on Paired Associative Stimulation-Induced Plasticity in the Human Motor Cortex.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16190904", "authors": ["Batsikadze, G", "Paulus, W", "Kuo, MF", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Since GABAA-mediated intracortical inhibition has been shown to underlie plastic changes throughout the lifespan from development to aging, here, the aging motor system was used as a model to analyze the interdependence of plastic alterations within the inhibitory motorcortical network and level of behavioral performance.

The stop-signal task (SST) is an experimental model for this behavior. Participants initiate a saccade towards a target and occasionally have to try to stop the impending saccade if a stop signal occurs. Prior research using a version of this paradigm for limb-movements (hand, leg), as well as for speech, has shown that rapidly stopping action leads to apparently global suppression of the motor system, as indexed by the Corticospinal Excitability (CSE) of task-unrelated effectors in studies with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of M1. Here, we measured CSE from the hand with high temporal precision while participants made saccades, and while they successfully and unsuccessfully stopped these saccades in response to a stop signal. We show that 50 ms before the estimated time at which a saccade is successfully stopped there is reduced CSE for the hand, which was task irrelevant. This shows that rapidly stopping eye movements also has global motor effects. We speculate that this arises because rapidly stopping eye movements, like skeleto-motor movements, is possibly achieved via input to the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia, with a putatively broad suppressive effect on thalamocortical drive. Since recent studies suggest that this suppressive effect could also impact non-motor representations, the current finding points to a possible mechanistic basis for some kinds of distractibility: abrupt onset stimuli will interrupt ongoing processing by generating global motor and non-motor effects.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "71", "title": "[Electroconvulsive therapy in schizophrenia].", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17499164", "authors": ["Takebayashi, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Nihon rinsho.

Reports of the subjective visual features of phosphenes were systematically collected and analyzed. We found that selective stimulation of V1 and V2 are equally capable of generating phosphenes, as demonstrated by comparable phosphene thresholds and similar characteristics of phosphene shape, color, and texture. However, the phosphenes induced by V1 stimulation were systematically perceived as brighter than the phosphenes induced by the stimulation of V2. Thus, these results suggest that V1 and V2 have a similar capability to produce conscious percepts.

METHODS: Healthy nonepilepsy women and women with generalized and focal epilepsy were investigated during ovulatory (n = 11, 46, and 43, respectively) and anovulatory (n = 9, 42, and 41) cycles. Patients were divided based on seizure pattern into catamenial (C1 = perimenstrual, C2 = periovulatory, C3 = luteal seizure exacerbation), noncatamenial, and seizure free. Cortical excitability was assessed using motor threshold (MT) and paired pulse stimulation at short (2-15 milliseconds) and long (100-300 milliseconds) interstimulus intervals twice, at the (1) late follicular and (2) mid luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. RESULTS: In controls, cortical excitability was greatest in the follicular study, where intracortical facilitation was increased (p < 0.05). The opposite was seen in women with epilepsy, where intracortical facilitation was greatest and intracortical inhibition was least in the luteal studies (p < 0.05). There were no differences between the ovulatory and anovulatory groups in any of the cohorts. No changes were observed in MT. INTERPRETATION: Nonhormonal factors are involved in the cyclicity of cortical excitability across the menstrual cycle. Normal menstrual cycle variations in cortical excitability are altered in a similar pattern in ovulatory and anovulatory women with epilepsy regardless of seizure patterns. The underlying neural changes associated with epilepsy may alter responses to sex hormones. This may be an important underlying mechanism for catamenial seizure clustering.

Hydrocephalus is a brain development disorder related to an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system. The functional relevance of cortical structural changes described in this disease is largely unexplored in human. We investigated cortical excitability using multimodal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a case of congenital hydrocephalus with almost no neurological signs. Methods: A caucasian 40 years old, ambidextrous and multilingual woman affected by occult spina bifida and congenital symmetrical hydrocephalous underwent a TMS study. The intracortical and interhemispheric paired pulse paradigms were used, together with the mapping technique. Results: No significant differences were found in the resting motor thresholds between the two hemispheres. Instead, the intracortical excitability curves were statistically different between the two hemispheres (with short intracortical inhibition (SICI) being strongly reduced and intracortical facilitation (ICF) enhanced in the right one), and the interhemispheric curves showed a general hyper-excitability on the right hemisphere (when conditioned by the left one) and a general hypo-excitability in the left hemisphere (when conditioned by the right one). It is noteworthy that an asymmetric right hemisphere (RH) change of excitability was observed by means of mapping technique. Conclusion: We hypothesize that in this ambidextrous subject, the observed RH hyper-excitability could represent a mechanism of plasticity to preserve functionality of specific brain areas possibly devoted to some special skills, such as multilingualism.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Left parietal TMS disturbs priming between symbolic and non-symbolic number representations.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "23709353", "authors": ["Sasanguie, D", "G\u00f6bel, SM", "Reynvoet, B"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to determine 1) if motor evoked potential (MEP) response latencies and central motor conduction time (CMCT) are significantly correlated with lower extremity (LE) length or height, and 2) determine if MEP response latencies and CMCT are different between sexes among healthy adults. A cross-sectional, descriptive laboratory design was used.

A secondary aim was to test the sensitivity of the method to a change in muscle length by comparing the relaxation rate of the plantar flexor muscles with the gastrocnemius at short and long lengths. Seven subjects performed 21 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVCs) of the dorsiflexors (DF) and plantar flexors with a knee angle of either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 (PF90 and PF180, respectively).

MVC torque was greater, and the rate of relaxation was faster for PF180 compared to PF90. The main findings are that TMS can be used to measure relaxation rates of lower limb muscles, and these rates are robust provided the stimulus intensity is above a critical threshold.

In principal accordance, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors enhance long-term potentiation-like plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in humans. As other neuromodulators have discernable effects on different kinds of plasticity in humans, here we were interested to explore the impact of serotonin on paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced plasticity, which induces a more focal kind of plasticity, as compared with tDCS, shares some features with spike timing-dependent plasticity, and is thought to be relative closely related to learning processes. In this single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, we administered a single dose of 20\u2009mg citalopram or placebo medication and applied facilitatory- and excitability-diminishing PAS to the left motor cortex of 14 healthy subjects.

After citalopram administration, inhibitory PAS-induced after-effects were abolished and excitatory PAS-induced after-effects were enhanced trendwise, as compared with the respective placebo conditions. These results show that serotonin modulates PAS-induced neuroplasticity by shifting it into the direction of facilitation, which might help to explain mechanism of positive therapeutic effects of serotonin in learning and medical conditions characterized by enhanced inhibitory or reduced facilitatory plasticity, including depression and stroke.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 5 June 2013; doi:10.1038/npp.2013.127.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Long Lasting Effects of Daily Theta Burst rTMS Sessions in the Human Amblyopic\u00a0Cortex.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23707586", "authors": ["Clavagnier, S", "Thompson, B", "Hess, RF"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "To make a decision may rely on accumulating evidence in favor of one alternative until a threshold is reached.

Moreover, the LLSR modulation also decreased when TMS was applied over SMAp 150ms before the perturbation, indicating that anticipatory processes taking place in SMAp participate to the LLSR modulation. In addition, TMS applied over SMAp elicited Motor-Evoked Potentials (MEPs) whose latency and shape were similar to MEPs evoked by TMS over M1, suggesting that they are due to direct corticospinal projections from SMAp.

METHODS: Stimulation consisted of 15 sessions of rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Clinical evaluations included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline, after 3 weeks of treatment, and 1 month and 3 months after the last session. RESULTS: Data from 93 patients issued from the 178 patients active file were analyzed. The antidepressant effect observed in the two age groups (<65 and \u226565) did not differ at the end of the treatment and 3 months later, with a comparable number of responders (50% decrease in HDRS score from baseline) (53.3% for age <65 versus 46.7% for age \u226565, p=0.51).

In a first experiment, hand and foot motor areas were stimulated by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation, while participants viewed a typical hand action (grasping) or a nonspecific action (stepping over an object) performed by either a hand or a foot. Hand motor evoked potentials (MEPs) increased for grasping and stepping over actions performed by the hand and for grasping actions performed by the foot. Conversely, foot MEPs increased only for actions performed by the foot. In a second experiment, participants viewed a typical hand action (grasping a pencil) and a typical foot action (pressing a foot-pedal) performed by either a hand or a foot. Again, hand MEPs increased not only during the observation of both actions performed by the hand but also for grasping actions performed by the foot. Foot MEPs increased not only during the observation of grasping and pressing actions performed by the foot but also for pressing actions performed by the hand. This evidence indicates that motor activations by action observation occur also in the muscles typically used to perform the observed action, even when the action is executed by an unusual effector, hence suggesting a double coding of observed actions: a strict somatotopic coding and an action goal coding based on the observer's motor expertise.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The aims of this study were to assess whether cTBS of the visual cortex could improve contrast sensitivity in adults with amblyopia and whether repeated sessions of cTBS would lead to more pronounced and/or longer lasting effects. METHODS: cTBS was delivered to the visual cortex while patients viewed a high contrast stimulus with their non-amblyopic eye. This manipulation was designed to bias the effects of cTBS toward inputs from the amblyopic eye. Contrast sensitivity was measured before and after stimulation. The effects of one cTBS session were measured in five patients and the effects of five consecutive daily sessions were measured in four patients. Three patients were available for follow-up at varying intervals after the final session. RESULTS: cTBS improved amblyopic eye contrast sensitivity to high spatial frequencies (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and there was a cumulative improvement across sessions with asymptotic improvement occurring after 2 daily sessions of stimulation. The contrast sensitivity improvements were stable over a period of up to 78\u00a0days.

Furthermore, we recruited one subject for whom the cSPs were induced with several stimulation intensities, and those cSPs were analysed manually by two of the authors as well as using the automated routine.

We examined changes in the amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), recorded from hand and arm muscles, as an index of activity within the motor system. Musicians and non-musicians rated groove similarly. MEP results showed that high-groove music modulated corticospinal excitability, whereas no difference occurred between low-groove music and noise. More specifically, musicians' MEPs were larger with high-groove than low-groove music, and this effect was especially pronounced for on-beat compared to off-beat pulses. These results indicate that high-groove music increasingly engages the motor system, and the temporal modulation of corticospinal excitability with the beat could stem from tight auditory-motor links in musicians. Conversely, non-musicians' MEPs were smaller for high-groove than low-groove music, and there was no effect of on- versus off-beat pulses, potentially stemming from suppression of overt movement.

FD and MDF of the raw EMG epochs immediately before were compared with those obtained from epochs after the EMG silence. Changes in FD and MDF after spTMS were examined with three levels of muscle contraction corresponding to weak (20-40\u00a0%), moderate (40-60\u00a0%) and strong (60-80\u00a0% of maximal voluntary contraction) and three intensities of stimulation set at 10, 20 and 30\u00a0% above the resting motor threshold.

Finally, to discern the origin of FD changes between the CNS and muscle, we compared the effects of spTMS with the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) on FD and MDF. The results show that spTMS induced significant decrease in both FD and MDF of EMG signal after stimulation. PNS did not have any significant effects on FD nor MDF. Changes in TMS intensity did not have any significant effect on FD or MDF after stimulation nor had the strength of muscle contraction. However, increase in contraction strength decreased FD before stimulation but only between weak and moderate contraction. The results suggest that the effects of spTMS on corticospinal activity, underlying voluntary motor output, outlast the TMS stimulus.

The results showed that the peak amplitude and maximal rise slope of evoked single action potential (AP) were significantly increased after 14-d's rTMS treatment. Meanwhile, the AP threshold was significantly more depolarized in neurons after 14-d's rTMS treatment than neurons in control group that without rTMS treatment. The spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) frequency and amplitude of CA1 pyramidal neurons in groups with rTMS treatment (both 7d and 14d) were obviously increased compared with the age-matched control group. Furthermore, we found that electrophysiological properties of Na(+)-channel were markedly changed after rTMS treatment, including negative-shifted activation and inactivation curves, as well as fasten recovery rate. After rTMS application, the IA amplitude of K(+)-channel was reduced; the activation and inactivation curves of K(+)-channel were significantly shifted to right. Time constant of recovery from inactivation was also more rapid. Moreover, rTMS induced an obvious increment in the maximal current peak amplitude of Ca(2+)-channel.

RESULTS: Following phantom stimulation, the artifact resulting from different TMS machines (Magstim 200, Magventure MagPro R30 and X100) and pulse shapes (monophasic and biphasic) resulted in different artifact profiles. After accounting for differences between machines, TMS artifacts recovered within \u223c12\u00a0ms.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked activity in the prefrontal cortex may be associated with corticolimbic inhibitory circuits capable of decreasing pain perception. The present exploratory pilot study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of left prefrontal rTMS on brain activity and pain perception. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION.: Twenty-three healthy adults with no history of depression or chronic pain underwent an 8-minute thermal pain protocol with fMRI before and after a single rTMS session. Participants received 15 minutes of either real (N\u2009=\u200912) or sham (N\u2009=\u200911) 10\u2009Hz rTMS over the left prefrontal cortex (110% of resting motor threshold; 5 seconds on, 10 seconds off). RESULTS.: TMS was associated with a 13.30% decrease in pain ratings, while sham was associated with an 8.61% decrease (P\u2009=\u20090.04). TMS was uniquely associated with increased activity in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneous, right superior frontal gyrus, right insula, and bilateral postcentral gyrus. Activity in the right superior prefrontal gyrus was negatively correlated with pain ratings (r\u2009=\u2009-0.65, P\u2009=\u20090.02) in the real TMS group. CONCLUSIONS.: Findings suggest that prefrontal rTMS may be capable of activating inhibitory circuits involved with pain reduction.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "112", "title": "Outcome and rehabilitation after childhood stroke.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1197619", "authors": ["Ganesan, V"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "Unilateral perinatal brain injury may result in recruitment of ipsilateral projections originating in the unaffected hemisphere and development of unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP).
