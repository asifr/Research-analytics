In 12 right-handed healthy individuals, we applied 30 min of low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left rPMd to investigate the involvement of left rPMd and SMG in the rapid adjustment of actions guided by visuospatial cues. After rTMS, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while making spatially congruent button presses with the right or left index finger in response to a left- or right-sided target. Subjects were asked to covertly prepare motor responses as indicated by a directional cue presented 1 s before the target. On 20% of trials, the cue was invalid, requiring subjects to readjust their motor plan according to the target location. Compared with sham rTMS, real rTMS increased the number of correct responses in invalidly cued trials. After real rTMS, task-related activity of the stimulated left rPMd showed increased task-related coupling with activity in ipsilateral SMG and the adjacent anterior intraparietal area (AIP). Individuals who showed a stronger increase in left-hemispheric premotor-parietal connectivity also made fewer errors on invalidly cued trials after rTMS. The results suggest that rTMS over left rPMd improved the ability to dynamically adjust visuospatial response mapping by strengthening left-hemispheric connectivity between rPMd and the SMG-AIP region. These results support the notion that left rPMd and SMG-AIP contribute toward dynamic control of actions and demonstrate that low-frequency rTMS can enhance functional coupling between task-relevant brain regions and improve some aspects of motor performance.", "pages": "9216-23"}, {"volume": "206", "title": "Representing actions through their sound.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "20602092", "authors": ["Aglioti, SM", "Pazzaglia, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Actually, the depth of information processing at encoding predicts the accuracy of the subsequent episodic memory performance. When the incoming stimuli are analyzed in terms of their meaning (semantic, or deep, encoding), the memory performance is superior with respect to the case in which the same stimuli are analyzed in terms of their perceptual features (shallow encoding). As suggested by previous neuroimaging studies and by some preliminary findings with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the left prefrontal cortex may play a role in semantic processing requiring the allocation of working memory resources. However, it still remains unclear whether deep and shallow encoding share or not the same cortical networks, as well as how these networks contribute to the \"level of processing\" effect. To investigate the brain areas casually involved in this phenomenon, we applied event-related repetitive TMS (rTMS) during deep (semantic) and shallow (perceptual) encoding of words. Retrieval was subsequently tested without rTMS interference. RTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) abolished the beneficial effect of deep encoding on memory performance, both in terms of accuracy (decrease) and reaction times (increase). Neither accuracy nor reaction times were instead affected by rTMS to the right DLPFC or to an additional control site excluded by the memory process (vertex). The fact that online measures of semantic processing at encoding were unaffected suggests that the detrimental effect on memory performance for semantically encoded items took place in the subsequent consolidation phase. These results highlight the specific causal role of the left DLPFC among the wide left-lateralized cortical network engaged by long-term memory, suggesting that it probably represents a crucial node responsible for the improved memory performance induced by semantic processing.", "pages": "9216-23"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Lateralization of motor excitability during observation of bimanual signs.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "17911215", "authors": ["M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen, R", "Farmer, H", "Watkins, KE"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in the pathophysiology of major depression.

The multisensory visual field exploration training consisted in the practice of visual search through the systematic audio-visual stimulation of the visual field. Neurologically unimpaired participants performed a bimodal exploration training for 30 min, while simultaneously receiving anodal-excitatory PPC tDCS or sham tDCS. In two different experiments, the left and the right hemisphere were stimulated. Outcome measures included visual exploration speed at different time intervals during the training, and the post-training effects on tests assessing visual scanning and visuo-spatial orienting. Results show that PPC tDCS applied to the right, but not to the left, hemisphere increases the training-induced behavioural improvement of visual exploration, as compared to sham tDCS. In addition, right PPC tDCS brings about an improvement of covert visual orienting, in a task different from the visual search practice. In an additional experiment, we confirm that right parietal tDCS by itself, even without the associated training, can lead to enhancement of visual search.

In this sham-controlled, \"single blind\" crossover study, we examined whether one session of HF-rTMS could affect the HPA-system, when taking into account individual state anxiety scores based on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Twenty-four healthy rTMS na\u00efve females received one sham-controlled high frequency (HF)-rTMS session delivered on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been examined as a treatment tool for chronic tinnitus for several years trying to target hyperactivity/abnormal synchronization within the auditory cortex putatively underlying the auditory phantom percept. However, its exact impact on auditory cortical activity remains largely unknown. This study's objective was to systematically examine changes in auditory responses (N1, auditory steady-state response [aSSR]) measured by means of magnetoencephalography after single sessions of stimulation with different TMS paradigms. Subjects with chronic tinnitus (n = 10) underwent five sessions of rTMS in which they received one of five different stimulation protocols (1 Hz, individual alpha frequency, continuous theta burst stimulation [cTBS], intermittent theta burst stimulation [iTBS], and sham) in randomized order using a single-blind study design. Cortical steady-state responses to 40 Hz amplitude-modulated tones were measured before and after each magnetic stimulation protocol. The results demonstrate a reduction of the cortical response to the auditory steady-state stimulus after magnetic stimulation, whereas the N1 response was slightly enhanced or remained unchanged. Furthermore, reduction of the aSSR was driven by effects of iTBS, cTBS, and 1 Hz stimulation. Correspondingly, behavioral measures demonstrated the greatest reduction of tinnitus loudness after the respective rTMS protocols.

Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) has been shown to decrease before CE increases. Therefore we reasoned that, if SICI contributes to inhibitory control of voluntary movement during the preparatory phase, it would be larger in CRT than in SRT because of the need to keep the movement unreleased until the uncertainty resolves on which task is required. We measured changes in SICI and in CE at different time points preceding motor reaction in normal subjects. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) produced time-dependent changes in both SRT and CRT, with shortening when applied close to the presentation of the imperative signal (\"early\") and lengthening when applied near the expected reaction (\"late\"). In addition, at all stimulation time points, reaction time was shorter with ppTMS than that with spTMS, but there was no consistent association between the amount of SICI and reaction time changes. At early stimulation time points, CE was reduced in CRT but not in SRT. However, SICI in CRT was not different from SICI in SRT. At late stimulation time points, SICI decreased just before enhancement of CE. Our findings indicate that inhibitory circuits other than SICI are responsible for setting the level of CE at earlier parts of the reaction time period.

Low- and high-frequency vibrations activate separate classes of afferent units in the periphery. Low-frequency vibrations (2-100\u2003Hz) activate the type I fast adapting afferent units (FA-I), whereas high-frequency vibrations (60-1000\u2003Hz) preferentially activate the type II units (FA-II). Muscle spindles are also sensitive to high-frequency mechanical vibrations. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) generated in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be modulated by afferent signals. However, it is not clear whether these interactions take place at cortical or spinal cord levels. Methods:\u2002 Cerebrovascular attacks resulting in stroke generally affect both sensory and motor systems. In eight stroke patients with partial motor deficit in the first two weeks of the incident we studies the effects of low- (30\u2003Hz) and high- (130\u2003Hz) frequency mechanical vibrations on the MEPs obtained in response to TMS. Recordings from the abductor digiti minimi muscle were carried out by TMS of both lesioned and intact hemispheres. Six patients were tested again four to eight weeks after the initial assessment. The results also were compared with data obtained from eight control subjects. MEPs were evoked by 50% above threshold intensities and for each testing condition initially five control MEPs were recorded. This was followed by consecutive MEPs obtained during vibration (N= 5) and between vibrations (N= 5), and the traces were averaged and analyzed. Results:\u2002 In normal subjects both low- (30\u2003Hz) and high- (130\u2003Hz) frequency vibration resulted in shortening of MEP latencies. In patients, there was a similar effect on the affected side with 30\u2003Hz, but not with 130\u2003Hz. Stimulation of the intact hemisphere during high-frequency vibration in the second test revealed a latency shortening, which could be due to central reorganization. The amplitude of MEPs showed a stronger facilitation in the presence of low-frequency vibration in the early stage of stroke compared with normal subjects. However, in the second test the level of facilitation was reduced, indicating an effect at the cortical level.

To remedy this knowledge gap, we interrupted activity in the PPC, near the junction of the anterior intraparietal sulcus and the postcentral sulcus, using MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects localized touches delivered to different fingers. As the touches were delivered, subjects viewed a congruent touch video, an incongruent touch video, or no video.

This occurred despite a 40% greater improvement in peak thumb abduction acceleration (motor learning) for the right hand in young subjects compared with the left hand in young subjects (P < 0.04) and the right hand in old subjects (P < 0.01). Furthermore, no difference in use-dependent plasticity was observed between young and old adults, and SICI remained unchanged following ballistic training for both hands in all subjects. These findings suggest that there is greater strengthening of corticomotor circuits for control of the left compared with the right hand during simple ballistic thumb training and that an age-related decline in motor learning was observed only in the dominant hand. In contrast to previous studies, these data also indicate that young and old adults can demonstrate similar use-dependent corticomotor plasticity during this simple thumb-training task.", "pages": "9216-23"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Cerebellar TMS evokes a long latency motor response in the hand during a visually guided manual tracking task.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20598753", "authors": ["Hiraoka, K", "Horino, K", "Yagura, A", "Matsugi, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a possible treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer disease (AD).

We further demonstrated that LICI had different effects on cortical oscillations in the DLPFC compared with motor cortex. The purpose of this study was to establish the validity and reliability of TMS-EEG indices of CI and to replicate our previous findings in an extended sample. The validity of TMS-EEG was examined by evaluating its relationship to standard EMG measures of LICI and the CSP in the left motor cortex in 36 and 16 subjects, respectively. Test-retest reliability was examined in 14 subjects who returned for a repeat session within 7 days of the first session. LICI was applied to the left DLPFC in 30 subjects to compare LICI in the DLPFC with that in the motor cortex. In the motor cortex, EEG measures of LICI correlated with EMG measures of LICI and CSP. All indices of LICI showed high test-retest reliability in motor cortex and DLPFC. Gamma and beta oscillations were significantly inhibited in the DLPFC but not in the motor cortex, confirming previous findings in an extended sample.

Posterior alpha power is influenced by visual spatial attention via top-down control from higher order attention areas such as the frontal eye field. It covaries with visual cortex excitability, as tested through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and predicts the perceptual fate of a forthcoming visual stimulus. Yet, it is still unknown whether the nature of the relationship between this prestimulus alpha oscillation and upcoming perception is causal or only correlative. Here, we tested in the human brain whether the oscillation in the alpha band is causally shaping perception through directly stimulating visual areas via short trains of rhythmic TMS. We compared stimulation at alpha frequency (10 Hz) with two control frequencies in the theta (5 Hz) and beta bands (20 Hz), and assessed immediate perceptual outcomes. Target visibility was significantly modulated by alpha stimulation, relative to both control conditions. Alpha stimulation selectively impaired visual detection in the visual field opposite to the stimulated hemisphere, while enhancing detection ipsilaterally. These frequency-specific effects were observed both for stimulation over occipital and parietal areas of the left and right hemispheres and were short lived: they were observed by the end of the TMS train but were absent 3 s later.

Participants performed an auditory lexical decision task in which the orthographic consistency of spoken words was manipulated and repetitive TMS was used to interfere with either phonological or orthographic processing by stimulating left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) or left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC), respectively.

In the 1st experiment, participants practiced 3 rapid elbow flexion-extension tasks in either a blocked or random order, with learning assessed by a delayed retention test. TMS was delivered immediately after feedback during practice using a circular coil, centered over the contralateral M1. Each participant practiced with 1 of 3 TMS conditions: no TMS, real TMS, or sham TMS. Although no significant differences were observed between groups during acquisition, retention of the random group was better than the blocked group. The learning benefits of random practice were attenuated in the real-TMS condition, but not in the sham-TMS or no-TMS conditions. In the second experiment, the authors studied the effects of suprathreshold TMS and subthreshold TMS over M1, lateral premotor cortex, and peripheral arm stimulation using a focal figure-8 coil on motor learning under random practice conditions. The authors found that only suprathreshold TMS on M1 produced significant disruption of retention compared to the other stimulation conditions. Results suggest that a high-threshold neuronal population within M1 is causally important for enhanced retention following random, but not block, practice. Results also support the early intertrial interval as a critical period of M1 activity during practice. Overall, these results suggest neural circuits within M1 contribute to motor learning processing that depends on learners' training experience.

Fourteen healthy volunteers were tested under four conditions: intermittent theta bust stimulation (iTBS), continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), prolonged intermittent theta bust stimulation (ProiTBS) and prolonged continuous theta burst stimulation (ProcTBS). The prolonged paradigms were twice as long as the conventional TBS protocols. Conventional facilitatory iTBS converted into inhibitory when it was applied for twice as long, while the normally inhibitory cTBS became facilitatory when the stimulation duration was doubled.

Sometimes we infer a meaning to an observed action based on integration of the actual percept with memories. Here, we conducted a series of experiments in healthy adults to investigate whether such inferred meanings can also modulate motor cortical outputs in specific ways. We show that brief observation of a neutral stimulus mimicking a hand does not significantly modulate motor cortical excitability (Study 1) although, after prolonged exposure, it can lead to a relatively nonspecific modulation (Study 2). However, when such a neutral stimulus is preceded by exposure to a hand stimulus, the latter appears to serve as a prime, perhaps enabling meaning to the neutral stimulus, which then modulates motor cortical excitability in accordance with mirror neuron-driving properties (Studies 2 and 3). Overall results suggest that a symbolic value ascribed to an otherwise neutral stimulus can modulate motor cortical outputs, revealing the influence of top-down inputs on the mirror neuron system. These findings indicate a novel aspect of the human mirror neuron system: an otherwise neutral stimulus can acquire specific mirror neuron-driving properties in the absence of a direct association between motor practice and perception. This significant malleability in the way that the mirror neuron system can code otherwise meaningless (i.e. arbitrarily associated) stimuli may contribute to coding communicative signals such as language.

Here we investigate whether transmission in the corticospinal tract may explain foot drop (inability to dorsiflex ankle) in persons with spinal cord lesion. The study was performed in 24 persons with incomplete spinal cord lesion (C1 to L1) and 15 healthy controls. Coherence in the 10- to 20-Hz frequency band between paired tibialis anterior muscle (TA) electromyographic recordings obtained in the swing phase of walking, which was taken as a measure of motor unit synchronization. It was significantly correlated with the degree of foot drop, as measured by toe elevation and ankle angle excursion in the first part of swing. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the TA. The amplitude of the MEPs at rest and their latency during contraction were correlated to the degree of foot drop. Spinal cord injured participants who exhibited a large foot drop had little or no MEP at rest in the TA muscle and had little or no coherence in the same muscle during walking. Gait speed was correlated to foot drop, and was the lowest in participants with no MEP at rest. The data confirm that transmission in the corticospinal tract is of importance for lifting the foot during the swing phase of human gait.", "pages": "9216-23"}, {"volume": "104", "title": "Influence of short-interval intracortical inhibition on short-interval intracortical facilitation in human primary motor cortex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15263044", "authors": ["Shirota, Y", "Hamada, M", "Terao, Y", "Matsumoto, H", "Ohminami, S", "Furubayashi, T", "Nakatani-Enomoto, S", "Ugawa, Y", "Hanajima, R"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The effects of theta burst stimulation (TBS) have been extensively investigated in primary motor cortex, where it leads to long-lasting LTP/LTD-like effects on synaptic plasticity.
