The mechanisms involved were evaluated by measuring the thresholds for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and by testing intracortical inhibition and facilitation. With TMS, the threshold for muscle activation on the amputated side was lower than that of the intact side, but with transcranial electrical stimulation there was no difference in motor threshold between the two sides.

In a separate session, TES of equivalent intensity was applied to each hemisphere in 5 of these subjects while they performed the same force-matching protocol. In the resting state, mean threshold intensity for a muscle-evoked potential (MEP) in FDI using TMS was similar for the hemispheres controlling the dominant and nondominant hands. The size of the threshold MEPs in resting FDI after TMS and TES were also similar in each hand. With TMS, contraction-induced facilitation of the MEP in FDI was significantly larger when the nondominant hand was used for index finger abduction. In the pooled data, the nondominant/dominant ratio of MEP areas (normalized to the maximum M wave) ranged from 1. 7 in the weakest contraction (0.5 N) to 1.1 in the strongest (50% MVC). Eight subjects had significant differences between hands in favour of the nondominant hand, whereas in two subjects contraction-induced facilitation of MEPs was larger in the dominant hand. In five subjects for whom detailed motor unit data were available from a previous study, lateral differences in MEP facilitation were positively correlated with differences in FDI motor unit synchronization between hands. With TES, contraction-induced facilitation of the MEP was similar in each hand, suggesting that spinal excitability was equivalent on both sides. For the group of five subjects tested with both stimulation techniques, contraction-induced facilitation of the MEP was significantly larger after TMS than that obtained with TES when the contraction was performed with the nondominant hand, but not when the dominant hand was used to perform the task.

In this study we investigated the effects of cerebellar stimulation on smooth pursuit metrics in man using a focal TMS device. Focal TMS was applied over the posterior cerebellum in an area approximately 7 mm lateral and caudal to the inion, where saccadic eye movements are modulated by TMS, during horizontal smooth pursuit elicited by a step-ramp target with a constant velocity of 15 degrees/s in four normal subjects.

We investigated the effect of TMS on the velocity and acceleration of smooth pursuit. For smooth pursuit directed ipsilateral to the stimulation side (ipsiversive), focal TMS of the posterior cerebellum produced abrupt acceleration of pursuit in both initial acceleration and steady-state tracking phases.

The EMG silence after tendon stimulation appeared at relatively high stimulus intensities (> 50 mA); conditioning cutaneous stimulation left it unchanged, and the inhibition had a short recovery cycle (50 ms). Tendon stimulation still evoked EMG suppression during an ischaemic block of fast-conducting afferents. The motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex during the EMG silence remained almost unchanged, whereas the H reflex was strongly inhibited. Hence we conclude that tendon stimulation activates slow-conducting tendon afferents, possibly group III fibres, connected not through a polysynaptic pathway originating from Ib afferents but through an oligo- or disynaptic inhibitory circuit.

INB alone had no effect on ICI or ICF, whereas INB+rTMSc reduced ICI and increased ICF, and conversely, INB+rTMSi deepened ICI and suppressed ICF. rTMSi and rTMSc alone were ineffective in changing any of these parameters.

The results of this survey of the literature on the subject is that (r)TMS does not represent an alternative to ECT in the therapy of pharmaco-resistant depressions. Due to its slight and only transient antidepressive effect, (r)TMS is also, in our opinion, not suitable as so-called add-on therapy as a complement to antidepressant medication.", "pages": "69-77"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation as an alternative to electroshock therapy in treatment resistant depressions.

CMCT was not significantly altered by any of the exercises under investigation. Peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT) was slightly lengthened by 4% after isometric dumb-bell holding. PMCT and total motor conduction time were decreased after aerobic exercises, probably due to an increase of temperature of the lower extremities.

For this purpose, we examined 50 normal children (age range, 3-11 years) with focal TMS over the left and right hemispheres to target muscles in proximal and distal parts of the upper extremity (first dorsal interosseus, biceps brachii, and brachioradialis).

Considering the role of corticospinal pathways in the control of independent finger movement, we hypothesized that MEP thresholds would better predict speed and dexterity than strength. In 30 right-handers and 30 left-handers, we correlated right and left hand-differences in the threshold for eliciting MEPs with hand-differences in the performance of three manual tasks: finger-tapping speed, pegboard dexterity, and grip strength. Correlations of hand-differences in TMS thresholds with hand-differences in performance indicated that a lower TMS threshold for one hand is strongly associated with greater ability with that hand. The correlations of hand-differences in TMS thresholds with hand-differences in finger-tapping and pegboard dexterity were significantly larger than the correlation of hand-differences in TMS thresholds with hand-differences in grip strength. Our results indicate that hemispheric asymmetries in MEP thresholds may have functional significance related to basic parameters of movement.

These responses occurred with a somewhat longer (on average 6 ms) latency than the typical contralateral response. The duration of the silent period ipsilateral to stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere was longer than in control subjects. Also the contralateral threshold for the unaffected hemisphere was elevated in comparison with the control group. In one patient, who developed mirror movements after stroke, the ipsilateral threshold was exceptionally low and the latency of the ipsilateral response identical to that seen contralaterally. It is concluded that the motor outputs in the unaffected hemisphere are significantly changed after stroke, including the unmasking of ipsilateral corticospinal projections. However, these pathways seem to be of little significance for recovery, as the existence of these responses was not correlated with clinical improvement. The unaffected hemisphere after stroke shows plastic changes in motor output organization after a contralateral lesion.", "pages": "69-77"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "[Usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the objective assessment of therapy for adrenoleukodystrophy].", "issue": "8", "pmid": "2226360", "authors": ["Kano, M", "Obayashi, T", "Ito, K", "Ikeguchi, K", "Niijima, K", "Nishizawa, M"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Rinsho byori.

Other studies have also shown that visual cortical areas can be activated by somatosensory input in blind subjects but not those with sight. The significance of this cross-modal plasticity is unclear, however, as it is not known whether the visual cortex can process somatosensory information in a functionally relevant way. To address this issue, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt the function of different cortical areas in people who were blind from an early age as they identified Braille or embossed Roman letters. Transient stimulation of the occipital (visual) cortex induced errors in both tasks and distorted the tactile perceptions of blind subjects. In contrast, occipital stimulation had no effect on tactile performance in normal-sighted subjects, whereas similar stimulation is known to disrupt their visual performance. We conclude that blindness from an early age can cause the visual cortex to be recruited to a role in somatosensory processing. We propose that this cross-modal plasticity may account in part for the superior tactile perceptual abilities of blind subjects.", "pages": "69-77"}]
