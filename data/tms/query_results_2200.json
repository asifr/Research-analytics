Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right motor cortex was used to obtain motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the left biceps brachii (BB) while participants maintained contraction of the left BB. To examine presumed PN excitability, left BB MEPs were compared with those conditioned by median nerve stimulation (MNS) at the left elbow. Interstimulus intervals between TMS and MNS were set to produce summation at the C3-C4 level of the spinal cord. MNS facilitated BB MEPs elicited at TMS intensities near active motor threshold but inhibited BB MEPs at slightly higher intensities, indicative of putative PN modulation. c-tDCS suppressed the facilitatory and inhibitory effects of MNS. Sham tDCS did not alter either component. There was no effect of c-tDCS and sham tDCS on nonconditioned left BB MEPs or on the ipsilateral silent period of left BB. Right first dorsal interosseous MEPs were suppressed by c-tDCS. These results indicate that M1 c-tDCS can be used to modulate excitability of ipsilateral projections to presumed PNs controlling the proximal arm muscle BB.

We have mainly focused on magnetic resonance applications, probably the most versatile neuroimaging technique available nowadays, and that everyday surprises us with new and exciting applications. But we tackle other alternative and complementary techniques, since a multidisciplinary approach allows a wider perspective over the underlying mechanisms behind tissue repair, plastic reorganization of the brain and compensatory mechanisms that are triggered after stroke. The first of the works of this series is focused on methodological aspects that will help us to understand how it is possible to assess brain function based on different physical and physiological principles.

This perceptual switching occurs spontaneously but can also be influenced through voluntary control. Neuroimaging studies have reported that frontal regions are activated during spontaneous perceptual switches, leading some researchers to suggest that frontal regions causally induce perceptual switches. But the opposite also seems possible: frontal activations may themselves be caused by spontaneous switches. Classically implicated in attentional processes, these same regions are also candidates for the origins of voluntary control over bistable vision. Here too, it remains unknown whether frontal cortex is actually functionally relevant. It is even possible that spontaneous perceptual switches and voluntarily induced switches are mediated by the same top-down mechanisms. To directly address these issues, we here induced \"virtual lesions,\" with transcranial magnetic stimulation, in frontal, parietal, and 2 lower level visual cortices using an established ambiguous structure-from-motion stimulus. We found that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was causally relevant for voluntary control over perceptual switches. In contrast, we failed to find any evidence for an active role of frontal cortex in passive bistable vision.

Difficulty during practice of a serial reaction time task was manipulated by presenting sequences of response locations in a repetitive or an interleaved order.

Correlation analyses indicated that greater BOLD signal in contralateral sensorimotor region and M1 excitability during interleaved practice were interrelated. Furthermore, greater BOLD signal in prefrontal, premotor and parietal areas and greater M1 excitability during interleaved practice correlated with the benefit of interleaved practice on retention.

Only one region, the fO, was significantly more active when subjects selectively attended to a single stimulus so that it determined task performance. The stimuli that guided task performance could belong to three categories--houses, body parts, and faces--associated with three occipitotemporal regions. On each trial, the pattern of functional correlation between the fO and the three occipitotemporal regions became either positive or negative, depending on which stimulus was to be attended and which ignored. Activation of the fO preceded both activity increases and decreases in the occipitotemporal cortex. The causal dependency of the distributed occipitotemporal pattern of activity increases and decreases on the fO was demonstrated by showing that transcranial magnetic stimulation-mediated interference of the fO diminished top-down selective attentional modulation in the occipitotemporal cortex, but it did not alter bottom-up activation of the same areas to the same stimuli when they were presented in isolation. The fO's prominence in cognitive control may stem from a role in regulating the level of activity of representations in posterior brain areas that are relevant or irrelevant, respectively, for response selection.", "pages": "2582-9"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Cortical modulation of the transient visual response at thalamic level: a TMS study.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "5146491", "authors": ["Espinosa, N", "Mari\u00f1o, J", "de Labra, C", "Cudeiro, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "In the human brain, homologous regions of the primary motor cortices (M1s) are connected through transcallosal fibers. Interhemispheric communication between the two M1s plays a major role in the control of unimanual hand movements, and the strength of this connection seems to be dependent on arm activity. For instance, a lesion in the M1 can induce an increase in the excitability of the intact M1 and an abnormal high inhibitory influence onto the damaged M1. This can be attributable to either the disuse of the affected limb or the overuse of the unaffected one. Here, to directly investigate cortical modifications induced by an abnormal asymmetric use of the two limbs, we studied both the excitability of the two M1s and transcallosal interaction between them in healthy subjects whose right hand was immobilized for 10 h. The left \"not-immobilized\" arm was completely free to move in one group of participants (G1) and limited in the other one (G2). We found that the non-use reduced the excitability of the left M1 and decreased the inhibitory influence onto the right hemisphere in the two groups. However, an increase in the excitability of right M1 and a deeper inhibitory interaction onto the left hemisphere were evident only in G1. Thus, modifications in the right M1 were not directly produced by the non-use but would depend on the overuse of the \"not-immobilized\" arm.

Here we exploited the stochastic resonance phenomenon to distinguish these theoretical accounts and determine how TMS affects neuronal processing. Specifically, we showed that online TMS can induce stochastic resonance in the human brain. At low intensity, TMS facilitated the detection of weak motion signals, but with higher TMS intensities and stronger motion signals, we found only impairment in detection. These findings suggest that TMS acts by adding noise to neuronal processing, at least in an online TMS protocol.

In non-injured adults, 30\u00a0min of repetitive common peroneal nerve stimulation (rCPnS) increases CST excitability by 40-50% and the effect persists for at least 30\u00a0min. The present study evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) the changes in CST excitability after 30\u00a0min of rCPnS in people with foot drop due to incomplete SCI. Suprathreshold rCPnS (25\u00a0Hz, alternating 1\u00a0s on 1\u00a0s off stimulation cycle) was given for two 15-min periods, while the subject sat at rest with ankle and knee joints fixed. Before, between, and after the periods of stimulation, the tibialis anterior (TA) motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS were measured at a TMS intensity that originally produced a half-maximum MEP (typically 10-20% above threshold) while the sitting subject provided 25-30% maximum voluntary TA contraction. In 10 subjects with SCI, the peak-to-peak TA MEP increased by 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% after rCPnS and the peak increase (+21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07%) occurred 15\u00a0min after the cessation of rCPnS. The TA H-reflex, measured in separate experiments in 7 subjects, did not increase after rCPnS. The results indicate that rCPnS can increase CST excitability for the TA in people with incomplete SCI, although its effects appear smaller and shorter lasting than those found in non-injured control subjects.

The present study aimed to extend these findings using a novel paradigm in which voluntary actions were either associated with a visual action effect or to no effect. Crucially, this allowed us to explore both sensory attenuation (by comparing ERPs to action-triggered versus externally triggered stimuli) and action effect prediction (by comparing actions that triggered a stimulus with actions that did not). With regard to sensory attenuation, we found that attenuation of cortical responses to visual action effects was manifested in a reduced activation of a frontoparietal network, from 150 ms after stimulus. Differences between actions that produced an effect and those that did not were observed in lateralized motor potentials and may reflect the cortical correlates of the action effect prediction. We also observed a re-activation of lateralized motor activity following onset of the action effect, suggesting a common representation of action effects in visual and motor cortices.

In these studies, however, the analgesic effect of active interventions remained modest compared with the placebo effect. This observation led us to re-evaluate the intrinsic placebo action on pain relief according to the relative timing of active and sham rTMS interventions. In a randomized controlled study including 45 patients, we compared the analgesic effect of sham rTMS that either preceded or followed an active rTMS, which could be itself either successful or unsuccessful. Placebo analgesia differed significantly when the sham rTMS session followed a successful or an unsuccessful active rTMS. Placebo sessions induced significant analgesia when they followed a successful rTMS (mean pain decrease of 11%), whereas they tended to worsen pain when following an unsuccessful rTMS (pain increase of 6%). Only when the sham intervention was applied before any active rTMS were placebo scores unchanged from the baseline. These results probably reflect an unconscious conditioned learning. The timing of placebo relative to active interventions should be taken into account in rTMS studies for pain relief, and possibly in other conditions too. The fact that placebo effects could be enhanced by a previous rTMS with an analgesic effect as low as 10% suggests that a 30% pain decrease threshold in therapeutic trials may be too severe because smaller analgesic effects may have a clinical significance too.

Previous studies suggest that timing is important in determining the behavioural effects of brain stimulation. Regulatory metaplastic mechanisms exist to modulate the effects of a stimulation intervention in a manner dependent on prior cortical excitability, thereby preventing destabilization of existing cortical networks. The importance of such timing dependence has not yet been fully explored for tDCS. Here, we describe the results of a series of behavioural experiments in healthy controls to determine the importance of the relative timing of tDCS for motor performance. Application of tDCS during an explicit sequence-learning task led to modulation of behaviour in a polarity specific manner: relative to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS was associated with faster learning and cathodal tDCS with slower learning. Application of tDCS prior to performance of the sequence-learning task led to slower learning after both anodal and cathodal tDCS. By contrast, regardless of the polarity of stimulation, tDCS had no significant effect on performance of a simple reaction time task. These results are consistent with the idea that anodal tDCS interacts with subsequent motor learning in a metaplastic manner and suggest that anodal stimulation modulates cortical excitability in a manner similar to motor learning.", "pages": "2582-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and threat memory: selective reduction of combat threat memory p300 response after right frontal-lobe stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "20622155", "authors": ["Tillman, GD", "Kimbrell, TA", "Calley, CS", "Kraut, MA", "Freeman, TW", "Hart, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences", "abstract": "We conducted motor- and sensory-evoked potential analyses and investigated their diagnostic value in differentiating between electrical burns without evidence of neurologic injury and those with clinical evidence of myelopathy.", "pages": "2582-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Significant increase in plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone during low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10838597", "authors": ["Trojak, B", "Chauvet-Gelinier, JC", "Verg\u00e8s, B", "Bonin, B"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences", "abstract": "We studied high-voltage electrical burn injury patients with lower extremity weakness and evidence of myelopathy and those without any evidence of neurological complications.

The neuronal network supporting motor timing in FT tasks comprises the lateral cerebellum, the lateral and mesial premotor areas as well as parietal sites. It has been suggested that lateral premotor cortices (PMC) are involved in time representation and sensorimotor transformations needed for synchronization. Most studies have focused on the dorsal aspect of PMC (dPMC) whereas the ventral PMC (vPMC) function has been poorly investigated. Here we used an online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol to probe the role of vPMC in an FT task, as compared to a functionally relevant site (dPMC) and an unrelated one. According to the synchronization-continuation paradigm, subjects had to synchronize their tapping to a periodic continuous visual stimulus, and then continue without the external pacer. Two different visual pacers were used: a tapping finger and a hinged tilting bar. We show that TMS reduced the synchronization error when delivered to the vPMC. This effect was larger when the more abstract hinged tilting bar was used as a pacer instead of the finger. No effects were observed in the continuation phase. We hereby offer the first online-TMS evidence of the involvement of vPMC in visually cued FT tasks.", "pages": "2582-9"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Neural plasticity, potential novel therapies that may enhance neural plasticity in the future, and the role these treatments may have in persons with neurologic injuries.

The first one is a novel semi-automatic technique, called enhanced deflation method (EDM). EDM is a modification of the deflation mode of the FastICA algorithm; with an enhanced independent component search, EDM is an effective tool for removing the large, spiky muscle artifacts. The second technique, called manual method (MaM) makes use of the symmetric mode of FastICA and the artifactual components are visually selected by the user. In order to evaluate the success of the artifact removal methods, four different quality parameters, based on curve comparison and frequency analysis, were studied. The dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and Broca's area (BA) were stimulated with TMS. Both methods removed the very large muscle artifacts recorded after stimulation of these brain areas. However, EDM was more stable, less subjective, and thus also faster to use than MaM. Until now, examining lateral areas of the cortex with TMS-EEG has been restricted because of strong muscle artifacts. The methods described here can remove those muscle artifacts, allowing one to study lateral areas of the human brain, e.g., BA, with TMS-EEG.", "pages": "2582-9"}, {"volume": "22 Suppl 1", "title": "Treatment of shizophrenic patients and rTMS.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16354921", "authors": ["Poulet, E", "Haesebaert, F", "Saoud, M", "Suaud-Chagny, MF", "Brunelin, J"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Psychiatria Danubina", "abstract": "Abnormally enhanced cortical rhythmic activities have been reported in patients with cortical myoclonus.
