Recent studies have shown that procedures presumably leading to local plastic changes in the cerebral cortex can lead to local changes in SWA during subsequent sleep. To further investigate the connection between cortical plasticity and sleep SWA, in this study we used a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which median nerve stimuli were followed at different intervals (25 or 10 ms) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses to the contralateral cortical hand area. As expected, such a protocol led to a sustained increase (long-term potentiation-like) or decrease (long-term depression-like) of cortical excitability as measured by motor evoked potentials. By using a TMS-compatible high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) system, we also found that, in individual subjects, TMS-evoked cortical responses over sensorimotor cortex changed with different interstimulus intervals. Moreover, during subsequent sleep, SWA increased locally in subjects whose TMS-evoked cortical responses had increased after PAS, and decreased in subjects whose cortical responses had decreased. Changes in TMS-evoked cortical EEG response and change in sleep SWA were localized to similar cortical regions and were positively correlated. Together, these results suggest that changes in cortical excitability in opposite directions lead to corresponding changes in local sleep regulation, as reflected by SWA, providing evidence for a tight relationship between cortical plasticity and sleep intensity.", "pages": "7911-8"}, {"volume": "192", "title": "The cortical basis of global motion detection in blindsight.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "1464843", "authors": ["Alexander, I", "Cowey, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of three training paradigms on cortical excitability in healthy subjects. Cortical excitability was evaluated by analysing the input-output relationship between transcranial magnetic stimulation intensity and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the flexor muscles of the fingers. The study was performed with 25 healthy volunteers who underwent 20-min simulated therapy sessions of: (1) functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the finger flexors and extensors, (2) voluntary movement (VOL) with sensory stimulation, and (3) therapeutic FES (TFES) where the electrical stimulation augmented voluntary activation. TFES training produced a significant increase in MEP magnitude throughout the stimulation range, suggesting an increase in cortical excitability.

One likely neural basis for the generation of static phosphenes is the primary visual cortex (V1) although evidence is controversial. A peculiar feature of V1 is that it has sparse callosal connections with the exception of a central portion of visual field representation. In contrast, visually responsive cortical areas in the parietal lobe have widespread callosal connections. Thus, interhemispheric transfer (IT) time of off-centre phosphenes should be slower when generated by V1 than by visual parietal areas. To verify this possibility, in Exp. 1 we measured IT of phosphenes generated by TMS applied to V1 and in Exp. 2 we measured IT of phosphenes obtained by TMS applied to posterior parietal cortex. In both experiments, we obtained static bright circular phosphenes appearing in the contralateral hemifield. We measured IT time behaviorally by comparing unimanual simple reaction time to the onset of a phosphene under crossed or uncrossed hemifield-hand condition (Poffenberger paradigm). In keeping with our prediction, we found a substantially longer IT time for V1 than for parietal phosphenes. Additionally, an IT similar to that obtained with V1 stimulation was found when participants were asked to imagine the phosphenes previously experienced during TMS. In conclusion, the present results suggest that IT of phosphenes either generated by V1 TMS or imagined is subserved by slower callosal channels than those of real visual stimuli or parietal phosphenes.", "pages": "7911-8"}, {"volume": "79", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation for comorbid depression in anorexia].", "issue": "9", "pmid": "10636139", "authors": ["Kamolz, S", "Richter, MM", "Schmidtke, A", "Fallgatter, AJ"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Der Nervenarzt", "abstract": "The motor threshold (MT) is a fundamental parameter for evaluating cortical excitability in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) despite remarkable variation, both within, and between subjects.

Navigated TMS was used to map the primary motor cortex for the representation area of the thenar muscles (abductor pollicis brevis) and to determine the MT. Thirteen healthy subjects participated in the study. To determine the between-subject variation, the MTs of nine subjects were measured with two different stimulators (comparison study). To study the individual variation, the MT measurement was repeated 20 times in four subjects always using the same stimulator (longitudinal study). In the comparison study, the MTs differed significantly between the two stimulators over all subjects (p<0.001), whereas the electric field strengths did not exhibit significant difference between the stimulators. Both, the MTs, and the electric field strengths showed similar variations, which were greater between subjects (comparison study) than within subjects (longitudinal study). In the comparison study, the distance between the locations of the two different coils on the scalp was significantly greater than the distance between the induced electric field maxima in the brain (p<0.001).

The postcentral gyrus (PCG) was included to control for any regionally non-specific effects of rTMS. The only regionally-specific effect was a significant decrease in reaction time when rTMS was applied to SPL.

One hypothesis is that SNS may modulate cortico-anal pathways and drive compensatory changes within the spinal cord or cerebral cortex that beneficially alter sphincter function. Our aim was to assess whether short-term experimental SNS can induce changes in the human cortico-anal pathway. Eight healthy volunteers (mean age 30 years) were studied. Subjects were investigated on three separate occasions and randomized to either active (5 and 15 Hz) or sham rapid-rate lumbosacral magnetic stimulation (rLSMS). Anal sphincter electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from an anal probe following single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, at baseline, immediately, 30 and 60 min following rLSMS at either (i) 5 Hz for 15 min, (ii) 15 Hz for 15 min or (iii) sham stimulation for 15 min. In addition, manometry and anal sphincter sensation was measured in a subset of subjects. Interventions were compared to sham using anova. Fifteen hertz rLSMS increased cortico-anal EMG response amplitude in the 1 h postintervention (F(4, 28) = 3.2, P = 0.027), without a shift in response latency. This effect was not demonstrated with either 5 Hz or sham stimulation. rLSMS had no short-term effect on sensation or physiology. Short-term magnetic stimulation of the sacral nerve roots induces changes in cortico-anal excitability which is frequency specific.

However, experiments exploring these plastic changes have only examined priming-induced effects on a limited number of rTMS protocols, often using designs in which the priming alone had a larger effect than the principle conditioning protocol. The aim of this study was to introduce a new rTMS protocol that gives a broad range of after-effects from suppression to facilitation and then test how each of these is affected by a priming protocol that on its own has no effect on motor cortical excitability, as indexed by motor-evoked potential (MEP). Repeated trains of four monophasic TMS pulses (quadripulse stimulation: QPS) separated by interstimulus intervals of 1.5-1250 ms produced a range of after-effects that were compatible with changes in synaptic plasticity. Thus, QPS at short intervals facilitated MEPs for more than 75 min, whereas QPS at long intervals suppressed MEPs for more than 75 min. Paired-pulse TMS experiments exploring intracortical inhibition and facilitation after QPS revealed effects on excitatory but not inhibitory circuits of the primary motor cortex. Finally, the effect of priming protocols on QPS-induced plasticity was consistent with a BCM-like model of priming that shifts the crossover point at which synaptic plasticity reverses from depression to potentiation.

In this study, we characterized how afferent inputs modulate the excitability of cortical circuits in the leg area of the primary motor cortex by examining how stimulation of the tibial nerve (TN) at the ankle alters motor evoked potentials (MEPs) activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Resting MEPs in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were facilitated in response to heteronymous activation of the TN 45-50 ms earlier, whereas MEPs were inhibited at interstimulus intervals of 32.5-37.5 ms. Similar time-dependent modulation occurred in the soleus (SOL) muscle with stimulation of the homonymous posterior tibial nerve (PTN) at the knee. To determine the site of this afferent-evoked facilitation and inhibition (spinal or cortical), we compared the effects of afferent stimulation to responses evoked at subcortical sites. At interstimulus intervals where MEP facilitation was observed (near 50 ms), spinal H-reflexes and responses evoked from corticospinal tract stimulation at the brainstem were predominantly depressed by the sensory stimulus suggesting that the observed MEP facilitation was cortical in origin. At interstimulus intervals where MEP depression was observed (near 35 ms), brainstem evoked responses were depressed to a similar degree and, in contrast to the hand, this suggests that spinal rather than cortical circuits mediate short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) of leg MEPs. When the MEP was facilitated by afferent inputs, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was reduced and intracortical facilitation (ICF) was increased, but long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) at a 100 ms interval was unchanged. In addition, sensory excitation increased the recruitment of early, middle and late descending corticospinal volleys as evidenced from increases in MEP facilitation at the corresponding I-wave periodicity.

Interestingly, the level of corticospinal excitability modulation was positively correlated with individual scores on the coldheartedness subscale of the PPI, such that individuals with the greatest MEP reduction were the ones scoring highest on the coldheartedness measure.

We reported previously that transsaccadic memory has a capacity for storing the orientations of three to four Gabor patches either within a single fixation (fixation task) or between separate fixations (saccade task). Here, we tested the role of the PPC in transsaccadic memory in eight subjects by simultaneously applying single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right and left PPC, over several control sites, and comparing these to behavioral controls with no TMS. In TMS trials, we randomly delivered pulses at one of three different time intervals around the time of the saccade, or at an equivalent time in the fixation task. Controls confirmed that subjects could normally retain at least three visual features. TMS over the left PPC and a control site had no significant effect on this performance. However, TMS over the right PPC disrupted memory performance in both tasks. This TMS-induced effect was most disruptive in the saccade task, in particular when stimulation coincided more closely with saccade timing. Here, the capacity to compare presaccadic and postsaccadic features was reduced to one object, as expected if the spatial aspect of memory was disrupted. This finding suggests that right PPC plays a role in the spatial processing involved in transsaccadic memory of visual features.

The application of TMS to regions of the cortex adjacent to V5/MT and V3A, as well as to area V1, produced no deficits in speed perception.

Why then does consciousness fade? According to the integrated information theory of consciousness, what is critical for consciousness is not firing rates, sensory input, or synchronization per se, but rather the ability of a system to integrate information. If consciousness is the capacity to integrate information, then the brain should be able to generate consciousness to the extent that it has a large repertoire of available states (information), yet it cannot be decomposed into a collection of causally independent subsystems (integration). A key prediction stemming from this hypothesis is that such ability should be greatly reduced in deep NREM sleep; the dreamless brain either breaks down into causally independent modules, shrinks its repertoire of possible responses, or both. In this article, we report the results of a series of experiments in which we employed a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and high-density electroencephalography (TMS/hd-EEG) to directly test this prediction in humans. Altogether, TMS/hdEEG measurements suggest that the sleeping brain, despite being active and reactive, loses its ability of entering states that are both integrated and differentiated; it either breaks down in causally independent modules, responding to TMS with a short and local activation, or it bursts into an explosive and aspecific response, producing a full-fledged slow wave.", "pages": "7911-8"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Cortical plasticity induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation during wakefulness affects electroencephalogram activity during sleep.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "14568473", "authors": ["De Gennaro, L", "Fratello, F", "Marzano, C", "Moroni, F", "Curcio, G", "Tempesta, D", "Pellicciari, MC", "Pirulli, C", "Ferrara, M", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method to investigate motor pathways and to create a map of the somatotopical organization of the motor cortex: ordinary mapping procedures requires a focal brain stimulation over different spots of the scalp and electromyographic (EMG) recording from a muscle.

Aim of this study was to develop and to validate a method to map cortical representation of an intrinsic hand muscle (abductor digiti minimi, ADM) using a two-dimensional spline interpolation of EMG peak amplitudes obtained with TMS. The interpolated model will result in a graphical colour-scaled representation of the motor cortex for the investigated muscle; fitted model was finally validated by comparing derived parameters with those directly measured to ensure the strength and reliability of the model. Ten healthy volunteers (mean age+/-S.D.: 35.3+/-4.7 years, 4 males and 6 females) were enrolled in the study. Transcranial stimulation was performed by placing a figure-of-eight coil over a predefined grid on the scalp of the subject. EMG responses were recorded from the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM): averaged EMG peak amplitudes obtained at each node were then used to perform spline interpolation and to derive other parameters like center of gravity (CoG). Arithmetical mean of all resting motor threshold at the hotspot was 50.6+/-3.4% of the maximal stimulator output. Average amplitude at the hotspot was 1.72+/-0.80 mV and its coordinates, expressed as median, were x=4.5 cm and y=0.0 cm. Mean CoG was located at x=4.86+/-0.57 cm and y=0.35+/-0.10 cm. Mean interpolated peak coordinates for ADM were xf=4.86+/-0.58 cm and yf=0.36+/-0.12 cm, while mean fitted peak amplitude was 0.87+/-0.47 mV. Results suggest how it is possible to map the primary motor cortex using two-dimensional spline interpolation of peak-to-peak amplitudes obtained by single pulse TMS delivered on several scalp positions, which will result in a smooth, easy to read, colour-scaled map.

We evaluated the effect of stimulus intensity on reliability by using the limits of agreement, and this analysis revealed that the lower stimulus intensities (10 and 20% AMT) exhibited heteroscedasticity, which indicates the amount of random error increases as the silent period increases. The 30% AMT intensity was homoscedastic. We used both visual and mathematical approaches to quantify the SP, and observed that the between-visit coefficient of variation (CV) was less for the visual methods, and that the CV was reduced when the SP onset was earliest in the temporal occurrence of events (i.e. MEP onset to EMG return CV=12%). Inter-rater reliability for the visual analyses were high (r=0.91-0.99).

We also analyzed the self-regulated oral intake of nicotine in these strains and the effect of nicotine on the depression-like symptoms of olfactory bulbectomy. Furthermore, we compared the antidepressant-like effects of nicotine on Wistar rats to those of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has emerged as a therapeutic alternative for depression management. Our results show that Wistar rats develop depression-like symptoms, demonstrated by the forced swim test (FST), 4 weeks after OBX. However, in bulbectomized Long Evans rats these symptoms cannot be assessed due to a higher degree of variability of the swimming behavior of this strain. These results suggest that there are some innate differences in susceptibility to stress between these two rat strains. In Wistar rats, voluntary oral nicotine intake (1.2 mg/(kg day) for 14 days) as well as nicotine administered as a single daily i.p. injection (1.5 mg/(kg day) for 14 days) decrease the depression-like symptoms of OBX. Daily transcranial magnetic stimulation (60 Hz and 0.7 mT for 2h/day for 14 days) also decreases depression-like symptoms but is less effective than nicotine.

Although the suppression of this tendency is integral to tasks of daily living, its exploitation may prove to be critical in the rehabilitation of acquired hemiplegias. Transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation induces changes in cortical excitability that outlast the period of application. We present evidence that changes in the reactivity of the corticospinal pathway induced by DC stimulation of the motor cortex interact systematically with those brought about by contraction of the muscles of the ipsilateral limb. During the application of flexion torques (up to 50% of maximum) applied at the left wrist, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were evoked in the quiescent muscles of the right arm by magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex (M1). The MEPs were obtained prior to and following 10 min of anodal, cathodal or sham DC stimulation of left M1. Cathodal stimulation counteracted increases in the crossed-facilitation of projections to the (right) wrist flexors that otherwise occurred as a result of repeated flexion contractions at the left wrist. In addition, cathodal stimulation markedly decreased the excitability of corticospinal projections to the wrist extensors of the right limb. Thus changes in corticospinal excitability induced by DC stimulation can be shaped (i.e. differentiated by muscle group) by focal contractions of muscles in the limb ipsilateral to the site of stimulation.", "pages": "7911-8"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Demonstration of recovery of a severely damaged corticospinal tract: a diffusion tensor tractography and transcranial magnetic stimulation follow-up study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17014375", "authors": ["Yang, DS", "Kim, DS", "Kim, YH", "Jang, SH"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of computer assisted tomography", "abstract": "Previous studies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation suggest a hemispheric imbalance in patients with major depression.

However, whether the hMNS preferentially responds to end or means of an action remains to be investigated. We, therefore, presented subjects with videos of intentional actions that were shown from two perspectives (factor 1, perspective: first vs. third person) while subjects directed their attention to the means or the end thereof (factor 2, task: means vs. end). End- or means-related changes in BOLD signal and corticospinal excitability (CSE) were assessed using fMRI and TMS, respectively. Judging the means of an action compared with its end differentially activated bilateral ventral premotor (vPMC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPL), that is, the core regions of the hMNS. The reverse contrast revealed left precuneus and bilateral superior frontal, angular, and middle temporal gyrus activity. In accordance, the two tasks, although identically in stimulus properties, modulated CSE differentially. Although recent studies suggest that the hMNS may prefer the presence of a goal or context, our data show that within the same context, it responds preferentially when attention is directed to the action means. Consequently, in addition to inferring action goals, a key function of the hMNS may be to anticipate the trajectories and dynamics of observed actions, which is a prerequisite for any timely interaction.", "pages": "7911-8"}, {"volume": "100", "title": "Noninvasive stimulation of human corticospinal axons innervating leg muscles.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11784772", "authors": ["Martin, PG", "Butler, JE", "Gandevia, SC", "Taylor, JL"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Recently, there has been upsurge of interest in the neural mechanisms of time perception.

Here we asked whether the superior temporal gyrus, an auditory modality specific area, is involved in processing of auditory timing. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over left and right superior temporal gyri while participants performed either a temporal or a frequency discrimination task of single tones. A significant decrease in performance accuracy was observed after stimulation of the right superior temporal gyrus, in addition to an increase in response uncertainty as measured by the Just Noticeable Difference.
