In this paper, we studied long-term neurophysiological effects of rTMS delivered to the motor cortex at 5 Hz with an intensity of 120% of motor threshold. Each stimulus of the train produced muscle-evoked potentials (MEPs) in hand and forearm muscles, which gradually increased in size from the first to the last shock. After the end of the train, the response to a single-test stimulus remained enhanced for 600-900 ms. In contrast, the train had no effect on the size of the MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation, while it suppressed H-reflexes in forearm muscles for 900 ms. We conclude that rTMS of these parameters increases the excitability of the motor cortex and that this effect outlasts the train for almost 1 s. At the spinal level, rTMS may increase presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferent fibers responsible for the H-reflex.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Electrophysiological features of central motor conduction in spinocerebellar atrophy type 1, type 2, and Machado-Joseph disease.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "9771779", "authors": ["Yokota, T", "Sasaki, H", "Iwabuchi, K", "Shiojiri, T", "Yoshino, A", "Otagiri, A", "Inaba, A", "Yuasa, T"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "To characterise electrophysiologically the central motor conduction of spinocerebellar atrophy type 1 (SCA1), type 2 (SCA2), and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD).", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "121 ( Pt 9)", "title": "The role of the human motor cortex in the control of complex and simple finger movement sequences.", "issue": "", "pmid": "8896556", "authors": ["Gerloff, C", "Corwell, B", "Chen, R", "Hallett, M", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) triggered by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to investigate the functions of corticospinal tracts of 10 patients with SCA1, 10 with MJD, and eight with SCA2 in addition to pathological study of the spinal cord in a patient with SCA1.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Peculiarity of soleus motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation of tibial nerve.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "2233862", "authors": ["Wochnik-Dyjas, D", "G\u0142azowski, C", "Niewiadomska, M"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Central motor conduction time (CMCT) was extremely prolonged and the MEP threshold increased in all patients with SCA1, whereas both were normal in patients with SCA2 or MJD.

Eighteen subjects played unimanual finger sequences of different complexity on an electronic piano. For each finger sequence, 16 notes were played to the 2 Hz beat of a metronome. After the first four notes, rTMS was applied to the scalp location overlying the hand motor representation for approximately 2 s. Accuracy and timing errors were analysed. Stimulation over the M1 had a differential effect on sequences of different complexity. Stimulus intensities capable of disrupting the performance of a complex sequence did not affect simple sequences. To disrupt simple sequences, the stimulus strength had to be augmented. This effect was characteristic of the contralateral M1 position (five other scalp locations were also stimulated). It is argued that the differential effect of rTMS on simple and complex sequences is probably due to interference with M1 function. Interference with the lateral premotor cortex (PMC) may play an additional role. The particular relevance of the M1 is supported by results in a patient with PMC stroke. The present findings suggest that the human M1 plays a greater role in the performance of complex than of simple finger movement sequences. One possible explanation could be that the human M1 is not only an executive motor area but can also contribute to movement sequence organization.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Responses of masseter muscles to transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "7847859", "authors": ["Trompetto, C", "Caponnetto, C", "Buccolieri, A", "Marchese, R", "Abbruzzese, G"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "To reveal and discuss the peculiarities of soleus muscle in comparison with electrophysiological features of other leg muscles.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Latency of changes in spinal motoneuron excitability evoked by transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in spinal cord injured individuals.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "8825276", "authors": ["Alexeeva, N", "Broton, JG", "Calancie, B"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Vastus lateralis (L3), tibialis anterior (L4), extensor digitorum brevis (L5) and soleus (S1) muscles were tested at rest.

Recordings of electromyographic (EMG) activity from the tibialis anterior (TA) and corresponding ankle-joint movements were made from both legs. Forward-directed displacements were induced by randomly-timed ramp impulses of constant acceleration upon a moveable platform. For comparison, leg muscle EMG was recorded during isometric foot dorsiflexion during stance while leaning back against a support. The stance perturbations were followed by a compensatory response (CR) in the TA with a mean onset time of 81 ms. During the basic period of muscular activity and the period of plateau EMG activity there was no significant difference of the input-output relation between stance perturbation and the voluntary motor task. However, in the voluntary task compared with the CR, there was significantly greater input-output relation (facilitation) of the EMR in the TA following TMS, which may be related to an increased cortical influence. In contrast to this result of the CR following stance perturbation, a facilitation of the EMR was described for hand muscles under corresponding conditions of automatic compensation for muscle stretch, suggesting a transcortical reflex loop.

In human subjects, stretch applied to ankle dorsiflexors elicited three bursts of reflex activity in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (labelled M1, M2 and M3) at mean onset latencies of 44, 69 and 95 ms, respectively. The possibility that the later of these reflex bursts is mediated by a transcortical pathway was investigated. 2. The stretch evoked a cerebral potential recorded from the somatosensory cortex at a mean onset latency of 47 ms in nine subjects. In the same subjects a compound motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the TA muscle, evoked by magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, had a mean onset latency of 32 ms. The M1 and the M2 reflexes thus had too short a latency to be caused by a transcortical pathway (minimum latency, 79 ms (47 + 32)), whereas the later part of the M2 and all of the M3 reflex had a sufficiently long latency. 3. When the transcranial magnetic stimulation was timed so that the MEP arrived in the TA muscle at the same time as the M1 or M2 reflexes, no extra increase in the potential was observed. However, when the MEP arrived at the same time as the M3 reflex a significant (P < 0.01) extra-facilitation was observed in all twelve subjects investigated. 4. Peaks evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the post-stimulus time histogram of the discharge probability of single TA motor units (n = 28) were strongly facilitated when they occurred at the same time as the M3 response. This was not the case for the first peaks evoked by electrical transcranial stimulation in any of nine units investigated. 5.

Inhibition in extensor muscles was also smaller during tonic wrist extension, or if the induced electrical stimulating current in the brain flowed from posterior to anterior over the motor strip rather than vice versa.

To understand further the mechanisms involved in cortical plasticity, we tested the effects of CNS-active drugs in a plasticity model, in which forearm ischemic nerve block (INB) was combined with low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the deafferented human motor cortex. rTMS was used to upregulate the plastic changes caused by INB. We studied six healthy subjects. In two control sessions without drug application, INB plus rTMS increased the motor-evoked potential (MEP) size and decreased intracortical inhibition (ICI) measured with single- and paired-pulse TMS in the biceps brachii muscle proximal to INB. A single oral dose of the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2 mg) or the voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channel blocker lamotrigine (300 mg) abolished these changes. The NMDA receptor blocker dextromethorphan (150 mg) suppressed the reduction in ICI but not the increase in MEP size. With sleep deprivation, used to eliminate sedation as a major factor of these drug effects, INB plus rTMS induced changes similar to that seen in the control sessions. The findings suggest that (1) the INB plus rTMS-induced increase in MEP size involves rapid removal of GABA-related cortical inhibition and short-term changes in synaptic efficacy dependent on Na+ or Ca2+ channels and that (2) the long-lasting (>60 min) reduction in ICI is related to long-term potentiation-like mechanisms given its duration and the involvement of NMDA receptor activation.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Walking and fatigue in multiple sclerosis: the role of the corticospinal system.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "1522516", "authors": ["Schubert, M", "Wohlfarth, K", "Rollnik, JD", "Dengler, R"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Random number generation is an attention-demanding task that engages working memory and executive processes. Random number generation requires holding information 'on line', suppression of habitual counting, internally driven response generation and monitoring of responses. Evidence from PET studies suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the generation of random responses. We examined the effects of short trains of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left or right DLPFC or medial frontal cortex on random number generation in healthy normal participants. As in previous evidence, in control trials without stimulation participants performed poorly on the random number generation task, showing repetition avoidance and a tendency to count. Brief disruption of processing with TMS over the left DLPFC changed the balance of the individuals' counting bias, increasing the most habitual counting in ones and reducing the lower probability response of counting in twos. This differential effect of TMS over the left DLPFC on the balance of the subject's counting bias was not obtained with TMS over the right DLPFC or the medial frontal cortex. The results suggest that, with disruption of the left DLPFC with TMS, habitual counting in ones that has previously been suppressed is released from inhibition. From these findings a network modulation model of random number generation is proposed, whereby suppression of habitual responses is achieved through the modulatory influence of the left DLPFC over a number-associative network in the superior temporal cortex.

Different techniques have been developed by these centers; each has advantages and disadvantages, and it is clear that no one technique in particular is optimal for all surgical procedures. The corticospinal system can be activated by transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex or by direct stimulation of the spinal cord with electrical or magnetic stimuli delivered singly or as double or multiple pulses. The evoked activity may be recorded directly from the spinal cord using epidural electrode, or as a postsynaptic volley in motor axons (\"neurogenic motor evoked potentials,\" MEP), or as a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from innervated muscles. For scoliosis surgery, we use transcranial electrical stimulation, recording the evoked volley from the spinal cord using epidural electrodes at two spinal levels. By simultaneously stimulating the tibial nerves in the popliteal fossae, descending corticospinal volleys and ascending somatosensory volleys can be recorded in the same sweep. Accordingly, this technique allows monitoring of two different modalities of function at two separate levels of the nervous system, a goal that is most desirable because it helps identify the earliest evidence of dysfunction and at the same time minimizes false-positive reports to the surgeon. Our technique has the advantage of being relatively immune to the depressant effects of anesthesia, and full muscle relaxation is possible--even desirable. More peripheral recordings of neurogenic MEP or CMAP, are sensitive to the choice of anesthetic, and the latter requires incomplete curarization.

Activation of pulmonary C fibres (J receptors) in animals produces inhibition of spinal motoneurones. Intravenous bolus injections of lobeline are believed to activate pulmonary C fibres (J receptors) in human subjects and to produce characteristic sensations and cardiorespiratory responses. This study quantified the respiratory sensations evoked by such injections and then used a range of suprathreshold doses of lobeline and tested for the presence of reflex or descending inhibition of motoneuronal output. 2. Injections of lobeline produced dose-dependent sensations of respiratory discomfort referred to the throat and upper chest beginning within about 10 s and often associated with coughing. As the dose increased the latency for the sensations decreased while their duration and intensity increased. Reflex changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ventilation also occurred. 3. Injections of lobeline at doses sufficient to evoke respiratory discomfort lasting 25-32 s (37-73 microgram kg-1) increased the size of the H reflex in soleus with an onset latency of about 10 s and lasting about 20 s. 4. The size of EMG responses evoked in upper limb muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex increased shortly after injections and remained elevated for about 30-35 s. 5. Injections of lobeline during sustained voluntary contractions of the elbow flexors at submaximal or maximal levels did not impair the ability to produce force. 6. Walking was not disrupted by repeated suprathreshold doses of lobeline. 7.

Varying the S1 intensity between 70 and 130 % resting motor threshold with S2 held constant at 90 % resting motor threshold showed that the threshold for the first MEP peak was <= 70 % resting motor threshold. The second and third MEP peaks appeared only at higher S1 intensities. The latency of all peaks decreased with increasing S1 intensity. 3. Varying the S2 intensity with S1 held constant to produce a MEP of 1 mV on its own showed that the amplitude of all MEP peaks increased with S2 intensity, but that their timing remained unchanged. 4. Paired TMS in the active ADM (S1 clearly suprathreshold, S2 just above threshold; interstimulus interval, 1 ms) produced strong MEP facilitation. The onset of this facilitation occurred later by about 1.5 ms than the onset of the MEP evoked by S2 alone. No MEP facilitation was seen if the magnetic S2 was replaced by anodal or cathodal transcranial electrical stimulation. 5. It is concluded that the MEP facilitation after paired TMS, at least for the first MEP peak, is due to facilitatory interaction between I waves, and takes place in the motor cortex at or upstream from the corticospinal neurone.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "121 ( Pt 5)", "title": "An open-labelled clinical and electrophysiological study of 3,4 diaminopyridine in the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis.", "issue": "", "pmid": "7962487", "authors": ["Sheean, GL", "Murray, NM", "Rothwell, JC", "Miller, DH", "Thompson, AJ"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to provide neurophysiologic evidence of ipsilateral hemispheric activation in patients affected by intracerebral gliomas via the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "79-84"}, {"volume": "121 ( Pt 5)", "title": "Temporary interference in human lateral premotor cortex suggests dominance for the selection of movements.
