In previous studies, motor areas of the brain were activated when people read or listened to action verbs, but it remains unclear whether such activation is functionally relevant for comprehension. In the experiments reported here, we used off-line theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate whether a causal relationship exists between activity in premotor cortex and action-language understanding. Right-handed participants completed a lexical decision task, in which they read verbs describing manual actions typically performed with the dominant hand (e.g., \"to throw,\" \"to write\") and verbs describing nonmanual actions (e.g., \"to earn,\" \"to wander\"). Responses to manual-action verbs (but not to nonmanual-action verbs) were faster after stimulation of the hand area in left premotor cortex than after stimulation of the hand area in right premotor cortex.

Despite this, the neurophysiological long-term consequences of treatment and their relationship to clinical effects are not well understood. Previous studies have shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of abnormal long-term potentiation-like plasticity (paired associative stimulation) and GABAa-ergic inhibition (short-interval intracortical inhibition), which are seen in dystonia, normalize after several months of deep brain stimulation. In the present study, we examine the same measures in a homogenous group of 10 DYT1 gene-positive patients after long-term deep brain stimulation treatment for at least 4.5 years. Recordings were made 'on' deep brain stimulation and after stopping deep brain stimulation for 2 days. The results show that: (i) on average, prior to discontinuing deep brain stimulation, the paired associative stimulation response was almost absent and short-interval intracortical inhibition was reduced compared with normal. This pattern differs from that in both healthy volunteers and from the typical pattern of enhanced plasticity and reduced inhibition seen in deep brain stimulation-na\u00efve dystonia. It is similar to that seen in untreated Parkinson's disease and may relate to thus far unexplained clinical phenomena like parkinsonian symptoms that have sometimes been observed in patients treated with deep brain stimulation. (ii) Overall, there was no change in average physiological or clinical status when deep brain stimulation was turned off for 2 days, suggesting that deep brain stimulation had produced long-term neural reorganization in the motor system. (iii) However, there was considerable variation between patients. Those who had higher levels of plasticity when deep brain stimulation was 'on', had the best retention of clinical benefit when deep brain stimulation was stopped and vice versa. This may indicate that better plasticity is required for longer term retention of normal movement when deep brain stimulation is off. (iv) Patients with the highest plasticity 'on' deep brain stimulation were those who had been receiving stimulation with the least current drain. This suggests that it might be possible to 'shape' deep brain stimulation of an individual patient to maximize beneficial neurophysiological patterns that have an impact on clinical status.

However, a direct link between integrity of frontal oculomotor areas and perceptual stability is missing so far. Here, we show that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right human frontal cortex impairs the integration of visual space across eye movements. We asked 9 healthy subjects to report the direction of transsaccadic stimulus displacements and applied TMS before the actual experiment in a novel offline stimulation protocol, continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS). A systematic perceptual distortion was observed after stimulation over the right frontal cortex that was best explained by an internal underestimation of executed eye movement amplitudes. cTBS apparently disturbed an internal prediction process for contraversive saccades, while the metrics of associated oculomotor actions remained unchanged.

We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1%) in rCBF during stimulation, which returned to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive after-effects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area.

Methods of brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS; paired associative stimulation, PAS) lead to after-effects on cortical excitability that are thought to resemble long-term potentization (LTP)/long-term depression (LTD) in reduced preparations. In a previous study we found that block of D2 receptors abolished plasticity induced by tDCS but had no effect on the facilitatory plasticity induced by PAS. We postulated that the different effect of D2 receptor block on tDCS- and PAS-induced plasticity may be due to the different focality and associativity of the stimulation techniques. However, alternative explanations for this difference could not be ruled out. tDCS also differs from PAS in other aspects, as tDCS induces plasticity by subthreshold neuronal activation, modulating spontaneous activity, whereas PAS induces plasticity via phasic suprathreshold stimulation. The present study in 12 volunteers examined effects of D2 receptor blockade (sulpiride (SULP) 400\u2009mg), on the LTP/LTD-like effects of theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS), which has less restricted effects on cortical synapses than that of PAS, and does not induce associative plasticity, similar to tDCS, but on the other hand induces cortical excitability shifts by suprathreshold (rhythmic) activation of cortical neurons similarly to PAS. Administration of SULP blocked both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of intermittent (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS), respectively.

At each session, five consecutive functional scans were obtained: 1) resting-state without stimulation (Rest-1), 2) a motor scan consisting of self-paced, bilateral finger-thumb opposition task, 3) resting-state with ESB (Stim-1), 4) resting-state without stimulation (Rest-2), and 5) resting-state with ESB, replicating Stim-1 (Stim-2). Data were analyzed using AFNI and MATLAB. For motor task fMRI analysis, a general linear model (GLM) determined the voxels in the right and left M1 that were significantly correlated with the motor task paradigm. The resting-state time series from the voxels in the R-M1 were averaged and the resulting time series used as a regressor in a GLM analysis to identify M1 connectivity maps. Connectivity maps were quantified as R(2) values, and then combined to give overlap maps for each of the experimental conditions. Fourier analysis determined the energy in the normalized signal average time courses extracted from L-M1 and R-M1 for each of the resting-state scans. Both tDCS and tPCS lowered the R(2) values and energy of the averaged time course in the right and left M1 ROI. The effect of the tPCS appeared more pronounced and less variable among subjects.

We first analyzed motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the wrist area of motor cortex before unloading of preloaded wrist flexors, i.e. before the subsequent involuntary wrist motion to another position (natural unloading). Subjects then learned to diminish the post-unloading movement extent without activating antagonist (extensor) muscles before unloading or making intentional movement corrections after unloading (adjusted unloading). Although activity levels of wrist muscles before unloading were similar, MEPs of extensor but not pre-loaded flexor muscles were higher before adjusted unloading. We also applied TMS in combination with a torque pulse that shortened extensor muscles such that the MEP occurred when the motoneuronal excitability was minimized. Although diminished following muscle shortening, MEPs before adjusted unloading were still higher than before natural unloading. Results suggest that the corticospinal system, possibly together with other descending systems participated in the tonic subthreshold facilitation of antagonist motoneurons before adjusted unloading, which appears sufficient in modifying motor commands and motion leading to adjusted unloading.

These standard tests require rapid action cancellation. This appears to be achieved by a suppression mechanism that has \"global\" effects on corticomotor excitability (i.e., affecting task-irrelevant muscles). By contrast, stopping action in everyday life may require selectivity (i.e., targeting a specific response tendency without affecting concurrent action). We hypothesized that while standard stopping engages global suppression, behaviorally selective stopping engages a selective suppression mechanism. Accordingly, we measured corticomotor excitability of the task-irrelevant leg using transcranial magnetic stimulation while subjects stopped the hand. Experiment 1 showed that for standard (i.e., nonselective) stopping, the task-irrelevant leg was suppressed. Experiment 2 showed that for behaviorally selective stopping, there was no mean leg suppression. Experiment 3 directly compared behaviorally nonselective and selective stopping. Leg suppression occurred only in the behaviorally nonselective condition. These results argue that global and selective suppression mechanisms are dissociable. Participants may use a global suppression mechanism when speed is stressed; however, they may recruit a more selective suppression mechanism when selective stopping is behaviorally necessary and preparatory information is available. We predict that different fronto-basal-ganglia pathways underpin these different suppression mechanisms.", "pages": "953-5"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Neuroplastic changes following rehabilitative training correlate with regional electrical field induced with tDCS.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "2803284", "authors": ["Hoegl, T", "Heinrich, H", "Albrecht, B", "Diruf, M", "Moll, GH", "Kratz, O"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "We have recently shown that interference with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of right posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) cortex during the allocation of spatial attention leads to abnormal desynchronization of anticipatory (pretarget) electroencephalographic alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) in occipital-parietal cortex and the detection of subsequently presented visual targets (Capotosto et al. 2009). Since lesion data suggest that lesions of the right frontoparietal cortices produce more severe and long-lasting deficits of visual spatial attention than lesions of the left hemisphere, here, we used the mentioned rTMS-electroencephalographic procedure to test if the control of anticipatory alpha rhythms by IPS is asymmetrically organized in the 2 hemispheres. Results showed that interference with either left or right IPS during covert spatial attention equally disrupted the normally lateralized anticipatory modulation of occipital visual cortex, with stronger alpha desynchronization contralaterally to the attended visual field. In contrast, only interference with right IPS induced a paradoxical pretarget synchronization of alpha rhythms and bilateral deficits of target identification. These results suggest that the control of spatial topography of anticipatory alpha rhythms in occipital-parietal cortex is shared between left and right IPS cortex, but that right IPS uniquely contributes to a bilateral prestimulus activation of occipital visual cortex.", "pages": "953-5"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Interplay of neuronal processes during response inhibition: results from a combined event-related potentials (ERPs)/transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study on methylphenidate.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "1407540", "authors": ["Philiastides, MG", "Auksztulewicz, R", "Heekeren, HR", "Blankenburg, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine if working memory (WM) performance is significantly improved after the delivery of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), compared to an active comparator or sham.", "pages": "953-5"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Causal role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in human perceptual decision making.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "8723642", "authors": ["Cattaneo, Z", "Mattavelli, G", "Papagno, C", "Herbert, A", "Silvanto, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Ten participants undertook three experimental sessions in which they received 10 min of anodal tDCS (active comparator), tRNS or sham tDCS whilst performing the Sternberg WM task.
