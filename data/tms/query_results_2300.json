However, this has not yet been proven in humans. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a decerebrate patient to support the hypothesis. A patient suffering from pontine hemorrhage with the fourth ventricular extension was admitted unconscious and in a decerebrate posture. Five days later, she regained consciousness but remained in a decerebrate posture. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS were measured 1 week after she had regained consciousness, and this provoked muscle responses in her hands and feet bilaterally. During the follow-up, the patient's muscle tone became persistently flaccid, although her strength increased to varying degrees in different body and limb muscles. She remained bedridden for 3 years after the stroke and could neither turn on the bed by herself nor perform skilled movements using her hands. The findings of TMS confirmed the animal studies in that the mechanism of decerebrate rigidity did not come through a damage of the corticospinal pathway. This also implies that a preserved corticospinal tract function cannot guarantee a good motor recovery in a stroke patient.", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "492", "title": "The enhanced cortical activation induced by transcranial direct current stimulation during hand movements.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "21291959", "authors": ["Kwon, YH", "Jang, SH"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate whether tDCS applied on the primary motor cortex (M1) in company with hand movements could enhance cortical activation, using functional MRI (fMRI).

Over time, such increases can strengthen CS pathways damaged by injury or disease and result in enduring improvements in function. There is some evidence that NMES affects CS excitability differently for muscles of the leg and hand, although a direct comparison has not been conducted. Thus, the present experiments were designed to compare the strength and specificity of NMES-induced changes in CS excitability for muscles of the leg and hand. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) For muscles innervated by the stimulated nerve (target muscles), CS excitability will increase more for the hand than for the leg. (2) For muscles not innervated by the stimulated nerve (non-target muscles), CS excitability will increase for muscles of the leg but not muscles of the hand. NMES was delivered over the common peroneal (CP) nerve in the leg or the median nerve at the wrist using a 1-ms pulse width in a 20 s on, 20 s off cycle for 40 min. The intensity was set to evoke an M-wave that was ~15% of the maximal M-wave in the target muscle: tibialis anterior (TA) in the leg and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in the hand. Ten motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the target muscles and from 2 non-target muscles of each limb using transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered over the \"hotspot\" for each muscle before and after the NMES. MEP amplitude increased significantly for TA (by 45 \u00b1 6%) and for APB (56 \u00b1 8%), but the amplitude of these increases was not different. In non-target muscles, MEPs increased significantly for muscles of the leg (42 \u00b1 4%), but not the hand. Although NMES increased CS excitability for target muscles to the same extent in the leg and hand, the differences in the effect on non-target muscles suggest that NMES has a \"global\" effect on CS excitability for the leg and a \"focused\" effect for the hand. These differences may reflect differences in the specificity of afferent projections to the cortex. Global increases in CS excitability for the leg could be advantageous for rehabilitation as NMES applied to one muscle could strengthen CS pathways and enhance function for multiple muscles.", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging: advanced adjuncts in preoperative planning for central region tumors.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "8022220", "authors": ["Forster, MT", "Hattingen, E", "Senft, C", "Gasser, T", "Seifert, V", "Szel\u00e9nyi, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Transient cognitive and behavioral stabilization of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main goal of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy.

On the other hand, neurophysiological methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could offer an alternative, low-cost and risk free tool of assessing response to treatment in AD.

Here we took advantage of repetition priming as a tool to investigate the cognitive representation of actions, and systematically looked whether a concurrent motor or verbal task had a detrimental effect on this representation. In a first experiment participants discriminated images depicting meaningless and meaningful actions, while performing either a concurrent sensory-motor or an articulatory suppression task. Images were classified as depicting a repeated or a new action, relative to the previous image in the trial series. We found a facilitation by repetition priming, that was unaffected by the articulatory task but was completely abolished by the sensory-motor task. In a second experiment, we investigated whether the sensory-motor system is also causally involved in processing action-related verbs. In this experiment actions were presented as written infinitive verbs rather than as images. The facilitation by repetition priming was again unaffected by the concurrent articulatory task, while the sensory-motor concurrent task, although reducing the facilitation, did not abolish it.

This novel paradigm allows analyzing how TMS interacts with the ongoing activity of different neuronal populations following prime processing. Participants were asked to discriminate between angry and happy faces that were preceded by a congruent prime (a word expressing the same emotion), an incongruent prime (a word expressing the opposite emotion) or a neutral prime. In TMS trials, a single pulse was delivered over the mPFC, rSC or Vertex (control site) between prime and target presentation. TMS applied over the mPFC significantly affected the priming effect, by selectively increasing response latencies in congruent trials.

This counterintuitive behavioral result, termed \"spatial suppression,\" is hypothesized to reflect center-surround antagonism-a receptive field property ubiquitous in sensory systems. Prior research proposed that spatial suppression of motion signals is a direct correlate of center-surround antagonism within cortical area MT. Here, we investigated whether human MT/V5 is indeed causally involved in spatial suppression of motion signals. The key assumption is that a disruption of neural mechanisms that play a critical role in spatial suppression could allow these normally suppressed motion signals to reach perceptual awareness. Thus, our hypothesis was that a disruption of MT/V5 should weaken spatial suppression and, consequently, improve motion perception of large, moving patterns. To disrupt MT/V5, we used offline 1 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-a method that temporarily attenuates normal functioning of the targeted cortex. Early visual areas were also targeted as a control site. The results supported our hypotheses and showed that disruption of MT/V5 improved motion discrimination of large, moving stimuli, presumably by weakening surround suppression strength. This effect was specific to MT/V5 stimulation and contralaterally presented stimuli. Evidently, the critical neural constraints limiting motion perception of large, high-contrast stimuli involve MT/V5. Additionally, our findings mimic spatial suppression deficits that are observed in several patient populations and implicate impaired MT/V5 processes as likely neural correlates for the reported perceptual abnormalities in the elderly, patients with schizophrenia and those with a history of depression.", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "492", "title": "1-Hz low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in children with Tourette's syndrome.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16891384", "authors": ["Kwon, HJ", "Lim, WS", "Lim, MH", "Lee, SJ", "Hyun, JK", "Chae, JH", "Paik, KC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Human cortical excitability can be modified by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), but the cellular mechanisms are largely unknown.

Intermittent TBS (iTBS), but not continuous TBS (cTBS), enhanced spontaneous neuronal firing and EEG gamma band power. Sensory evoked cortical inhibition increased only after iTBS, although both TBS protocols increased the first sensory response arising from the resting cortical state. Changes in the cortical expression of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB) indicate that changes in spontaneous and evoked cortical activity following rTMS are in part related to altered activity of inhibitory systems. By reducing PV expression in the fast-spiking interneurons, iTBS primarily affected the inhibitory control of pyramidal cell output activity, while cTBS, by reducing CB expression, more likely affected the dendritic integration of synaptic inputs controlled by other classes of inhibitory interneurons. Calretinin, the third major calcium-binding protein expressed by another class of interneurons was not affected at all.

This ipsilateral excitability was pronounced when the left-hand movements were more complex. We used fMRI to visualize the cortical dynamics during unimanual actions.

Moreover, we recently showed that suppression can be mediated at a spinal level. We characterized LICI more fully by exploring a broad range of contraction strengths and test stimulus intensities. MEPs were evoked in first dorsal interosseous by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex. Single test and paired (conditioning-test interval of 100\u00a0ms) stimuli at intensities of 100-160% resting motor threshold were delivered at rest or during brief contractions of 10, 25, or 100% maximal voluntary force. Inhibition or facilitation was quantified with the standard ratio in which conditioned MEPs were expressed as a percentage of unconditioned MEPs. Inhibition was greatest at weak-moderate contraction strengths and least at rest and during maximal efforts. Both at rest and during maximal efforts, MEPs evoked by strong stimuli were facilitated. In a subset of subjects, cervicomedullary stimulation was used to activate the corticospinal tract to identify possible spinal influences on changes to MEPs. Contraction strength and test stimulus intensity each had different effects on unconditioned and conditioned MEP size, and hence, LICI is highly dependent on both factors. Further, because motoneurons are facilitated during contraction but disfacilitated after a strong conditioning stimulus, the standard ratio of LICI is of questionable validity during voluntary contractions.", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "", "title": "State-dependency effects on TMS: a look at motive phosphene behavior.", "issue": "46", "pmid": "21286740", "authors": ["Najib, U", "Horvath, JC", "Silvanto, J", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "abstract": "While the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for depression remain unclear, recent animal studies have suggested that hippocampal neurogenesis might be required for the effects of antidepressant treatments including antidepressant drugs and electroconvulsive therapy.

In the speech condition subjects were visually cued to prepare a vocal response to a subsequent target, which was compared to a control condition without speech preparation. Auditory and motor cortex responsiveness at variable times between the cue and target were probed with an acoustic stimulus (Experiment 1, tone or consonant-vowels) or motor cortical TMS (Experiment 2). Acoustic probes delivered shortly before targets elicited a fronto-central negative potential in the speech condition. Current density analysis showed that auditory cortical activity was attenuated at the beginning of the slow potential in the speech condition. Sensory potentials in response to probes had shorter latencies (N100) and larger amplitudes (P200) when consonant-vowels matched the sound of cue words.

The present study investigated the role of the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) in shaping saccade curvatures in the context of predictive and non-predictive visual cues. We used an orienting paradigm that incorporated manipulation of target location predictability and delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over rPPC. Participants were presented with either an informative or uninformative cue to upcoming target locations. Our results showed that rPPC TMS generally increased saccade latency and saccade error rates. Intriguingly, rPPC TMS increased curvatures away from the distractor only when the target location was unpredictable and decreased saccadic errors towards the distractor. These effects on curvature and accuracy were not present when the target location was predictable. These results dissociate the strong contingency between saccade latency and saccade curvature and also indicate that rPPC plays an important role in allocating and suppressing attention to distractors when the target demands visual disambiguation.

It is commonly supposed that the STS receives inputs from the OFA, yet it is unknown whether these regions have functionally dissociable, critical roles in sex and trustworthiness judgments. We addressed this issue using event-related, fMRI-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twelve healthy volunteers judged the sex of individually presented faces and, in a separate session, whether those same faces were trustworthy or not. Relative to sham stimulation, RTs were significantly longer for sex judgments when rTMS was delivered over the right OFA but not the right or left STS, and for trustworthiness judgments on male but not female faces when rTMS was delivered over the right STS or left STS but not the right OFA. Nonetheless, an analysis of the RT distributions revealed a possible critical role also for the right OFA in trustworthiness judgments, limited to faces with longer RTs, perhaps reflecting the later, ancillary use of structural cues related to the sex of the face.

Recent studies have shown the effects of TBS last considerably longer in individuals on the autistic spectrum--up to 90 minutes. This extended effect-duration suggests an underlying abnormality in the brain's natural plasticity state in autistic individuals, similar to the hyperexcitability induced by Fragile X Syndrome.

Likewise, negative influences from ipsilesional areas to contralesional M1 were attenuated in the acute stage. In the subacute stage, contralesional M1 exerted a positive influence on ipsilesional M1. Negative influences from ipsilesional areas on contralesional M1 subsequently normalized, but patients with poorer outcome in the chronic stage now showed enhanced negative coupling from contralesional upon ipsilesional M1. These findings show that the reinstatement of effective connectivity in the ipsilesional hemisphere is an important feature of motor recovery after stroke.

During the last decade, numerous studies including several meta-analyses have indicated the efficacy of rTMS in acute treatment of major depressive disorder.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which delivers weak polarizing direct currents to the cortex, is used to modulate cortical excitability. The nature of neuromodulation depends on the stimulation polarity: anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability while cathodal stimulation reduces it. It has been demonstrated that tDCS-induced brain modulations are associated with cognitive changes. In most paradigms tested, excitability-enhancing anodal tDCS proved beneficial to learning and memory processes, attention, and linguistic skills. In this context, tDCS appears to be a promising method to improve cognitive functions in patients with various neurological disorders, including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Exposure to brain polarization may help in specific and selective enhancement of adaptive patterns of activity, suppression of non-adaptive activation patterns, and balancing interhemispheric interactions.", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "[The complex approach to the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients with movement disorders in the early rehabilitation period].", "issue": "4 Pt 2", "pmid": "115906", "authors": ["Khabirov, FA", "Kha\u012dbullin, TI", "Grigor'eva, OV"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

TBS involves applying short trains of stimuli at high frequency repeated at intervals of 200 milliseconds. Because repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is known to carry a risk of seizures, safety guidelines have been established. TBS has the theoretical potential of conferring an even higher risk of seizure than other repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols because it delivers high-frequency bursts. In light of the recent report of a seizure induced by TBS, the safety of this new protocol deserves consideration. We performed an English language literature search and reviewed all studies published from May 2004 to December 2009 in which TBS was applied. The adverse events were documented, and crude risk was calculated. The majority of adverse events attributed to TBS were mild and occurred in 5% of subjects. Based on this review, TBS seems to be a safe and efficacious technique. However, given its novelty, it should be applied with caution. Additionally, this review highlights the need for rigorous documentation of adverse events associated with TBS and intensity dosing studies to assess the seizure risk associated with various stimulation parameters (e.g., frequency, intensity, and location).", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Brain stimulation in posttraumatic stress disorder.", "issue": "", "pmid": "7263958", "authors": ["Novakovic, V", "Sher, L", "Lapidus, KA", "Mindes, J", "A Golier, J", "Yehuda, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "abstract": "Although a growing body of evidence suggests that noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation have the capacity to enhance neural function in both brain-injured and neurally intact individuals, the implications of their potential use for cosmetic self-enhancement have not been fully explored.

We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and two semantic decision tasks to assess the role of these regions in healthy participants. Participants made semantic decisions about the function (what for) or manipulation (how) of tools used in daily life.

Here we examined the possibility that corticospinal and spinal excitability vary in a contraction-specific manner in the relaxed right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) when humans perform unilateral lengthening and shortening contractions of the left wrist flexors at the same absolute force. Corticospinal excitability in the relaxed right FCR increased more during lengthening than shortening at 80% and 100% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Short-interval intracortical inhibition diminished during shortening contractions, and it became nearly abolished during lengthening. Intracortical facilitation lessened during shortening but increased during lengthening. Interhemispheric inhibition to the 'non-active' motor cortex diminished during shortening, and became nearly abolished during lengthening at 90% MVC. The amplitude of the Hoffman reflex in the relaxed right FCR decreased during and remained depressed for 20 s after lengthening and shortening of the left wrist flexors. We discuss the possibility that instead of the increased afferent input, differences in the descending motor command and activation of brain areas that link function of the motor cortices during muscle lengthening vs. shortening may cause the contraction-specific modulation of ipsilateral motor cortical output. In conclusion, ipsilateral motor cortex responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation are contraction-specific; unilateral lengthening and shortening contractions reduced contralateral spinal excitability, but uniquely modulated ipsilateral corticospinal excitability and the networks involved in intracortical and interhemispheric connections, which may have clinical implications.", "pages": "37-9"}, {"volume": "", "title": "The NeuroStar TMS device: conducting the FDA approved protocol for treatment of depression.", "issue": "45", "pmid": "3722441", "authors": ["Horvath, JC", "Mathews, J", "Demitrack, MA", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "abstract": "Sports concussions affect thousands of individuals every year and are a major public health concern. Still, little is known about the long-term and cumulative effects of concussions on brain neurophysiology. The principal objective of this study was to investigate the long-lasting effects of multiple sports concussions on sensorimotor integration and somatosensory processing in a sample of 12 concussed athletes and 14 non-concussed athletes of similar age (mean, 23 years) and education (mean, 16 years). Right median nerve stimulation was paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left primary motor cortex to investigate sensorimotor integration with short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long latency afferent inhibition (LAI) at five interstimulus intervals (18, 20, 22, 100, 200 msec). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded from the left centro-parietal region. We also investigated primary motor cortex inhibitory mechanisms with three TMS protocols: cortical silent period, long interval intracortical inhibition, and short interval intracortical inhibition. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. No differences were observed between groups for SAI, LAI, and SEP. However, cortical silent period duration was prolonged and long interval intracortical inhibition was enhanced in the concussed group. These findings suggest that multiple sports concussions lead to specific, long-term neurophysiological dysfunctions of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms in primary motor cortex while somatosensory processing and sensorimotor integration are spared.
