In this study, we investigated how two modem antidepressant therapies, chronic treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and administration of an antidepressant belonging to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), paroxetine, affect the proliferative response of thymocytes and splenocytes stimulated in vitro with various mitogens. Paroxetine (10 mg/kg) and TMS (B = 1.2 T, f = 30 Hz, t = 330 s) were applied once daily for 12 consecutive days, while, if given jointly paroxetine was injected 30 min before TMS. The mitogens used were: concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). While either treatment applied alone had no effect on proliferative response, the joint application of paroxetine and TMS significantly depressed it. The literature data suggest that pulsed magnetic field may directly inhibit mitogen-activated lymphocyte proliferation, which is also inhibited by the presence of high level of serotonin. The present results suggest that both effects are additive, and because of that application of both treatments, whose effects alone are insufficient to prompt the reaction, possibly because adaptive changes during chronic treatment, results in a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Increased cortical excitability with longer duration of Parkinson's disease as evaluated by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "12865507", "authors": ["Bhatia, M", "Johri, S", "Behari, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurology India", "abstract": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate the cortical excitability and central motor pathways in Parkinson's disease (PD) and correlate with severity and duration of disease. 19 cases of PD and 13 controls were enrolled.

This abnormality is possibly caused by a reduced cortical preactivation level due to hypofunctioning subcortico-cortical aminergic pathways. Although studies of cortical excitability by transcranial magnetic stimulation have yielded conflicting results, results obtained using habituation of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials to explore cortical excitability changes induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation strongly favour the hypothesis that migraine is characterized by a decreased level of preactivation excitability.

To this end, we investigated the relationship between various stimulus intensities applied via transcranial magnetic stimulation and the size of motor-evoked potentials in 14 healthy subjects during voluntary plantarflexion and dorsiflexion (active lengthening) with a similar background activity (BGA) level. The shape of this relationship was sigmoidal and was characterized by a plateau value, maximum slope and threshold. The plateau value was clearly lower during LEN contractions than during SHO contractions. Likewise, the maximum slope was lower during LEN contractions. However, the threshold did not differ significantly between the two tasks. Since the plateau value and the maximum slope clearly differed between LEN and SHO contractions despite the similarity of their BGA levels, the central nervous system appears to have a different activation strategy for each of these tasks. Namely, the relative balance between excitatory and inhibitory components of the corticospinal volleys, as well as the subliminal fringe of the corticospinal pathway, were reduced during LEN contractions compared with SHO contractions. These strategies may help to avoid reflexive contractions brought about by higher discharge of muscle spindles and enable fine motor actions in voluntary lengthening contractions.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess cortical plasticity: a critical perspective for stroke rehabilitation.", "issue": "41 Suppl", "pmid": "11336912", "authors": ["Butler, AJ", "Wolf, SL"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of rehabilitation medicine : official journal of the UEMS European Board of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine", "abstract": "Previous research suggests that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits in a range of parameters of motor cortical and cognitive inhibition.

Eighteen patients with schizophrenia (nine medication-free) were compared with eight control subjects. We assessed resting motor threshold (RMT) levels, LICI and I-wave facilitation. RMT levels did not differ between the three groups. There was a significant overall difference in I-wave facilitation levels. Both patient groups as compared with the control group showed increased facilitation. There were no differences between the groups in the measure of LICI.

The aim of this study was to explore how rTMS changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. Using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left M1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. In particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 Hz rTMS. Analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of M1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. Conversely, after rTMS our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left M1 and anterior motor areas. These results are important for three reasons. First, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). Second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rTMS, similar to that seen in stroke patients. Third, changes in motor activations at the site of rTMS suggest an rTMS-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. This remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Induction of mania by rTMS: report of two cases.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11801432", "authors": ["Sakkas, P", "Mihalopoulou, P", "Mourtzouhou, P", "Psarros, C", "Masdrakis, V", "Politis, A", "Christodoulou, GN"], "year": "2003", "journal": "European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive tool that directly stimulates cortical neurons by inducing magnetic and secondary electric fields.

Eleven healthy subjects participated. Stimulus-response curves were generated from the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded in the tongue musculature and, from the first dorsal interosseos (FDI) muscle as a control, at three time periods: at baseline, immediately after the 1-week training period, and at 2-weeks follow-up. In addition, the corticomotor representations of the tongue and FDI muscles were mapped on a 1 x 1 cm scalp grid. The tongue-training task required each subject to protrude the tongue onto a force transducer placed in front of the subject, and consisted of a relax-protrude-hold-relax cycle lasting 12.5 s with 1 N as the target at the hold phase. The subjects repeated this task for 60 min every day for 1 week. All subjects reported moderate levels of fatigue in the tongue during the first training day; however, these subjective reports decreased during the week (ANOVA P<0.001), and the subjects showed a progressive increase in their ability to perform the task successfully ( P<0.001). The threshold for evoking MEPs by TMS in the tongue musculature was significantly decreased after the last training day compared with baseline and the 2-weeks follow-up ( P<0.001). The amplitude of the MEPs in the tongue musculature was significantly increased at higher intensities of TMS after the last training day but returned to baseline values at the 2-weeks follow-up (P = 0.005). No significant effect of the training on MEPs in the FDI was observed (P = 0.493).

Inhibition at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-5 ms is ascribed to a GABAergic inhibitory system in the motor cortex. However, Fisher et al. have proposed that different mechanisms are operating at an ISI of 1 ms and 2.5 ms. In order to confirm their concept and clarify whether inhibition at all these intervals is produced by a single mechanism, we compared effects of paired-pulse stimulation at ISIs of 1 ms, 2 ms, and 3-5 ms. We evaluated how intracortical inhibition affected the I3-wave, I1-wave, magnetic D-wave, and anodal D-wave components of electromyographic (EMG) responses using previously reported methods. The data suggest that three separate effects occur within these ISIs. At ISIs of 3-5 ms, inhibition was evoked only in responses to I3-waves, whereas no inhibition was elicited in responses to I1-waves or magnetic D-waves. In contrast, at an ISI of 1 ms, responses to I3-waves and I1-waves were moderately suppressed. Moreover, even magnetic D-waves were slightly suppressed, whereas anodal D-waves were unaffected. At an ISI of 2 ms, none of the descending volleys were inhibited. We propose that we should use ISIs of 3-5 ms for estimating function of the GABAergic inhibitory system of the motor cortex by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Our results support the idea of Fisher et al. that the mechanism responsible for the inhibition at an ISI of 1 ms is not the same as that responsible for suppression at ISIs of 3-5 ms (GABAergic inhibitory circuits in the motor cortex). At an ISI of 2 ms, we suggest that the inhibitory influence evoked by the first stimulus (S1) should collide with or be occluded by the second stimulus (S2), which leads to the lack of inhibition when the subjects make a voluntary contraction of the target muscle.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "550", "title": "Differential modulation of intracortical inhibition in human motor cortex during selective activation of an intrinsic hand muscle.", "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "1773767", "authors": ["Zoghi, M", "Pearce, SL", "Nordstrom, MA"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Although acupuncture is increasingly utilized for medical therapy, its mechanism of action remains uncertain.

We used the recently developed triple stimulation technique (TST) to study corticospinal conduction after fatiguing exercise in healthy subjects. This method employs a collision technique to estimate the proportion of motor units activated by a transcranial magnetic stimulus. Following a sustained contraction of the abductor digiti minimi muscle at 50 % maximal force maintained to exhaustion there was an immediate reduction of the TST response from > 95 % to about 60 %. This effect recovered to control levels within 1 min and implies that a decreased number of spinal MNs were excited. Additional TST experiments after maximal and submaximal efforts showed that the decrease in size of the TST response was related to duration and strength of exercise. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and responses to peripheral nerve stimulation were recorded following the same fatigue protocol. The size of both the MEPs and the peripheral responses increased after the contraction and were in direct contrast to the decrease in size of the TST response. This points to increased probability of repetitive spinal MN activation during fatigue even if some MNs in the pool failed to discharge. Silent period duration following cortical stimulation lengthened by an average of 55 ms after the contraction and recovered within a time course similar to that of the TST response depression. Overall, the results suggest that the outflow from the motor cortex could become insufficient to drive all spinal MNs to discharge when the muscle is fatigued and that complex interactions between failure of activation and compensatory mechanisms to maintain motor unit activation occur during sustained voluntary activity. When inability to maintain force occurs during submaximal effort, failure of activation of motor units is predominant.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Neurocognitive effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in severe major depression.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "3079553", "authors": ["Martis, B", "Alam, D", "Dowd, SM", "Hill, SK", "Sharma, RP", "Rosen, C", "Pliskin, N", "Martin, E", "Carson, V", "Janicak, PG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Twelve patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD), none of whom had received any previous L-DOPA treatment, but using other antiparkinsonian drugs, were studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

By utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a metacontrast masking paradigm, we addressed whether feedback processes in early visual cortex play a role in visual awareness. We show that TMS of visual cortex, when timed to produce visual suppression of an annulus serving as a metacontrast mask, induces recovery of an otherwise imperceptible disk. In addition to producing disk recovery, TMS suppression of an annulus was greater when a disk preceded it than when an annulus was presented alone. This latter result suggests that there are effects of the disk on the perceptibility of the subsequent mask that are additive and are revealed with TMS of the visual cortex.

We hypothesised that the suppression of ICI with selective activation of a muscle would be restricted to corticospinal neurons controlling the muscle targeted for activation. Surface EMG was recorded from abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles of the left hand. Subjects were tested at rest and during weak selective activation of APB or ADM, while they attempted to keep the other muscles relaxed using visual feedback. Paired-pulse TMS was applied with a circular coil oriented to produce antero-posterior (AP) current flow in the right motor cortex (to preferentially evoke I3 waves in corticospinal neurons) and with postero-anterior (PA) currents (to preferentially evoke I1 waves). Paired-pulse TMS was less effective in suppressing the muscle evoked potential (MEP) when the muscle was targeted for selective activation, with both AP and PA stimulation. The mechanism for this includes effects on late I waves, as it was evident with a weak AP test TMS pulse that elicited negligible I1 waves in corticospinal neurons. ICI circuits activated by TMS, which exert their effects on late I waves but do not affect I1 waves, are strongly implicated in this modulation. With AP stimulation, paired-pulse inhibition was not significantly altered for corticospinal neurons controlling other muscles of the same hand which were required to be inactive during the selective activation task. This differential modulation was not seen with PA stimulation, which preferentially activates I1 waves and evokes a MEP that is less influenced by ICI. The observations with AP stimulation suggest that selective activation of a hand muscle is accompanied by a selective suppression of ICI effects on the corticospinal neurons controlling that muscle. The pattern of differential modulation of ICI effectiveness with voluntary activation suggests that the ICI circuits assist the corticospinal system in producing fractionated activity of intrinsic hand muscles.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "An event-related optical topography study of cortical activation induced by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9508850", "authors": ["Noguchi, Y", "Watanabe, E", "Sakai, KL"], "year": "2003", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Sensory abnormalities have been reported in Parkinson's disease and may contribute to the motor deficits. Peripheral sensory stimulation inhibits the motor cortex, and the effects depend on the interstimulus interval (ISI) between the sensory stimulus and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the motor cortex. Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) occurs at an ISI of approximately 20 ms, and long latency afferent inhibition (LAI) at an ISI of approximately 200 ms. We studied SAI and LAI in 10 Parkinson's disease patients with the aim of assessing whether sensorimotor processing is altered in Parkinson's disease. Patients were studied on and off medication, and the findings were compared with 10 age-matched controls. Median nerve and middle finger stimulation were delivered 20-600 ms before TMS to the contralateral motor cortex. The motor evoked potentials were recorded from the relaxed first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. SAI was normal in Parkinson's disease patients off dopaminergic medications, but it was reduced on the more affected side in Parkinson's disease patients on medication. LAI was reduced in Parkinson's disease patients compared with controls independent of their medication status. LAI reduced long interval intracortical inhibition in normal subjects but not in Parkinson's disease patients. The different results for SAI and LAI indicate that it is likely that separate mechanisms mediate these two forms of afferent inhibition. SAI probably represents the direct interaction of a sensory signal with the motor cortex. This pathway is unaffected by Parkinson's disease but is altered by dopaminergic medication in Parkinson's disease patients and may contribute to the side effects of dopaminergic drugs. LAI probably involves other pathways such as the basal ganglia or cortical association areas.

We have extensively reviewed evoked potential and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies performed in migraineurs in order to identify their pathophysiologic significance. Publications available to us were completed by a Medline search. Retrieved and personal data were compared with respect to methodology and interpreted according to present knowledge on cortical information processing. Results are in part contradictory which appears to be method-, patient- and disease- related. Nonetheless, both evoked potential and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies demonstrate that the cerebral cortex, and possibly subcortical structures, are dysfunctioning interictally in both migraine with and without aura. These electrophysiologic abnormalities tend to normalise just before and during an attack and some of them seem to have a clear familial and predisposing character. Besides the studies of magnetophosphenes which have yielded contrasting results, chiefly because the method is not sufficiently reliable, most recent electrophysiologic investigations of cortical activities in migraine favour deficient habituation and decreased preactivation cortical excitability as the predominant interictal dysfunctions. We propose that the former is a consequence of the latter and that it could favour both interictal cognitive disturbances as well as a cerebral metabolic disequilibrium that may play a role in migraine pathogenesis. To summarize, electrophysiologic studies demonstrate in migraine between attacks a cortical, and possibly subcortical, dysfunction of which the hallmark is deficient habituation.", "pages": "633-9"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Repetitive TMS temporarily alters brain diffusion.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "11726806", "authors": ["Mottaghy, FM", "Gangitano, M", "Horkan, C", "Chen, Y", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is a widely used method to study cortical inhibition, and abnormalities have been found in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggested that SICI involves two phases and the first phase may be explained by axonal refractoriness. Our objectives are to further investigate the mechanisms of the two phases of SICI. SICI was studied in 11 normal volunteers by a paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm applied to the left motor cortex with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (80% resting motor threshold for rest condition and 95% active motor threshold for active condition) followed by a suprathreshold test stimulus at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-4.5 ms in steps of 0.5 ms. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Three different test stimulus intensities adjusted to produce 0.2, 1 and 4 mV MEPs at rest were studied with the target muscle relaxed and during 20% maximum contraction. Maximum inhibition was observed at ISIs of 1 ms and 2.5 ms for the rest condition and the difference among ISIs was reduced with voluntary contraction. SICI increased with larger test MEP amplitude and decreased with voluntary contraction. At test MEP of 0.2 mV, some subjects showed facilitation and this is likely related to short-interval intracortical facilitation. For rest SICI, the correlation between adjacent ISIs was much higher from 3 to 4.5 ms than from 1 to 2.5 ms or between 1 and 2.5 ms. There was no correlation between SICI at different test MEP amplitudes. We conclude that maximum SICI at ISIs of 1 and 2.5 ms are mediated by different mechanisms. SICI at 1 ms cannot be fully explained by axonal refractoriness and synaptic inhibition may be involved.
