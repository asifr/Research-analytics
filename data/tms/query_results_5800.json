It has been shown recently that stimulation of the smooth-pursuit area of the FEF [frontal pursuit area (FPA)] in monkey increases the pursuit response to unexpected changes in target motion during pursuit. In the current study, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the FPA and SEF in humans during sinusoidal pursuit to assess its effects on the pursuit response to predictable, rather than unexpected, changes in target motion. For the FPA, we found that TMS applied immediately before the target reversed direction increased eye velocity in the new direction, whereas TMS applied in mid-cycle, immediately before the target began to slow, decreased eye velocity. For the SEF, TMS applied at target reversal increased eye velocity in the new direction but had no effect on eye velocity when applied at mid-cycle. TMS of the control region (leg region of the somatosensory cortex) did not affect eye velocity at either point. Previous stimulation studies of FPA during pursuit have suggested that this region is involved in controlling the gain of the transformation of visual signals into pursuit motor commands. The current results suggest that the gain of the transformation of predictive signals into motor commands is also controlled by the FPA. The effect of stimulation of the SEF is distinct from that of the FPA and suggests that its role in sinusoidal pursuit is primarily at the target direction reversal.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Visual area V5/MT remembers \"what\" but not \"where\".", "issue": "12", "pmid": "16407478", "authors": ["Campana, G", "Cowey, A", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Priming for motion direction has been shown to depend upon the functional integrity of extrastriate area V5/MT. Its retinotopic organization and the interactions recently found between motion adaptation and misperceived localization may suggest, for this area, a role for priming of spatial position in addition to the established priming of motion direction. Disruption of V5/MT with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during the intertrial interval had the effect of abolishing priming of motion direction but no effect in priming of spatial position. These effects cannot be explained in terms of perception or task demands but only in terms of the effects of information irrelevant to the correct performance of the task stored over the intertrial interval.

In this study, we examined if such recovery is mediated, in part, by increases in residual corticospinal drive to muscles of the leg during walking. To do this, we measured the coherence of electromyogram (EMG) activity between two antagonist muscles (intermuscular coherence), specifically at frequencies between 24 and 40 Hz, which is thought to indicate common drive to two muscles from corticospinal inputs. In 12 subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury, intermuscular coherence was measured between hamstrings and vastus lateralis EMG that was activated during walking on a motorized treadmill. Before training, appreciable coherence in the 24-40 Hz frequency band was only present in subjects with moderate volitional motor strength in their leg muscles (n = 8 subjects) compared with subjects with little or no leg muscle strength (n = 4 subjects), reconfirming that 24-40 Hz frequency coherence is likely mediated by common supraspinal inputs. After training, increases in 24-40 Hz coherence only occurred in the eight subjects with moderate leg muscle strength who also exhibited improvements in locomotor recovery as assessed by the 21 point WISCI II scale (termed responders). In contrast, development of intermuscular coherence in the 24-40 Hz frequency band did not occur in the four subjects with absent or weak muscle strength. These subjects also did not improve in their locomotor ability as reflected in unchanging WISCI II scores (termed nonresponders). Lower-frequency coherence (5-18 Hz), which is thought to contain common drive from spinal inputs, did not change in either group. In a subset of subjects that were previously assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after training (n = 5 responders and 3 nonresponders), there was a significant and positive relationship between increases in 24-40 Hz coherence and increases in evoked muscle responses to TMS of the primary motor cortex. Taken together, increases in higher-frequency EMG coherence in subjects with residual voluntary muscle strength and its parallel relation to changes in TMS-evoked responses provides further evidence that improvements in locomotor function from treadmill training are mediated, in part, by increases in corticospinal drive to muscles of the leg during walking.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "154", "title": "Responses of the diaphragm to transcranial magnetic stimulation during wake and sleep in humans.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16406377", "authors": ["Mehiri, S", "Straus, C", "Arnulf, I", "Attali, V", "Zelter, M", "Derenne, JP", "Similowski, T"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Respiratory physiology & neurobiology", "abstract": "The human ventilation depends on bulbospinal and corticospinal commands.

The intriguing symptom is a spontaneous orientation bias towards the right leading to neglect of objects or persons on the left. Interestingly, we observe similar symptoms namely a spontaneous bias of eyes and head along the horizontal dimension of space in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction. Further similarities concern anatomical findings. Both spatial neglect and vestibular processing at cortical level show dominance in the right hemisphere and involve common brain areas. Lesion studies in human and monkey, electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulation, as well as functional imaging results have revealed the superior temporal cortex, insula and the temporo-parietal junction to be substantial parts of the multisensory (vestibular) system as well as to be affected in spatial neglect. We argue that these structures are not strictly 'vestibular' but rather have a multimodal character representing a significant site for the neural transformation of converging vestibular, auditory, neck proprioceptive and visual input into higher order spatial representations. Neurons of these regions provide us with redundant information about the position and motion of our body in space. They seem to play an essential role in adjusting body position relative to external space.

This progressive lengthening probably reflects temporal summation of the inhibitory interneurons in the stimulated primary motor cortex (M1). In this study, we tested whether high-frequency rTMS also modulates the ipsilateral silent period (ISP). In nine normal subjects, suprathreshold 10-pulse rTMS trains were delivered to the right M1 at frequencies of 3, 5, and 10 Hz during maximal isometric contraction of both first dorsal interosseous muscles. At 10 Hz, the second pulse of the train increased the area of the ISP; the other stimuli did not increase it further. During rTMS at 3 and 5 Hz, the ISP remained significantly unchanged. Control experiments showed that 10-Hz rTMS delivered at subthreshold intensity also increased the ISP. rTMS over the hand motor area did not facilitate ISPs in the biceps muscles. Finally, rTMS-induced ISP facilitation did not outlast the 10-Hz rTMS train. These findings suggest that rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz potentiates the interhemispheric inhibitory mechanisms responsible for the ISP, partly through temporal summation. The distinct changes in the ISP and CSP suggest that rTMS facilitates intrahemispheric and interhemispheric inhibitory phenomena through separate neural mechanisms. The ISP facilitation induced by high-frequency rTMS is a novel, promising tool to investigate pathophysiological abnormal interhemispheric inhibitory transfer in various neurological diseases.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "170", "title": "Afferent stimulation facilitates performance on a novel motor task.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10080512", "authors": ["McDonnell, MN", "Ridding, MC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Focal activation during recovered hand movements was assessed with EEG spectral analysis and H2(15)O-PET with EMG monitoring, cortico-cortical connectivity with EEG coherence analysis (cortico-cortical coherence) and corticospinal connectivity with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). As seen from comparisons with age-matched controls, our patients showed enhanced recruitment of the lateral premotor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere [Brodmann area (BA) 6], lateral premotor and to a lesser extent primary sensorimotor and parietal cortex of the contralesional hemisphere (CON-H; BA 4 and superior parietal lobule) and left cerebellum (patients versus controls, Z > 3.09). EEG coherence analysis showed that after stroke cortico-cortical connections were reduced in the stroke hemisphere but relatively increased in the CON-H (ANOVA, contrast analysis, P < 0.05), suggesting a shift of functional connectivity towards the CON-H. Nevertheless, fast conducting corticospinal transmission originated exclusively from the lesioned hemisphere. No direct ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) could be elicited with TMS over the contralesional primary motor cortex (iM1) in stroke patients. We conclude that (i) effective recovery is based on enhanced utilization of ipsi- and contralesional resources, (ii) basic corticospinal commands arise from the lesioned hemisphere without recruitment of ('latent') uncrossed corticospinal tract fibres and (iii) increased contralesional activity probably facilitates control of recovered motor function by operating at a higher-order processing level, similar to but not identical with the extended network concerned with complex movements in healthy subjects.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "170", "title": "Short-interval cortical inhibition and corticomotor excitability with fatiguing hand exercise: a central adaptation to fatigue?", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10203343", "authors": ["Benwell, NM", "Sacco, P", "Hammond, GR", "Byrnes, ML", "Mastaglia, FL", "Thickbroom, GW"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It is claimed that these processes can be reversed by two weeks of constraint of the unaffected limb combined with intensive practice in use of the paretic hand, and numerous small-scale studies have suggested that CIMT can lead to large improvements in function more than a year after stroke. However, the theory of learned non-use is open to question and there is uncertainty about the nature of the improvements induced by CIMT. The greatest effect seems to be increased spontaneous use of the hand, either through reduction of learned non-use or by overcoming the sense of effort during movement. There is also evidence of some improvement on dexterity tests but no studies have analysed in detail whether this reflects reduction of basic motor impairment or learning of compensatory movement strategies. The current weight of evidence is in favour of compensatory learning. Cortical changes detected by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or functional imaging may reflect this compensatory motor skill learning rather than restoration of representations lost due to the infarct or non-use of the limb.

Three groups of nine normal subjects participated in these studies. All subjects were trained on the grooved pegboard test (GPT). Training consisted of three blocks, each of five trials, of placing pegs as quickly as possible. The time to complete each block was recorded. One group of subjects had a 1-h period of associative stimulation prior to training on the GPT. A second group received non-associative stimulation (which does not change cortical excitability) of the same hand afferents while a third group received no stimulation prior to training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimus (ADM) muscles both prior to and following stimulation and performance of the GPT. In contrast to non-associative stimulation, associative stimulation increased motor cortical excitability, as evidenced by an increase in the amplitude of MEPs evoked in the FDI, one of the stimulated muscles, but not the ADM. Training on the GPT resulted in significant improvements in the time taken to complete the task for all three groups. However, in subjects who had preconditioning associative stimulation, performance on the GPT improved more rapidly. Additionally, there was a strong trend for the improvement in the performance of the stimulated group to be greater than that of the control group.

To determine whether short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) is modulated by fatiguing exercise, we used single and paired-pulse TMS to measure MEP amplitude and SICI for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles of the hand during, and for 20 min after, a 10-min intermittent maximal voluntary abduction of the index finger designed to fatigue the FDI muscle. For the FDI, the index of SICI increased at the onset of exercise (from 0.25+/-0.05 to 0.55+/-0.11, P < 0.05) and then decreased progressively as force declined. At the beginning of recovery, SICI again increased (0.57+/-0.11, P < 0.05) and remained elevated for the 20-min recovery period. In contrast, SICI for ADM did not change during or after exercise. MEP amplitude for both the FDI and ADM increased above baseline during exercise and then decreased below baseline during the recovery period. These results demonstrate that there are significant changes in SICI during and after a fatiguing exercise protocol that are isolated to the representation of the fatigued muscle.

Fourteen volunteers participated (21-30 years) in two randomized sessions; before, during a nerve block of the lingual nerve or topical capsaicin application (30 microl 5%) on the tongue, and after anesthesia or pain had subsided. EMG electrodes were placed on the tongue and the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle (control). EMG signals were amplified, filtered (20 Hz-1 kHz), and sampled at 4 kHz (Nicolet, USA). TMS were delivered with a figure-of-eight coil (Magstim 200, UK). Scalp sites at which EMG responses were evoked in the relaxed tongue or FDI at the lowest stimulus strength were determined, i.e., motor threshold (T). MEPs were assessed using stimulus-response curves in steps of 10% T. Eight stimuli were presented at each stimulus level. The proximal hypoglossal nerve was activated by TMS delivered over the parieto-occipital skull distal to the right ear. Eight stimuli were delivered at 50% of maximum stimulator output. ANOVAs were used to analyze latency and peak-to-peak amplitudes. Capsaicin evoked mild pain (2.8+/-0.5), and a strong burning sensation (6.2+/-0.4) on 0-10 visual analogue scales. MEP amplitudes in tongue and FDI were not influenced by capsaicin (P>0.44) but by stimulus strength (P<0.001). MEP latencies in tongue (8.9+/-0.2 ms) and FDI (22.4+/-0.4 ms) were not affected by capsaicin (P>0.19). Hypoglossal nerve stimulation evoked a short-latency (3.6+/-0.9 ms) response (mean amplitude 65+/-9 microV); but was unaffected by capsaicin (P>0.54). LA did not have any effect on FDI MEPs but was associated with a significant facilitation of tongue MEPs at T+50% and T+60% about 50 min after the nerve block in the recovery phase. Also in this condition, the direct motor responses evoked by hypoglossal nerve stimulation remained constant. No direct effect of a strong burning sensation could be shown on peripheral or central corticomotor pathways to the relaxed tongue musculature, however, LA of the lingual nerve (cranial nerve V) seems able to induce a delayed change in corticomotor control of tongue musculature (cranial nerve XII) possibly related to unmasking effects at the cortical level but not completely excluding excitability changes at the brain stem level.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "Excitability of the pathways mediating the startle reaction before execution of a voluntary movement.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16340396", "authors": ["Kumru, H", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In all trials, the background EMGs (B.EMGs) were kept at the same level in each muscle. Results showed that the target matching errors of dynamic contractions were statistically smaller in the FDI muscle than those in the ADM. In the FDI muscle, the AMT during dynamic contractions was significantly lower than during static ones and the MEPs elicited by TMS were larger during dynamic contractions than those during static ones. However, such results were not found in the ADM muscle. In order to investigate whether the differences were caused by the excitability changes that occurred in the cortical level, the responses elicited by subcortical stimulations were recorded using the same procedures as the experiment of TMS. Responses to subcortical stimulations during dynamic contractions were similar to those during static ones in either muscle.

In a first experiment, we demonstrated that all healthy subjects (N=8) performing index finger abduction in time with an auditory metronome exhibited transitions from syncopation to synchronisation when the metronome tempo was scaled from 0.8 to 2.0 Hz. Subjects' mean transition frequency was 1.7+/-0.2 Hz. In a second experiment, we used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine short-latency intracortical inhibition (sICI) directed towards the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in healthy subjects (N=9) who made synchronised and syncopated phasic finger movements in time with metronome pacing of 1.0 Hz. Despite the equivalence between the patterns in terms of task performance and corticospinal excitability of FDI at this movement frequency, there was significantly greater sICI during syncopation than during synchronisation.

Several groups have attempted to establish a role for the motor cortex in the generation of the facilitatory component of the cutaneomotor reflex. Our aim was to establish if the facilitatory component of the reflex could be diminished by a procedure known to inhibit the motor cortex, namely, subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation. During sustained small contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS), which were subthreshold for the generation of a motor evoked potential, were delivered via a figure-of-eight coil. Inhibition of ongoing EMG was observed in all subjects. In two separate series of trials, TMS was timed so that the resultant inhibition occurred coincident with either the short or long latency stretch reflex or with the initial or later part of the facilitatory component of the cutaneomotor reflex. The short latency stretch reflex is known to involve a largely monosynaptic loop via the spinal cord, whereas the long latency response involves a transcortical loop. The long latency response was reduced in size following subthreshold TMS, whereas the short latency response was unchanged. This provides evidence of the effectiveness of subthreshold TMS in inhibiting a transcortical reflex. When the TMS was timed so that the inhibition occurred coincident with the facilitatory component of the cutaneomotor response, neither the early nor later changes were inhibited. Thus, the pathway of the long-latency cutaneomotor reflex is not similar to the transcortical pathway of the stretch reflex.

Using TMS with paired pulses, mean PT were significantly reduced in MWoA-patients (40.3 +/- 4.9%, P = .017) as well as in MWA-patients (39.6 +/- 4.2%, P = .005) compared with controls (44.6 +/- 6.0%).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), abnormalities in corticostriatal interactions are believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Previously, we have reported that, in healthy subjects, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of motor cortex (MC) induces focal dopamine release in the ipsilateral putamen. In the present study, using [11C]raclopride PET, we sought to investigate early PD patients with evidence of unilateral motor symptoms. We measured in the putamen changes in extracellular dopamine concentration following rTMS (intensity, 90% of the resting motor threshold; frequency, 10 Hz) of the left and right MC. The main objective was to identify potential differences in corticostriatal dopamine release between the hemisphere associated with clear contralateral motor symptoms (symptomatic hemisphere) and the presymptomatic stage of the other hemisphere (asymptomatic hemisphere). Repetitive TMS of MC caused a binding reduction in the ipsilateral putamen of both hemispheres. In the symptomatic hemisphere, while the amount of TMS-induced dopamine release was, as expected, smaller, the size of the significant cluster of change in [11C]raclopride binding was, instead, 61.4% greater than in the asymptomatic hemisphere. This finding of a spatially enlarged area of dopamine release, following cortical stimulation, may represent a possible in vivo expression of a loss of functional segregation of cortical information to the striatum and an indirect evidence of abnormal corticostriatal transmission in early PD. This has potential implications for models of basal ganglia function in PD.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "168", "title": "Evidence for a supraspinal contribution to the human quadriceps long-latency stretch reflex.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16324172", "authors": ["Mrachacz-Kersting, N", "Grey, MJ", "Sinkjaer, T"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

A main projection from the cerebellum to the primary motor cortex is a disynaptic excitatory pathway relayed at the ventral thalamus. This dentatothalamocortical pathway receives inhibitory inputs from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. These pathways (cerebellothalamocortical pathways) have been characterized extensively using cellular approaches in animals. Advances in non-invasive transcranial activation of neural structures using electrical and magnetic stimulation have allowed us to investigate these neural connections in humans. This review summarizes various studies of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway in humans using current transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation techniques. We studied effects on motor cortical excitability elicited by electrical or magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum by recording surface electromyographic (EMG) responses from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Magnetic stimuli were given with a round or figure eight coil (test stimulation) for primary motor cortical activation. For cerebellar stimulation, we gave high-voltage electrical stimuli or magnetic stimuli through a cone-shaped coil ipsilateral to the surface EMG recording (conditioning stimulation). We examined effects of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) with randomized condition-test paradigm, using a test stimulus given preceded by a conditioning stimulus by ISIs of several milliseconds. We demonstrated significant gain of EMG responses at an ISI of 3 ms (facilitatory effect) and reduced responses starting at 5 ms, which lasted 3-7 ms (inhibitory effect). We applied this method to patients with ataxia and showed that the inhibitory effect was only absent in patients with a lesion at cerebellar efferent pathways or dentatothalamocortical pathway. These results imply that this method activates the unilateral cerebellar structures. We confirmed facilitatory and inhibitory natures of cerebellothalamocortical pathways in humans. We can differentiate ataxia attributable to somewhere in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways from that caused by other pathways.", "pages": "141-4"}, {"volume": "187", "title": "ECT and rTMS for depression.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16324129", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "O'Connor, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "Conventional paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques of assessing cortical excitability are limited by fluctuations in the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude.

Studies were undertaken in 26 healthy controls, tracking the MEP response from abductor pollicis brevis. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) occurred up to an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 7-10 ms, with two distinct peaks evident, at ISIs of < or =1 and 3 ms, followed by intracortical facilitation to an ISI of 30 ms. Long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) occurred at ISIs of 50-300 ms, peaking at 150 ms. The present study has confirmed the effectiveness of the threshold tracking TMS technique in reliably and reproducibly measuring cortical excitability. Simultaneous assessment of upper and lower motor neuronal function with threshold tracking techniques may help to determine the site of disease onset and patterns of progression in neurodegenerative diseases.", "pages": "141-4"}]
