Based on the results of electrocorticographic and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings, it has been considered that human rolandic oscillations originate in the anterior bank of the central sulcus (20-Hz rhythm) and the postcentral cortex (10-Hz rhythm): the 20-Hz oscillation is closely related to motor function, while the 10-Hz rhythm is attributed mainly to sensory function. To test whether the rolandic oscillations are functionally relevant to the motor cortical excitability, we examined effects of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left primary motor cortex (M1) on movement-related changes of the rolandic oscillations in 12 normal subjects. MEG data recorded during brisk extension of the right index finger in two different sessions (with and without rTMS conditioning) were compared. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) of the right hand muscle was also measured before and after rTMS to assess the motor cortical excitability. We found that 1-Hz rTMS over M1 significantly reduced the movement-related rebound of the 20-Hz oscillation in association with decreased motor cortical excitability. In particular, movement-related rebound of the 20-Hz rhythm was closely tied with motor cortical excitability. These findings further strengthen the notion of functional relevance of 20-Hz cortical oscillation to motor cortical excitability. In the framework of previous studies, the decrease in movement-related rebound may be regarded as a compensatory reaction to the inhibited cortical activity.", "pages": "160-1"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "The silent period threshold as a measure of corticospinal inhibition.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15935127", "authors": ["Lo, YL", "Fook-Chong, S"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "A novel Hebbian stimulation paradigm was employed to examine physiological correlates of motor memory formation in humans. Repetitive pairing of median nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex (paired associative stimulation, PAS) may decrease human motor cortical excitability at interstimulus intervals of 10 ms (PAS10) or increase excitability at 25 ms (PAS25). The properties of this plasticity have previously been shown to resemble associative timing-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) as established in vitro. Immediately after training a novel dynamic motor task, the capacity of the motor cortex to undergo plasticity in response to PAS25 was abolished. PAS10-induced plasticity remained unchanged. When retested after 6 h, PAS25-induced plasticity recovered to baseline levels. After training, normal PAS25-induced plasticity was observed in the contralateral training-naive motor cortex. Motor training did not reduce the efficacy of PAS25 to enhance cortical excitability when PAS10 was interspersed between the training and application of the PAS25 protocol. This indicated that the mechanism supporting PAS25-induced plasticity had remained intact immediately after training. Behavioral evidence was obtained for continued optimization of force generation at a time when PAS25-induced plasticity was blocked in the training motor cortex. Application of the PAS protocols after motor training did not prevent the consolidation of motor skills evident as performance gains at later retesting. The results are consistent with a concept of temporary suppression of associative cortical plasticity by neuronal mechanisms involved in motor training. Although it remains an open question exactly which element of motor training was responsible for this effect, our findings may link dynamic properties of LTP formation, as established in animal experiments, with human motor memory formation and possibly dynamic motor learning.", "pages": "160-1"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Functional relationship between human rolandic oscillations and motor cortical excitability: an MEG study.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "15261700", "authors": ["Tamura, Y", "Hoshiyama, M", "Nakata, H", "Hiroe, N", "Inui, K", "Kaneoke, Y", "Inoue, K", "Kakigi, R"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Postmortem and structural imaging studies suggest that patients with schizophrenia have disrupted cerebellar activity.

In addition, we examined the effect of different coil orientations on perception of phosphenes induced by paired-pulse TMS.

We defined the TS as being supra-threshold when it caused a significant increase or decrease in the visually evoked activity. By systematically varying the interstimulus interval (ISI) between 2 and 30 ms and the strength of CS within the range 15-130% of TS, we found a clear dependence of the ppTMS effect on CS strength but little relation to ISI. The CS effect was strongest with an ISI of 3 ms and steadily declined for longer ISIs. A switch from enhancement of intracortical inhibition at short ISIs (2-5 ms, SICI) to intracortical facilitation (ICF) at longer ISIs (7-30 ms), as demonstrated for human motor cortex, was not evident. Whether the CS caused facilitation or suppression of the TS effect mainly depended on the strength of CS and the polarity of the TS effect: within a range of 60-130% a positive correlation between ppTMS and TS effect was evident, resulting in a stronger facilitation if the TS caused facilitation of visual activity, and more suppression if the TS was suppressive by itself. The correlation inverted when CS was reduced to 15-30%. The ppTMS effect was not simply the sum of the CS and TS effect, it was much smaller at weak CS strength (15-50%) but stronger than the sum of CS and TS effects at CS strength 60-100%.

This brain region is known to play an important role in the control of saccades. We wanted to investigate whether the fast rTMS procedure affected saccadic activity in depression. Reflexive saccades (RS) and voluntary saccades were studied in 11 patients before and after therapeutic rTMS for depression. Two types of voluntary saccade tasks were used: a voluntary prosaccade (VpS) task and an antisaccade (AS) task. Eye movements were registered by infrared oculography. Latency and directional error rate were analyzed. rTMS was applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). RS and VpS parameters were unchanged after 10 sessions of rTMS. However, the latency of antisaccades (AS) was significantly shorter after rTMS than before rTMS. It can be concluded that rTMS over the left DLPFC cortex in depression seems to have no important effect on reflexive saccades, while antisaccade activity is clearly favored by shortening of latency. As voluntary prosaccades were not significantly influenced, our findings may indicate that not merely the voluntary triggering of saccades but the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades is influenced by fast rTMS delivered over the DLPFC.

TMS was applied at 80 and 100 ms after target onset in the gap task, and after fixation offset in the delay task. Without TMS, we confirmed a latency asymmetry in the gap task favouring upward saccades at the lower eccentricity (7.5 degrees ), and a latency symmetry in the delay task. TMS increased the latencies of all saccades in the delay task, when delivered at 100 ms. This effect was mostly pronounced for downward saccades at 7.5 degrees . As a result, saccade latencies showed an asymmetry in this condition, similar to the one observed in the gap task without TMS. The gap task with TMS resulted in a variable latency distribution and no significant overall effect on saccade latency.

After treatment, imaging is being used to quantify the treatment response and the extent of residual tumor. At follow-up, imaging helps to determine tumor progression and to differentiate recurrent tumor growth from treatment-induced tissue changes, such as radiation necrosis. A variety of complementary imaging methods are currently being used to obtain all the information necessary to achieve the above mentioned goals. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal mostly anatomical information on the tumor, whereas magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) give important information on the metabolic state and molecular events within the tumor. Functional MRI and functional PET, in combination with electrophysiological methods like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being used to delineate functionally important neuronal tissue, which has to be preserved from treatment-induced damage, as well as to gather information on tumor-induced brain plasticity.

The voluntary contraction was the task provoking maximal facilitation in the UH, whereas a similar degree of facilitation was obtained during voluntary contraction and motor imagery in the AH.

A paired-pulse method with a conditioning stimulus (CS) to the motor cortex (M1) followed by a test stimulus to the opposite M1 was used to study the interhemispheric inhibition (ppIHI). Both CS and TS were adjusted to produce motor-evoked potentials of approximately 1 mV in the contralateral FDI muscles.

One possibility is that homeostatic mechanisms that keep cortical excitability within a normal physiological range are impaired. In eight patients with writer's cramp and eight healthy age-matched controls, we combined low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) to probe regional homeostatic plasticity of the left M1. Confirming our previous study (Siebner et al., J Neurosci 2004; 24: 3379-85), 'facilitatory' preconditioning of the M1 with anodal TDCS enhanced the inhibitory effect of subsequent 1 Hz rTMS on corticospinal excitability. Conversely, 'inhibitory' preconditioning with cathodal TDCS reversed the after effect of 1 Hz rTMS, producing an increase in corticospinal excitability. The results were quite different in patients with writer's cramp. Following preconditioning with TDCS, 1 Hz rTMS induced no consistent changes in corticospinal excitability, indicating a loss of the normal 'homeostatic' response pattern. In addition, the normal inhibitory effect of preconditioning with cathodal TDCS was absent. The present data suggest that homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize excitability levels within a useful dynamic range are impaired in patients with writer's cramp.

They include a more efficient excitation of inhibiting circuits by posteriorly oriented pulses, and a back-propagating D-wave inhibiting early I-waves and thus inducing early inhibition of MEP amplitude.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured as a marker of synaptic activity at rest and during freely selected finger movements.

In these studies, the subjects can predict the TMS timings. Thus we investigated how the predictability of TMS timing affects cortico-spinal excitability. A single-pulse TMS was delivered to the hand section of the left motor cortex while seven right-handed subjects relaxed their hands in a flexed position. We prepared three conditions: (i) in the semi-PREDICTABLE condition, two visual stimuli at 500 ms interval were presented and the TMS was delivered either 0, 125, 250, 375, or 500 ms after the first stimulus; (ii) in the PREDICTABLE condition, the TMS was provided only at 500 ms after the first stimulus; (iii) in the UNPREDICTABLE condition, no visual cue preceded the TMS. We recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the wrist flexor and extensor muscles. We found a significant reduction of MEP amplitude in the flexor muscles in both the PREDICTABLE and semi-PREDICTABLE conditions, but not in the UNPREDICTABLE condition. These results showed that the predictability of TMS per se, without the preparation of motor outputs, can reduce cortico-spinal excitability.", "pages": "160-1"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Cortical hyperexcitability in post-traumatic stress disorder secondary to minor accidental head trauma: a neurophysiologic study.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12578221", "authors": ["Centonze, D", "Palmieri, MG", "Boffa, L", "Pierantozzi, M", "Stanzione, P", "Brusa, L", "Marciani, M", "Siracusano, A", "Bernardi, G", "Caramia, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN", "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathy and autonomic nervous system neuropathy are recognized as the most common clinical pictures of nervous system disorders caused by diabetes mellitus (DM).

Here we describe a timing-based associative form of plasticity in human somatosensory cortex. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) was performed by combining repetitive median nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral postcentral region. PAS increased exclusively the amplitude of the P25 component of the median nerve-evoked somatosensory-evoked potential (MN-SSEP), which is probably generated in the superficial cortical layers of area 3b. SSEP components reflecting neuronal activity in deeper cortical layers (N20 component) or subcortical regions (P14 component) remained constant. PAS-induced enhancement of P25 amplitude displayed topographical specificity both for the recording (MN-SSEP versus tibial nerve-SSEP) and the stimulation (magnetic stimulation targeting somatosensory versus motor cortex) arrangements. Modulation of P25 amplitude was confined to a narrow range of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between the MN pulse and the TMS pulse, and the sign of the modulation changed with ISIs differing by only 15 ms. The function describing the ISI dependence of PAS effects on somatosensory cortex resembled one previously observed in motor cortex, shifted by approximately 7 ms. The findings suggest a simple model of modulation of excitability in human primary somatosensory cortex, possibly by mechanisms related to the spike-timing-dependent plasticity of neuronal synapses located in upper cortical layers.", "pages": "160-1"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation effects on one-trial learning and response to anxiogenic stimuli in adult male rats.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9974066", "authors": ["Hedges, DW", "Higginbotham, BJ", "Salyer, DL", "Lund, TD"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "In four conscious patients who had electrodes implanted in the cervical epidural space for the control of pain, we recorded corticospinal volleys evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex before and after a 20 s period of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS). It has previously been reported that this form of repetitive TMS reduces the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), with the maximum effect occurring at 5-10 min after the end of stimulation. The present results show that cTBS preferentially decreases the amplitude of the corticospinal I1 wave, with approximately the same time course. This is consistent with a cortical origin of the effect on the MEP. However, other protocols that lead to MEP suppression, such as short-interval intracortical inhibition, are characterized by reduced excitability of late I waves (particularly I3), suggesting that cTBS suppresses MEPs through different mechanisms, such as long-term depression in excitatory synaptic connections.", "pages": "160-1"}]
