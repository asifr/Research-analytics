Herein we aimed to study the effects of these two techniques combined on CSD. Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided into four groups according to the treatment: sham tDCS/sham ES, sham tDCS/1 Hz ES, anodal tDCS/1 Hz ES, cathodal tDCS/1 Hz ES. Our findings show that 1 Hz ES reduced CSD velocity, and this effect was modified by either anodal or cathodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS induced larger effects than cathodal tDCS. Hereby CSD velocity was actually increased significantly after anodal tDCS/1 Hz ES. Our results show that combining two techniques of brain stimulation can modify significantly the effects of ES alone on cortical excitability as measured by the neurophysiological parameter of cortical spreading depression and therefore provide important insights into the effects of this new approach of brain stimulation on cortical activity.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Insights into the bilateral cortical control of human masticatory muscles revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17112459", "authors": ["Nordstrom, MA"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Archives of oral biology", "abstract": "In this brief review I describe details of the functional organisation of the bilateral corticobulbar projections to the trigeminally innervated masticatory muscles, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human brain. The motor cortices of both hemispheres are involved in control of trigeminal motoneurons, however the contralateral hemisphere has the greater excitatory influence. Corticomotoneuronal cells in each hemisphere project to jaw-closer and jaw-opener motoneurons. Less is known about cortically mediated inhibitory effects in the trigeminal motor system, but the available evidence suggests that drive to jaw muscles on each side is affected similarly by intracortical inhibitory processes activated in one hemisphere. Functional studies reveal that the two hemispheres play distinct roles in control of ipsilateral and contralateral muscles, particularly for jaw-closers. Masseter and digastric motor units recruited during low-force contractions do not receive uniform inputs from each hemisphere; the majority of masseter motor units are excited only from the contralateral hemisphere, and while digastric motor units are usually excited from both hemispheres the direct CM cell influence appears to be augmented on the contralateral side by corticobulbar activation of segmental excitatory interneurons. Differences in bilateral cortical control of jaw-closer and jaw-opener muscles may contribute to the more independent control of jaw-closers on each side during functional tasks. Corticobulbar control of the trigeminal muscles during natural tasks such as chewing and speech remains to be investigated with TMS.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Brain imaging of clinical pain states: a critical review and strategies for future studies.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "17110284", "authors": ["Kupers, R", "Kehlet, H"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Research into brain imaging of pain is largely dominated by experimental acute-pain studies. Applied study paradigms have evolved a lot over past years and the ensuing results have furthered enormously our understanding of acute-pain processing. In sharp contrast, published work on brain-imaging in chronic pain remains scant. Furthermore, the results of these studies are highly incongruent, which could be explained by the fact that patient populations studied varied largely in terms of pain history, pain distribution, cause of pain, and psychological set-up. To circumvent these problems, several investigators have used surrogate models of neuropathic pain, but the validity of these models is highly questionable. In this Review we critically discuss the problems and shortcomings of most published reports on chronic pain and we propose some strategies for future studies. We argue that the post-operative pain model is highly appealing since it opens perspectives for prospective longitudinal studies with repeated assessments and it enables control for many confounding factors, which hamper the interpretation of most current studies. We also plead for a multimodal imaging approach in which classic brain-activation studies are supplemented with genetic, neurochemistry, brain morphometry, and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Emerging treatments for depression.", "issue": "17", "pmid": "17109609", "authors": ["Holtzheimer, PE", "Nemeroff, CB"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy", "abstract": "Established treatments for depression are often effective.

Currently, there is evidence from clinical studies suggesting that treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may improve schizophrenia symptoms. Our review provides an overview of clinical rTMS studies in schizophrenic patients. A systematic search of the literature (Cochrane and Medline databases up to December 2005) was conducted. Most studies showed methodological problems due to their explorative character and small sample sizes. In some studies, a treatment effect of high-frequency rTMS applied over the prefrontal cortex was seen with respect to negative symptoms. On the other hand, low-frequency rTMS in the temporal lobe area might lead to a suppression of auditory hallucinations. It is concluded that larger sham-controlled studies are required to allow an adequate assessment of the clinical and neurobiological effects of rTMS in schizophrenic patients.

First, we found that maximum finger tapping speed is a matter of training as shown for professional musicians. Secondly, we demonstrated that different finger tapping speeds are accompanied by different hemodynamic responses in the primary hand motor area (M1), the cerebellum and partly in pre-motor areas. With increasing tapping speed there is an increase of hemodynamic response in these areas (rate effect). Thirdly, the effect measured with fMRI is substantiated by rate effects measured by means of task-related power decreases in the upper alpha-band (10-12 Hz) over the primary motor cortex. In case of sequential finger movement learning, we observed decreases in task-related alpha-power in lateral PMC (event-related desynchronization: ERD) and simultaneous alpha-power increases in SMA (event-related synchronization: ERS) that came along with training-induced increases in movement rate. This pattern is discussed in relation to the \"focal ERD/surround ERS\" phenomenon suggested by Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva. Finally, we demonstrated that finger tapping speed was slowed by selectively inhibiting the primary hand motor area using TMS. Taken together, these studies demonstrate on the basis of converging evidence that the primary hand motor area is the basic control centre for controlling the movement parameter tapping speed.

For semantic memory performance we have found that resting or reference power is positively associated with performance, whereas during actual processing of the task, small power--reflected by a large extent of event-related desynchronization (ERD)--is related to good performance. We also have shown that the induction of large alpha reference power by neurofeedback training or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at individual alpha frequency mimicked exactly the situation which is typical for good memory performance under normal situations: increased alpha reference power is associated with large ERD and good performance. Recent studies have demonstrated that this relationship holds true only for memory and not perceptual tasks that require the identification of simple visual stimuli under difficult conditions. In contrast to good memory performance, good perceptual performance is related to small pre-stimulus alpha power and a small ERD. We interpret this finding in terms of cortical inhibition vs. activation preceding task performance by assuming that large rhythmic alpha activity reflects inhibition. We assume that small reference alpha enhances perceptual performance because the cortex is activated and prepared to process the stimulus, whereas memory performance is enhanced if the cortex is deactivated before a task is performed because in typical memory tasks selective processing can start only after the to-be-remembered item or cue is presented. We also suggest that conflicting results about alpha ERD and the neural efficiency hypothesis (which assumes that highly intelligent exhibit a small ERD) can also be interpreted in terms of inhibition. Only if an intelligence test actually requires the activation of (semantic) memory, a large (because task specific) ERD can be observed.

To this end, we investigated the relationship between the input-output curves of the corticospinal pathway (i.e., the relationship between the stimulus intensities vs. the area of motor-evoked potentials) during lengthening and shortening contractions in 17 healthy subjects. The shape of this relationship was sigmoidal and characterized by a plateau value, maximum slope, and threshold. The plateau value was at the same level between lengthening and shortening contractions. However, the maximum slope (P < 0.01) and threshold (P < 0.01) were significantly higher during lengthening contractions than during shortening contractions. These findings were different from the results of other muscles tested in previous studies (i.e., the soleus muscle and the elbow flexors). That is to say, the plateau value and the maximum slope during lengthening contractions were significantly lower than those during shortening contractions in previous studies.

Clinical investigation into the treatment of chronic pain after thalamic infarction has shown improvement in motor function when pain relief is achieved with motor cortex stimulation. More recently, laboratory studies in rats and primates demonstrate significant improvement in forelimb reaching tasks in rats and primates after induced ischemic cortical infarction when rehabilitation is paired with stimulation of the injured cortex and cortical margin at low frequency (50 Hz). Structural changes have also been observed. Dendritic density in layer V of the cortex near the lesion increases after cortical stimulation, consistent with a restorative cortical plasticity. Also, stimulation combined with rehabilitation increases the area of the injured cortex from which movements can be evoked in response to stimulation of the injured cortex in rats. Unilateral cortical stimulation reduces secondary cortical hyperexcitability in the impaired hemisphere after stroke. These findings form the basis for the first clinical study motor cortex stimulation after chronic stroke in humans. A prospective, randomized multicenter study of subthreshold motor cortical electrical stimulation during rehabilitation in patients has been completed. The eight patients entered into this study had weakness from a stroke that occurred at least four months before enrollment. Results demonstrate that the treatment is safe.

Neuroimaging investigations in schizophrenia suggest abnormalities in the prefrontal and temporoparietal cortex (TPC), which are correlated with psychopathological dimensions. Based on its modulatory effect, rTMS seems to be a promising tool in exploring cortical excitability and reducing auditory hallucinations (AH) and negative symptoms. Neurophysiologic studies of patients suffering from schizophrenia using rTMS indicate high cortical excitability and a lack of transcallosal inhibition.

This article reviews all studies using this technique in dystonia and discusses rTMS therapeutic impact and its possible mechanisms of action in this indication. Currently, the premotor cortex seems to be the best target for rTMS in dystonia. Rather than merely reducing the hyperexcitability of the primary motor cortex, this technique's clinical benefit seems to result from modifications in plasticity and restoration of sensorimotor integration. The corollary technique for chronic rTMS is electrical cortical stimulation. Even though this new therapeutic tool may have therapeutic promise, more studies are required to confirm it. In particular, we need to broaden our knowledge of rTMS impact on the various forms of dystonia and to optimize target localization.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "One session of high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the right prefrontal cortex transiently reduces cocaine craving.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "12625638", "authors": ["Camprodon, JA", "Mart\u00ednez-Raga, J", "Alonso-Alonso, M", "Shih, MC", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Drug and alcohol dependence", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potent tool that can be used to modify activity of targeted cortical areas. Significant clinical effects have been obtained in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by stimulating different cortical regions with rTMS at inhibitory (low) or excitatory (high) frequency. These effects were thought to result from plastic changes in motor cortical networks. Actually cortical dysfunction has been documented in PD by neuroimaging and neurophysiologic studies showing either hypo- or hyper-activation of various brain areas. In addition, cortical excitability studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation disclosed significant alterations in intracortical facilitatory or inhibitory processes according to the resting state or to phases of movement preparation or execution. These observations clearly support the therapeutic potential of cortical neuromodulation in PD. Motor cortex stimulation could impact on any station within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops that are involved in motor control, providing alleviation of parkinsonian symptoms. Depending on the target, cortical stimulation might improve motor performance or other symptoms associated with PD, like depression. Clinical application of rTMS to treat PD patients is limited by the short duration of the effects beyond the time of stimulation, even if long-lasting improvements have been observed after repeated rTMS sessions. In any case, the place of cortical stimulation in the therapeutic management of PD patients remains to be determined, as an alternative or a complementary technique to deep brain stimulation. The rTMS technique could be used to better define the targets and the parameters of stimulation subsequently applied in chronic epidural stimulation.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "296", "title": "Advances seen in mood disorders research.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "15174016", "authors": ["Lamberg, L"], "year": "2006", "journal": "JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association", "abstract": "Chronic motor cortex stimulation using implanted epidural stimulation was proposed to treat chronic, drug-resistant neuropathic pain. Various studies showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the motor cortex could also relieve neuropathic pain, at least partially and transiently. Controlled rTMS studies with other cortical targets, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, are in waiting. The mechanisms of action of rTMS on chronic pain are mostly unknown. The changes induced by rTMS in neural activities may occur at the stimulated cortical site as well as in remote structures along functional anatomical connections. Compared to chronic implanted procedure, the main limitation of rTMS application is the short duration of clinical effects. Repeated daily rTMS sessions have proved some efficacy to induce long-lasting pain relief that could have therapeutic potential. However, rTMS-induced analgesia varies with the site and parameters of stimulation, in particular the stimulus rate. The efficacious rTMS parameters could differ from those used in chronic epidural stimulation. Differences in the pattern of the current fields respectively induced in the brain by these two techniques might explain this finding. Actually, stimulation parameters remain to be optimised and clinical efficacy to be confirmed by multicentre randomised trials, before considering rTMS as therapeutic tool for patients with chronic pain in neurological practice.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "140", "title": "Contribution of religiousness in the prediction and interpretation of mystical experiences in a sensory deprivation context: activation of religious schemas.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "15142954", "authors": ["Granqvist, P", "Larsson, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The Journal of psychology", "abstract": "Post-stroke recovery is based on plastic changes in the central nervous system that can compensate the loss of activity in affected brain regions. In particular, monohemispheric stroke is thought to result in disinhibition of the contralesional unaffected hemisphere. Neurorehabilitation programs improve function partly by enhancing cortical reorganization. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive way of producing potent changes in cortical excitability. Therefore, the application of rTMS was recently proposed to promote functional recovery in stroke patients, owing to the induced neuroplasticity. This review discusses the first clinical results that were obtained by rTMS in patients with post-stroke motor deficit, visuospatial neglect, or aphasia. These results are promising and depend on the site and frequency of stimulation. In summary, functional recovery might be obtained either when rTMS is applied at low-frequency (around 1 Hz) over the disinhibited, unaffected hemisphere in order to restore defective inhibition or when rTMS is applied at high-frequency (5 Hz or more) over the affected hemisphere in order to reactivate hypoactive regions. The overall procedure remains to be optimized, in particular regarding the number of rTMS sessions and the time of rTMS application after stroke. Cortical stimulation is an exciting perspective for improving functional recovery from stroke. Transient application of non-invasive transcranial stimulation during the time of the rehabilitation process will be preferable to the temporary implantation of epidural cortical electrodes, as recently proposed. Therefore, in the future, acute or recent stroke might be a major indication of rTMS in neurological practice.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Non-pharmacological treatments in the management of rapid cycling bipolar disorder.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "15378041", "authors": ["Papadimitriou, GN", "Dikeos, DG", "Soldatos, CR", "Calabrese, JR"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive technique allowing stimulating neurons in the cerebral cortex, is able to modify durably local as well as distant neuronal activity.

The behavioral consequences in such instances can be adaptive or maladaptive. As would be expected, constraint-induced movement therapy (CI therapy), which has been found to be beneficial for chronic stroke hemiparesis, has been repeatedly associated with significant plastic brain changes in a variety of studies that have included transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or other approaches. In some instances, the initial degree of brain reorganization occurred in parallel with the improvement in spontaneous, real-world use by the more-affected hand, which suggests that plastic brain changes in some manner support therapeutic effects. However, the studies are also inconsistent with respect to whether the reorganization changes occur more in the lesioned vs unlesioned hemisphere. Interpreting the physiological outcomes post-treatment is compromised by inconsistencies in study design in the nature of treatment administered, participant recruitment, imaging modality, and extent of follow-up. Improved understanding of the biological basis for neuroplasticity in CI therapy may be obtained through rigorous control of study approaches and through evaluating treatment changes with more than one modality in the same patients concurrently. New quantitative structural brain imaging techniques may allow measuring morphological changes following CI therapy to test hypotheses of regional brain recruitment in use-dependent therapy while avoiding the variability of functional imaging and mapping techniques and the difficulties and assumptions imposed by requiring active limb movement during scanning.", "pages": "R962-3"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Aiming to stimulate better outcomes.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "15494583", "authors": ["Hagland, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Behavioral healthcare", "abstract": "The excitability of the human motor cortex projecting to hand muscles can be reduced by theta burst transcranial magnetic repetitive stimulation (TBS).
