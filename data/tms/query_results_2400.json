Can stroke patients improve voluntary control of their paretic ankle by practising a visuo-motor ankle-tracking task? 2. Are practice effects enhanced with non-invasive brain stimulation? A carefully selected sample of chronic stroke patients able to perform the experimental task attended three data collection sessions. Facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied in a random order over the lower limb primary motor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere or the non-lesioned hemisphere or sham stimulation was delivered over the lesioned hemisphere. In each session, tDCS was applied as patients practiced tracking a sinusoidal waveform for 15\u00a0min using dorsiflexion-plantarflexion movements of their paretic ankle. The difference in tracking error prior to, and after, the 15\u00a0min of practice was calculated. A practice effect was revealed following sham stimulation, and this effect was enhanced with tDCS applied over the lesioned hemisphere. The practice effect observed following sham stimulation was eliminated by tDCS applied over the non-lesioned hemisphere. The study provides the first evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation applied to the lesioned motor cortex of moderate- to well-recovered stroke patients enhances voluntary control of the paretic ankle. The results provide a basis for examining whether this enhanced ankle control can be induced in patients with greater impairments and whether enhanced control of a single or multiple lower limb joints improves hemiparetic gait patterns.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "209", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation enhances fine motor control of the hemiparetic ankle: implications for rehabilitation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21170708", "authors": ["Madhavan, S", "Weber, KA", "Stinear, JW"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

While VSTM is usually broken down into iconic memory (brief and high-capacity store) and visual working memory (sustained, yet limited-capacity store), recent studies have suggested the existence of an additional and intermediate form of VSTM that depends on activity in extrastriate cortex. In previous work, we have shown that this fragile form of VSTM can be dissociated from iconic memory. In the present study, we provide evidence that fragile VSTM is different from visual working memory as magnetic stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) disrupts visual working memory, while leaving fragile VSTM intact. In addition, we observed that people with high DLPFC activity had superior working memory capacity compared to people with low DLPFC activity, and only people with high DLPFC activity really showed a reduction in working memory capacity in response to magnetic stimulation. Altogether, this study shows that VSTM consists of three stages that have clearly different characteristics and rely on different neural structures. On the methodological side, we show that it is possible to predict individual susceptibility to magnetic stimulation based on functional MRI activity.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Magnetic stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dissociates fragile visual short-term memory from visual working memory.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "21168424", "authors": ["Sligte, IG", "Wokke, ME", "Tesselaar, JP", "Scholte, HS", "Lamme, VA"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "To study the modifications induced by training of a coordinated movement on the primary motor cortex (M1) maps of one proximal muscle and one distal muscle activated alone and during their co-contraction.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Plasticity of motor cortex induced by coordination and training.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21168091", "authors": ["Ty\u010d, F", "Boyadjian, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Six healthy female sport students performed a 6-week training program during which they were trained in darts 3-4 times a week.

Previous work has explored the chronometry of occipital involvement in vision by using single pulses of TMS with high temporal resolution. However, conventionally TMS intensities have been high and the only measure used to evaluate masking was objective in nature. Recent studies have begun to incorporate subjective measures of vision, alongside objective ones. The current study goes beyond previous work in two regards. First, we explored both objective vision (an orientation discrimination task) and subjective vision (a stimulus visibility rating on a four-point scale), across a wide range of time windows with high temporal resolution. Second, we used a very sensitive TMS-masking paradigm: stimulation was at relatively low TMS intensities, with a figure-8 coil, and the small stimulus was difficult to discriminate already at baseline level. We hypothesized that this should increase the effective temporal resolution of our paradigm. Perhaps for this reason, we are able to report a rather interesting masking curve. Within the classical-masking time window, previously reported to encompass broad SOAs anywhere between 60 and 120\u00a0ms, we report not one, but at least two dips in objective performance, with no masking in-between.

The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced behavioral changes have been sparsely studied, especially in humans. Global cholinergic activation focuses on plasticity in humans. However, the specific contribution of nicotinic receptors to these effects is unclear. Henceforth, we explored the impact of nicotine on non-focal neuroplasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and focal, synapse-specific plasticity induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS) in healthy non-smoking individuals. Forty-eight subjects participated in the study. Each subject received placebo and nicotine patches combined with one of the stimulation protocols to the primary motor cortex in different sessions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were recorded as a measure of corticospinal excitability until the evening of the second day following the stimulation. Nicotine abolished or reduced both PAS- and tDCS-induced inhibitory neuroplasticity. Non-focal facilitatory plasticity was also abolished, whereas focal facilitatory plasticity was slightly prolonged by nicotine. Thus, nicotinergic influence on facilitatory, but not inhibitory plasticity mimics that of global cholinergic enhancement. Therefore, activating nicotinic receptors has clearly discernable effects from global cholinergic activation.

Long interpulse interval (50-500 ms) ppTMS (LI-ppTMS) provokes intracortical inhibitory circuits and can reveal pathologically impaired cortical inhibition in disorders such as epilepsy. Adaptation of ppTMS protocols to rodent disease models is highly desirable to facilitate basic and translational research. We previously adapted single-pulse TMS (spTMS) methods to rats, but ppTMS has yet to be applied. Specifically, whether ppTMS elicits an inhibitory response in rodents is unknown. ppTMS in rats also requires anesthesia, a setting under which the preservation of these measures is undetermined. We therefore tested, in anesthetized rats, whether anesthetic choice affects spTMS-motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), LI-ppTMS in rats, as in humans, elicits intracortical inhibition of the MEP, and rat LI-ppTMS inhibition is acutely impaired in a seizure model. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (PB) or ketamine-atropine-xylazine (KAX) and stimulated unilaterally over the motor cortex while recording bilateral brachioradialis MEPs. LI-ppTMS was applied analogous to human long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) protocols, and acute changes in inhibition were evaluated following injection of the convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). We find that spTMS-evoked MEPs were reliably present under either anesthetic, and that LI-ppTMS elicits inhibition of the conditioned MEP in rats, similar to human LICI, by as much as 58 \u00b1 12 and 71 \u00b1 11% under PB and KAX anesthesia, respectively. LI-ppTMS inhibition was reduced to as much as 53% of saline controls following PTZ injection, while spTMS-derived measures of corticospinal excitability were unchanged. Our data show that regional inhibition, similar to human LICI, is present in rats, can be elicited under PB or KAX anesthesia, and is reduced following convulsant administration.

In experiment 1 (n = 14), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied during 10% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) finger flexion force production or at rest.

Similarly, in experiment 2 (n = 11), electrical stimulation (ES) was applied to FDS or EDC during the described four breathing conditions while subjects maintained 10%MVC of finger flexion or extension and at rest. In the exploratory clinical experiments (experiment 3), four patients with chronic neurological disorders (three strokes, one traumatic brain injury) received a 30-min session of breathing-controlled ES to the impaired EDC. In experiment 1, the EDC MEP magnitudes increased significantly during IN and OUT at both 10%MVC and rest; the FDS MEPs were enhanced only at 10%MVC, whereas the ADM MEP increased only during OUT, compared with NORM for both at rest and 10%MVC. No difference was found between NORM and HOLD for all three muscles. In experiment 2, when FDS was stimulated, force response was enhanced during both IN and OUT, but only at 10%MVC. When EDC was stimulated, force response increased at both 10%MVC and rest, only during IN, but not OUT. The averaged response latency was 83 ms for the finger extensors and 79 ms for the finger flexors. After a 30-min intervention of ES to EDC triggered by forced inspiration in experiment 3, we observed a significant reduction in finger flexor spasticity. The spasticity reduction lasted for \u2265 4 wk in all four patients. TMS and ES data, collectively, support the phenomenon that there is an overall respiration-related enhancement on the motor system, with a strong inspiration-finger extension coupling during voluntary breathing.

This 'standard' form of rTMS clearly appears to have antidepressant efficacy, and its effects have now been confirmed in several large-scale clinical trials and a number of meta-analyses: response is better than that of sham stimulation, although the number of responders to treatment is relatively modest. A wide range of alternative forms of rTMS have been, or are currently being, evaluated. Low-frequency stimulation applied to the right prefrontal cortex appears to have similar efficacy to standard treatment and it is possible that the bilateral approaches may prove more effective. Novel methods of stimulation, such as priming stimulation, theta-burst stimulation and deep TMS, appear to be promising although require further evaluation.

However, this view has not always been supported by empirical studies. Employing a lateralized design and two different semantic tasks and a nonsemantic control task, we aimed to clarify some of these ambiguities by potentially dissociating left from right functionality and social from nonsocial concepts, using inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) coupled with a sham and control site stimulation (N = 56). The results showed that stimulation of the left ATL led to overall faster processing times without affecting accuracy, whilst the right ATL and control groups did not significantly change in reaction times or accuracy. No difference occurred between social and nonsocial concepts after stimulation. This study is the first to show that inhibition of the left temporal lobe may improve performance on a semantic task and provides evidence that the ATLs may be lateralized in conceptual processing.

Thus, in the present review we discuss the use of these techniques as a tool to study underlying cortical mechanisms during healthy aging and as an interventional strategy to enhance declining functions and learning abilities in aged subjects.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "489", "title": "A transcranial magnetic stimulation study of corticospinal excitability during the observation of meaningless, goal-directed, and social behaviour.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21161183", "authors": ["Donne, CM", "Enticott, PG", "Rinehart, NJ", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "The use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess changes in cortical excitability is a tool used with increased prevalence in healthy and impaired populations.

We understand that ADTs promote synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. This promotion is linked with stimulation of dopaminergic receptors. Previous evidence shows that all ADTs (chemical, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, sleep deprivation) increase at least one monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) or dopamine (DA); this article focuses on DA release or turn-over in the frontal cortex. DA increased dopaminergic activation promotes synaptic plasticity with an inverted U shape dose-response curve. Specific interaction between DA and glutamate is mediated by D1 receptor subtypes and Glutamate (NMDA) receptors with neurotrophic factors likely to play a modulatory role. With the understanding that all ADTs have a common, final, DA-ergic stimulation that promotes synaptic plasticity we can predict that (1) AD efficiency is related to the compound strength for inducing DA-ergic stimulation. (2) ADT efficiency presents a therapeutic window that coincides with the inverted U shape DA response curve. (3) ADT delay of action is related to a \"synaptogenesis and neurogenesis delay of action.\" (4) The minimum efficient dose can be found by starting at a low dosage and increasing up to the patient response. (5) An increased tolerance requires a concomitant prescription of a few ADTs, with different or opposite adverse effects, at a very low dose. (6) ADTs could improve all diseases with cognitive impairments and synaptic depression by increasing synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Contributions of the motor cortex to adaptive control of reaching depend on the perturbation schedule.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "14724259", "authors": ["Orban de Xivry, JJ", "Criscimagna-Hemminger, SE", "Shadmehr, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the primary motor cortex (M1) produces a series of corticospinal descending waves, with a direct (D) wave followed by several indirect (I) waves.

However, it is not known whether I-waves elicited by different current directions are mediated by the same neuronal populations. We studied the neuronal mechanisms mediating I-waves by examining the influence of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) on various I-waves. SAI was tested with electrical median nerve stimulation at the wrist followed by TMS to the contralateral M1 at different current directions. Surface electromyograms and single motor units were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. SAI was weaker for the AP compared with that for the PA current direction. With increasing median nerve stimulation intensities, SAI increased for the PA direction but showed a U-shaped relationship for the AP direction. SAI produced more inhibition of late I-waves generated by PA than those generated by AP current direction.

Three groups of 12 volunteers were selected at random and given active stimulation (frequency 10Hz, at 80% motor threshold intensity, 1500 pulses per session) of the right M1, active stimulation of the right DLPFC, or sham stimulation, during two experimental sessions 2 weeks apart. Cold pain thresholds and the intensity of pain induced by a series of fixed-temperature cold stimuli (5, 10, and 15\u00b0C) were used to evaluate the analgesic effects of rTMS. Measurements were made at the left thenar eminence, before and 1 hour after the intravenous injection of naloxone (bolus of 0.1mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1mg/kg/h until the end of rTMS) or placebo (saline). Naloxone injection significantly decreased the analgesic effects of M1 stimulation, but did not change the effects of rTMS of the DLPFC or sham rTMS. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the involvement of endogenous opioid systems in rTMS-induced analgesia. The differential effects of naloxone on M1 and DLPFC stimulation suggest that the analgesic effects induced by the stimulation of these 2 cortical sites are mediated by different mechanisms.

To address this issue, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to interfere with the functioning of the anterior part of the right or left supramarginalis gyrus (SMG), a region critically involved in object-directed actions. rTMS was delivered in healthy participants performing four judgment tasks designed to explore different aspects of manipulation and conceptual knowledge of man-made objects. The two manipulation judgment tasks consisted in determining whether (1) two objects displayed on a computer screen are normally used by adopting a comparable hand posture, or (2) a given hand posture is appropriate to use an object. In the two conceptual judgment tasks, subjects had to decide whether (1) two objects displayed on the computer screen are normally used in the same context or (2) they are functionally related. We found that virtual lesions of left SMG interfere only with the performance of the manipulation judgment task in which subjects had to decide whether two different objects are used by adopting the same hand posture, all the other tasks being unaltered. rTMS applied over the right SMG had no effect.

If such cortical processes do indeed facilitate social understanding, then cortical activity during action observation might be further enhanced when observing behaviour embedded within a social, interactive context. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was administered to 27 healthy adults, and corticospinal excitability (CSE), which is a putative measure of the mirror system, was examined during the observation of (1) meaningless behaviour, (2) goal-directed behaviour, and (3) social behaviour. Although CSE was enhanced during the observation of both goal-directed and social behaviour, there was no difference between the two.

We tested this putative relationship between the cerebellar vermis and nonsomatic functions by stimulating the cerebellum noninvasively via neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this randomized, counter-balanced, within-subject study, intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS) was applied on three different days to the vermis and the right and left cerebellar hemispheres of 12 right-handed normal subjects with the aim of modulating activity in the targeted cerebellar structure. TBS-associated changes were investigated via cardiovascular monitoring, a series of emotionally arousing picture stimuli, subjective analog scales for primal emotions, and the Profile of Mood States test. All 36 sessions of cerebellar stimulation were tolerated well without serious adverse events. Cardiovascular monitoring pointed to a mild but significant decrease in heart rate subsequent to vermal stimulation; no changes were detected in systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurements. Subjective ratings detected a significant increase in Thirst and a trend toward increased Appetite following vermal stimulation. These observations are consistent with existing neurophysiological and neuroimaging data indicating a role for the cerebellum in the regulation of visceral responses. In conjunction with the modulatory function of the cerebellum, our results suggest a role for the vermis in somatovisceral integration likely through cerebello-hypothalamic pathways.

Ten healthy subjects participated in a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of iTBS and nicotine. iTBS alone increased the rate of learning but this increase was blocked by nicotine. We then investigated factors other than synaptic strengthening that may play a role. Behavioral analysis and modeling suggested that iTBS increased performance variability, which correlated with learning outcome. A control experiment confirmed the increase in motor output variability by showing that iTBS increased the dispersion of involuntary transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked thumb movements.

Impaired regulation of cerebral excitability is thought to play a role in the occurrence of these paroxysms, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Normal ion channels are crucial for coordinating neuronal firing in response to facilitatory input. Thus, we hypothesized that channel dysfunction in episodic ataxia type 2 and familial hemiplegic migraine may impair the ability to adjust cerebral excitability after facilitatory events. We tested this hypothesis in patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (n = 6), patients with familial hemiplegic migraine (n = 7) and healthy controls (n = 13). All subjects received a high-frequency burst (10 pulses at 20 Hz) of transcranial magnetic stimulation to transiently increase the excitability of the motor cortex. Acute burst-induced excitability changes were probed at 50, 250, 500 and 1000 ms after the end of the burst. This was done using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess corticospinal excitability, and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation at an interstimulus interval of 2 and 10 ms to assess intracortical inhibition and facilitation, respectively. The time course of burst-induced excitability changes differed between groups. Healthy controls showed a short-lived increase in excitability that was only present 50 ms after the burst. In contrast, patients with episodic ataxia type 2 showed an abnormally prolonged increase in corticospinal excitability that was still present 250 ms after the transcranial magnetic stimulation burst. Furthermore, while controls showed a decrease in intracortical facilitation during the 1 s period following the transcranial magnetic stimulation burst, patients with episodic ataxia type 2 had increased intracortical facilitation 1000 ms after the burst. Intracortical inhibition was unaltered between groups. Patients with familial hemiplegic migraine were not significantly different from either controls or patients with episodic ataxia type 2. Together, these findings indicate that patients with episodic ataxia type 2 have an excessive increase in motor cortex excitability following a strong facilitatory input.

However, if any of these abnormalities alone is sufficient to cause focal dystonia (FD) remains unknown. Ten patients with cervical dystonia (CD), 9 with blepharospasm (BS) and 16 age- and sex-matched controls were examined. PAS was performed by combining repetitively electric stimulation of the median nerve with subsequent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex at 21.5ms (PAS21.5) and 10ms (PAS10). Corticospinal excitability was indexed by the magnitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. In controls, MEP size of the homotopically conditioned APB increased after PAS21.5 whereas the MEP size of the heterotopically conditioned ADM remained stable. PAS10 led to a decrease of MEP size of the APB and to an increase of the heterotopic ADM. In contrast, after PAS21.5 and PAS10 in CD and BS MEP size increased and decreased, respectively, in both muscles. The magnitude of excitability changes, however, did not differ between dystonic patients and healthy controls. In FD the topographic organization of PAS21.5 and PAS10-induced plasticity is deranged in cortical areas not involved in the control of the dystonic body part. Somatotopical disorganization of plasticity may represent an endophenotypic trait in FD but may not be sufficient to generate a dystonic phenotype.

Although the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a common TMS target for treating clinical depression as well as modulating pain, little is known about whether TMS over this area may affect perceived controllability. The present study explored the immediate effects of fast TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on the analgesic effects of perceived pain controllability. Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent a laboratory pain task designed to manipulate perception of pain controllability. Real TMS, compared with sham, suppressed the analgesic benefits of perceived control on the emotional dimension of pain, but not the sensory/discriminatory dimension. Findings suggest that, at least acutely, fast TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may interrupt the perceived-controllability effect on the emotional dimension of pain experience. Although it is not clear whether this cortical area is directly involved with modulating perceived controllability or whether downstream effects are responsible for the present findings, it appears possible that left dorsolateral prefrontal TMS may produce analgesic effects by acting through a cortical perceived-control circuit regulating limbic and brainstem areas of the pain circuit.

Electrophysiological research has provided evidence that gamma band activity (30-80 Hz) is a physiological indicator of the co-activation of cortical cells engaged in processing visual stimuli and integrating different features of a stimulus. A number of studies have found augmented and indiscriminative gamma band power at early stages of visual processing in ASD; this may be related to decreased inhibitory processing and an increase in the ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition. Low frequency or 'slow' (\u22641HZ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to increase inhibition of stimulated cortex by the activation of inhibitory circuits. METHODS: We wanted to test the hypothesis of gamma band abnormalities at early stages of visual processing in ASD by investigating relative evoked (i.e. ~ 100 ms) gamma power in 25 subjects with ASD and 20 age-matched controls using Kanizsa illusory figures. Additionally, we wanted to assess the effects of 12 sessions of bilateral 'slow' rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on evoked gamma activity using a randomized controlled design. RESULTS: In individuals with ASD evoked gamma activity was not discriminative of stimulus type, whereas in controls early gamma power differences between target and non-target stimuli were highly significant. Following rTMS individuals with ASD showed significant improvement in discriminatory gamma activity between relevant and irrelevant visual stimuli. We also found significant improvement in the responses on behavioral questionnaires (i.e., irritability, repetitive behavior) as a result of rTMS. CONCLUSION: We proposed that 'slow' rTMS may have increased cortical inhibitory tone which improved discriminatory gamma activity at early stages of visual processing. rTMS has the potential to become an important therapeutic tool in ASD treatment and has shown significant benefits in treating core symptoms of ASD with few, if any side effects.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Altered dopamine modulation of LTD-like plasticity in Alzheimer's disease patients.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17507644", "authors": ["Koch, G", "Esposito, Z", "Codec\u00e0, C", "Mori, F", "Kusayanagi, H", "Monteleone, F", "Di Lorenzo, F", "Bernardi, G", "Martorana, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Prospective clinical study.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "185", "title": "Do sleep complaints contribute to age-related cognitive decline?", "issue": "", "pmid": "17991698", "authors": ["Altena, E", "Ramautar, JR", "Van Der Werf, YD", "Van Someren, EJ"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate central motor conduction time (CMCT) values in patients with compressive thoracic myelopathy (CTM) and analyze its power to diagnose this condition.", "pages": "1166-8"}, {"volume": "174", "title": "Recovery of motor performance deterioration induced by a demanding finger motor task does not follow cortical excitability dynamics.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17899042", "authors": ["Avanzino, L", "Tacchino, A", "Abbruzzese, G", "Quartarone, A", "Ghilardi, MF", "Bonzano, L", "Ruggeri, P", "Bove, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "CTM is rare and its diagnosis is often difficult, when other spinal disorders such as cervical or lumbar degenerative spondylosis supervene.
