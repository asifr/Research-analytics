Recent progresses are permitting the design of better systems with higher accuracies, repeatability, and system robustness. Bidirectional interfaces integrate recording and the relaying of information from and to the brain for the development of BCIs. The concepts of non-invasive and invasive recording of brain activity are introduced. This includes classical and innovative techniques like electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy.

Implant power and the transmission of their data through implanted pulse generators and wireless telemetry are taken into account. How sensation can be relayed back to the brain to increase integration of the neuroengineered systems with the body by methods such as micro-stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are then addressed.

Recent findings have demonstrated that probabilistic information can override attentional effects, such as the cost of making an eye movement away from a visual target (antisaccade cost). The neural substrates of such probability effects have been associated with activity in the superior colliculus (SC). Given the immense reciprocal connections to SC, it is plausible that this modulation originates from higher oculomotor regions, such as the frontal eye field (FEF) and the supplementary eye field (SEF). To test this possibility, the present study employed theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to selectively interfere with FEF and SEF activity. We found that TMS disrupted the effect of location probability when TMS was applied over FEF. This was not observed in the SEF TMS condition. Together, these 2 experiments suggest that the FEF plays a critical role not only in initiating saccades but also in modulating the effects of location probability on saccade production.", "pages": "145"}, {"volume": "589", "title": "Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the underlying neural mechanisms of human motor learning and memory.", "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "16783559", "authors": ["Censor, N", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "In 19 healthy volunteers, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the excitability in pathways linking the left dorsal premotor cortex and right primary motor cortex and those linking the left and right motor cortex during the response delay and the reaction time period while subjects performed a delayed response [symbol 1 (S1) - symbol 2 (S2)] Go-NoGo reaction time task with visual cues.

S1 coded for right-hand or left-hand movement, and S2 for release or stopping the prepared movement. Conditioning of the left premotor cortex led to interhemispheric inhibition at 300 ms post-S1, interhemispheric facilitation at 150 ms post-S2, and shorter reaction times in the move-left condition. Conditioning of the left motor cortex led to inhibition at 1800 ms post-S1 and 150 ms post-S2, and slower reaction times for move-right conditions, and inhibition at 300 and 1800 ms post-S1 for move-left conditions. Relative motor evoked potential amplitudes following premotor conditioning at 150 ms post-S2 were significantly smaller in 'NoGo' than in 'Go' trials for move-left instructions.

If these pulses are applied in a repetitive fashion (rTMS), persistent modulation of neural excitability can be achieved. The technique has proved beneficial in the treatment of a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, the effect of rTMS on excitability and the other performance indicators shows a considerable degree of variability across different sessions and subjects. The frequency of stimulation has always been considered as the main determinant of the direction of excitability modulation. However, interactions exist between frequency and several other stimulation parameters that also influence the degree of modulation. In addition, the spatial interaction of the transient electric field induced by the TMS pulse with the cortical neurons is another contributor to variability. Consideration of all of these factors is necessary in order to improve the consistency of the conditioning effect and to better understand the outcomes of investigations with rTMS. These user-controlled sources of variability are discussed against the background of the mechanisms that are believed to drive the excitability changes. The mechanism behind synaptic plasticity is commonly accepted as the driver of sustained excitability modulation for rTMS and indeed, plasticity and rTMS share many characteristics, but definitive evidence is lacking for this. It is more likely that there is a multiplicity of mechanisms behind the action of rTMS. The different mechanisms interact with each other and this will contribute to the variability of rTMS-induced excitability changes. This review investigates the links between rTMS and synaptic plasticity, describes their similarities and differences, and highlights a neglected contribution of the membrane potential.

The aim of the paper is to provide a synthesis of the literature on psychomotor retardation in depression with the goal of enhanced awareness for clinicians and researchers. Increased knowledge and understanding of psychomotor retardation in major depressive disorder may lead to further research and better informed diagnosis in regards to psychomotor retardation. Manifestations of psychomotor retardation include slowed speech, decreased movement, and impaired cognitive function. It is common in patients with melancholic depression and those with psychotic features. Biological correlates may include abnormalities in the basal ganglia and dopaminergic pathways. Neurophysiologic tools such as neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation may play a role in the study of this symptom in the future. At present, there are three objective scales to evaluate psychomotor retardation severity. Studies examining the impact of psychomotor retardation on clinical outcome have found differential results. However, available evidence suggests that depressed patients with psychomotor retardation may respond well to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Here, we presented two verniers with opposite offset directions one after the other. A vernier consists of two vertical bars that are horizontally offset. When the two verniers are separated by a blank screen (interstimulus interval, ISI), the two verniers are perceived either as two separate entities or as one vernier with the offset moving from one side to the other depending on the ISI. In both cases, their offsets can be reported independently. Transcranial magnet stimulation (TMS) over the occipital cortex does not interfere with the offset discrimination of either vernier. When a grating, instead of the ISI, is presented, the two verniers are not perceived separately anymore, but as 'one' vernier with 'one' fused vernier offset. TMS strongly modulates the percept of the fused vernier offset even though the spatio-temporal position of the verniers is identical in the ISI and grating conditions. We suggest that the grating suppresses the termination signal of the first vernier and the onset signal of the second vernier. As a consequence, perception of the individual verniers is suppressed. Neural representations of the vernier and second vernier inhibit each other, which renders them vulnerable to TMS for at least 300 ms, even though stimulus presentation was only 100 ms.

According to all of them, a correct diagnosis of depression is required before starting therapy. Within recent years many different types of antidepressants have been introduced to the pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium. The \"newer\" antidepressants were developed with a view to reduced side effects. However, the classes of antidepressants currently available differ little in their antidepressant efficacy, thus, all producing treatment responses of 50 - 75 %. Therefore, the selection of a particular antidepressant for the individual patient depends on various factors: patient's prior experience with medication, concurrent medical conditions that may be worsened by selected antidepressants, concomitant use of non-psychiatric medications that may lead to negative drug-drug interactions, a drug's short and long-term side effects, physician's experience with the medication and patient's history of adherence to medication. Importantly, if the patient does not show any improvement after two to four weeks of treatment with an antidepressant dose at the upper level of the standard dose, it becomes less likely that he will respond to this particular medication later. When a partial or non-response is present, several therapeutic options are available: (1) combining two antidepressants from different classes, (2) switch to new antidepressant from a different or the same pharmacological class and (3) augmentation strategies. For patients who are reluctant to take traditional antidepressants, herbal remedies such as hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) provide an alternative for treatment of mild to moderate depression. Besides pharmacological treatment options non pharmacological biological interventions are available. Electroconvulsive therapy and partial sleep deprivation are very effective in the treatment of acute depression.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a safe non-invasive brain stimulation technique, enables the study of the functional role of specific cortical areas by evaluating the behavioural consequences of selective modulation of activity (excitation or inhibition) on memory generation and consolidation, contributing to the understanding of the neural substrates of motor learning. Depending on the parameters of stimulation, rTMS can also facilitate learning processes, presumably through purposeful modulation of excitability in specific brain regions. rTMS has also been used to gain valuable knowledge regarding the timeline of motor memory formation, from initial encoding to stabilization and long-term retention.

Inhibitory and excitatory TBS were applied to the left DLPFC, to the right DLPFC, or to an occipital cortical control site. A short-lasting interruption of the pathological language switching occurred after excitatory left DLPFC stimulation, while inhibitory left DLPFC TBS transiently increased the number of utterances produced in the unwanted second language.

Offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to test whether the left angular gyrus is involved in LRD and whether men have a stronger lateralization in LRD than women. Twenty-four participants (12 men, 12 women) completed a behavioral LRD task in three different conditions: after rTMS of the left and right angular gyrus and after 'sham' rTMS (control). The results revealed that after rTMS of the left angular gyrus, LRD accuracy rates were significantly reduced compared to the control condition. After rTMS of the right angular gyrus no difference to the control condition was observed. In addition, there was no overall sex difference in the LRD task and men and women were similarly affected by stimulation over the left and right angular gyrus, suggesting that the functional cerebral organization of LRD does not differ in men and women with similar LRD skills. Taken together, the findings suggest that the left angular gyrus is critically involved in LRD.

However, the cellular and network level effects of stimulation are still unclear and their study relies heavily on indirect physiological measurements in humans. Direct electrophysiological studies of the effect of magnetic stimulation on neuronal activity in behaving animals are severely limited by both the size of the stimulating coils, which affect large regions of the animal brain, and the large artifacts generated on the recording electrodes. We present a novel mini-coil which is specifically aimed at studying the neurophysiological mechanism of magnetic stimulation in behaving primates. The mini-coil fits into a chronic recording chamber and provides focal activation of brain areas while enabling simultaneous extracellular multi-electrode recordings. We present a comparison of this coil to a commercial coil based on the theoretical and recorded magnetic fields and induced electric fields they generate. Subsequently, we present the signal recorded in the behaving primate during stimulation and demonstrate the ability to extract the spike trains of multiple single units from each of the electrodes with minimal periods affected by the stimulus artifact (median period <2.5 ms). The directly recorded effect of the magnetic stimulation on cortical neurons is in line with peripheral recordings obtained in humans.
