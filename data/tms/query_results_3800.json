We studied AG, ANT reaction time (RT), and RT differences in both motor activation (MA) and motor cancellation (MC) tasks, in response to an auditory stimulus.

No effect was apparent during sham stimulation, MA tasks, left upper limb recording, and other coil orientations. While the high correlation between AG and ANT RT suggests a close relationship in both MA and MC, significant DIFF changes point to an alteration of this relationship by TMS during MC. Although TMS resulted in significantly increased DIFF during MC tasks, this was not due to delayed ANT RT. This suggests that the short ANT burst observed invariably during MC may not be a cerebellum-generated response, but is derived from the cortical or subcortical level.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potent tool for modifying neural activity at the stimulated area and at a distance along functional anatomical connections. Depending on stimulation parameters, cortical networks can be functionally disturbed or modulated in their activity. The technique can alleviate tinnitus by modulating the excitability of neurons in the auditory cortex. It is assumed that TMS decreases the hyperexcitability that is associated with some forms of tinnitus. A growing number of studies demonstrate reduction of tinnitus after repeated sessions of low-frequency rTMS and indicate that rTMS might represent a new promising approach for the treatment of tinnitus. Single sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the temporal cortex have been successful in reducing the intensity of tinnitus during the time of stimulation and could be predictive for treatment outcome of chronic epidural stimulation using implanted electrodes. Because most available studies have been performed with small sample sizes and show only moderate effect sizes and high interindividual variability of treatment effects, further development of the technique is needed before it can be recommended for use in clinical routine.

To address this issue, we mapped, for both hands, the representation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (1DI) in 12 CH patients by using transcranial magnetic stimulation co-registered onto individual three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging; these maps were compared with those gathered in age-matched controls (n = 11).

Here, we compared clinical and neurophysiological effects of STN stimulation with those of 1 Hz rTMS given to the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and those following intake of levodopa in a group of PD patients with advanced disease. Ten PD patients were studied on 2 consecutive days before and after surgery. Clinical effects were determined using the UPDRS motor score.

Levodopa significantly improved clinical symptoms and increased the SP duration. STN stimulation improved clinical symptoms without changing the SP duration.

This approach offers a method to test the contribution of cortical neurons actively involved in a motor task, but requires a large number of stimuli (approximately 100) to suitably depress the average EMG. Here, we investigated whether two pulses of subthreshold TMS at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging between 1 and 12 ms could enhance the amount of EMG suppression in the tibialis anterior muscle compared to a single pulse. Pairs of subthreshold TMS at an ISI of 7 ms produced the maximum EMG suppression that was 42% more than the inhibition elicited using a single pulse. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of the TMS-induced suppression was further increased by a second pulse, delivered 7 ms later. The reduction in the EMG at the 7 ms paired-pulse interval occurred without any short-latency excitation suggesting that the two stimuli increased the activation of cortical inhibitory neurons. Subthreshold paired-pulse TMS at ISIs of 1-3 ms was prone to EMG excitation in the period that immediately preceded the inhibition and is consistent with the recruitment of short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF). We propose that pairs of subthreshold TMS outside the range of SICF with an inter-pulse interval of 7 ms is optimal to inhibit ongoing cortical activity during human motor movement.", "pages": "215-9"}, {"volume": "2008", "title": "Modeling transcranial DC stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "195211", "authors": ["Mustaffa, I", "Trenado, C", "Schwerdtfeger, K", "Strauss, DJ"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Depending on the polarity of the stimulation, tDCS can increase (anodal tDCS) or decrease (cathodal tDCS) cortical excitability in the stimulated brain regions and thereby enable the investigation of the causal relationships between brain activity and behavior. Recently, tDCS has been increasingly used to investigate human cognitive and motor functions in both healthy volunteers and neurological patients. Although tDCS generally produces diffuse cortical stimulation over a period of time, it has several advantages over other brain-stimulation tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). First, since tDCS produces less artifacts such as acoustic noise and muscle twitching, it is more suitable for double-blind, sham-controlled studies and clinical applications. Second, tDCS is not very expensive and can be performed with compact equipment, it can be easily combined with ongoing projects in neuroscience and psychology laboratories. Third, the facilitation of motor and cognitive functions by anodal tDCS may have great potential for cognitive and motor enhancement, for example, to support learning in healthy volunteers and to expedite the rehabilitation process in neurological patients.

The aim of present paper was to investigate the central nervous system level at which PAS produces its effects. We recorded corticospinal descending volleys evoked by single pulse TMS of the motor cortex before and after PAS in 4 conscious subjects who had an electrode implanted in the cervical epidural space for the control of pain. The descending volleys evoked by TMS represent postsynaptic activity of corticospinal neurones that can provide indirect information about the effectiveness of synaptic inputs to these neurones.

In the posterior parietal cortex, it has been suggested that the superior parietal lobule (SPL) underlies VI, whereas MI relies on the supramarginalis gyrus (SMG). However, because several brain imaging studies have also shown an overlap of activations in SPL and SMG during VI or MI, the question arises as to which extent these 2 subregions really contribute to distinct imagery processes. To address this issue, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce virtual lesions of either SMG or SPL in subjects performing a MI (hand drawing rotation) or a VI (letter rotation) task. Whatever hemisphere was stimulated, SMG lesions selectively altered MI, whereas SPL lesions only affected VI, demonstrating a double dissociation between MI and VI. Because these deficits were not influenced by the angular distance of the stimuli, we suggest that SMG and SPL are involved in the reenactment of the motor and visual representations, respectively, and not in mental rotation processes per se.", "pages": "215-9"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the cerebellum and implicit processing of happy facial expressions.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19210053", "authors": ["Kapogiannis, D", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN", "abstract": "According to Milner and Goodale's theory of the two visual streams, the dorsal (action) stream controls actions in real-time, whereas the ventral (perceptual) stream stores longer-term information for object identification. By this account, the dorsal stream subserves actions carried out immediately. However, when a delay is required before the response, the ventral (perceptual) stream is recruited. Indeed, a neuroimaging study from our lab has found reactivation of an area within the ventral stream, the lateral occipital (LO) cortex, at the time of action even when no visual stimulus was present. To tease apart the contribution of specific areas within the dorsal and ventral streams to the online control of grasping under immediate and delayed conditions, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and to LO. We show that while TMS to aIPS affected grasp under both immediate and delayed conditions, TMS to LO influenced grasp only under delayed movement conditions. The effects of TMS were restricted to early movement kinematics (i.e. within 300 ms) due to the transient nature of TMS, which was always delivered simultaneous with movement onset.

TMS-related behavioural effects are often interpreted as reflecting selective disruption of processing primarily within the stimulated region itself. This approach is now being extended by studies that combine TMS with concurrent neuroimaging measures, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We discuss some recent combined TMS-fMRI studies and their implications for TMS investigations of cognition and perception. An emerging theme is that TMS does not affect only the stimulated region, but can also influence remote brain areas interconnected with the stimulation site. Such 'network' effects of TMS can be anatomically specific, but also context-dependent, changing with the current functional state of the targeted network rather than simply reflecting just fixed, context-invariant anatomical connectivity. Perceptual and behavioural effects of TMS may correspondingly involve TMS influences on remote interconnected brain regions, not solely on the stimulated region itself. Thus, TMS can now be used to study the consequences of functional interactions between the stimulated region and other parts of the network. This may lead beyond strictly modular views of brain function, that emphasize functional properties of single brain areas, towards new perspectives on how functional interactions between remote but interconnected brain regions may support perception and cognition.", "pages": "215-9"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation in sleep medicine.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8741977", "authors": ["Doeltgen, SH", "Ridding, MC", "O'Beirne, GA", "Dalrymple-Alford, J", "Huckabee, ML"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Sleep medicine reviews", "abstract": "Focal hand dystonia (FHD) is a rare but potentially devastating disorder involving involuntary muscle spasms and abnormal posturing that impairs functional hand use.
