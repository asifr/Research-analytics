Nevertheless, during opening and closing of the affected hand, functional magnetic resonance imaging showed an activation of the lesioned primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), as well as of the intact SMA and the parietal areas, but not of the ipsilateral motor areas.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is simple, non-invasive, and widely used in neurophysiology. Therapeutic results in a few studies are equivocal at best. Deep brain stimulation, although experimental, has been applied to the cerebellum, caudate nucleus, centromedian thalamus, anterior thalamus, subthalamus, hippocampus, and neocortical seizure foci. Preliminary results are encouraging, but not conclusive. Electrode implantation in the brain for indications other than seizures has been associated with a 5% risk for intracranial haemorrhage and 5% for infection. A controlled study of anterior thalamic stimulation in patients with intractable partial and secondarily generalised seizures has been started.

To assess excitability changes, we applied a paired-pulse protocol consisting of paired electrical stimulation of the median nerve using an interstimulus interval of 30 ms and recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials. For ipsilateral SI we found that 1 h after termination of 5 Hz rTMS applied over the left SI with a figure-of-eight coil there was a sustained suppression of the normally present paired-pulse inhibition.

Treatments for other conditions are still in experimental stages and large-scale, well controlled studies are needed to refine the treatment procedures. In the treatment of intractable brain disorders, brain stimulation, especially transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is an attractive alternative to surgical lesioning as it is relatively safe, reversible, and flexible. Brain stimulation, delivered either via deeply implanted electrodes or from a surface-mounted transcranial magnetic device, can alter abnormal neural circuits underlying brain disorders. The neural mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of brain stimulation, however, are poorly understood. Conflicting theories and experimental data have been presented. It seems that the action of stimulation on brain circuitry is not limited to simple excitation or inhibition. Alterations of neural firing patterns and long-term effects on neurotransmitter and receptor systems may also play important roles in the therapeutic effects of brain stimulation. Future research on both the basic and clinical fronts will deepen our understanding of how brain stimulation works.

For example, although several aspects of visual imagery and mental rotation have been reconstructed through mental chronometry, their instantaneous evolution has never been directly observed. We paired mental chronometry to eye movement recording in subjects performing a visuospatial mental rotation task and an instructed circular motion imagery task. In both tasks, sequences of spontaneous saccades formed curved trajectories with a regular spatio-temporal evolution. In the visuospatial mental rotation task, saccadic amplitude decreased progressively within each sequence, resulting in an average gaze rotation with a bell-shaped asymmetrical angular velocity profile whose peak and mean increased with the amount of the to-be-performed rotation, as in reaching movements. In the second task, the average gaze rotation reproduced faithfully the to-be-imagined constant-velocity circular motion, thus excluding important distortions in the oculomotor performance.

We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) both as a reliable tool for quantifying the CS excitability, through the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and as a central perturbation evoking a movement (because the stimulation intensity was above threshold) with subjects instructed to prepare (without changing their muscle activation) either to \"let go\" or to \"resist\" to this evoked movement.

To their great surprise, subjects were found able to cognitively prepare themselves to resist a TMS-induced central perturbation; they all reported an important cognitive effort on the evoked movement. Moreover, because TMS only evoked short-latency MEPs (and no long-latency components), the amplitude of these short-latency MEPs was found to be related in a continuous way to the actual movement whatever the prior intention. These results demonstrate that prior intention allows an anticipatory modulation of the CS excitability, which is not only selective (as already known) but also efficient, giving the intended motor behavior a real chance to be realized.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used routinely in neuropsychiatric conditions and as an atraumatic method to activate descending motor pathways.

We have applied daily 10 Hz rTMS for 8 weeks immediately after an incomplete high (T4-5; n = 5) or low (T10-11; n = 6) thoracic closed spinal cord compression-injury in adult rats, using 6 high- and 6 low-lesioned non-stimulated animals as controls.

In the control group, the BBB score was significantly better from the 7th week post-injury in animals lesioned at T4-5 compared to those lesioned at T10-11. rTMS significantly improved locomotor recovery in T10-11-injured rats, but not in rats with a high thoracic injury. In rTMS-treated rats, there was significant positive correlation between final BBB score and grey matter density of serotonergic fibres in the spinal segment just caudal to the lesion. We propose that low thoracic lesions produce a greater functional deficit because they interfere with the locomotor centre and that rTMS is beneficial in such lesions because it activates this central pattern generator, presumably via descending serotonin pathways.

THE TECHNOLOGY: rTMS is a noninvasive way to stimulate nerve cells in areas of the brain. During rTMS, an electrical current passes through a wire coil placed over the scalp. The current induces a magnetic field that produces an electrical field in the brain that then causes nerve cells to depolarize, resulting in the stimulation or disruption of brain activity. Researchers have investigated rTMS as an option to treat MDD, as an add-on to drug therapy, and, in particular, as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The advantages of rTMS over ECT for patients with severe refractory depression are that general anesthesia is not needed, it is an outpatient procedure, it requires less energy, the simulation is specific and targeted, and convulsion is not required. The advantages of rTMS as an add-on treatment to drug therapy may include hastening of the clinical response when used with antidepressant drugs.

There were, however, several crucial methodological limitations in the included studies that were not critically assessed. These are discussed below. Recent meta-analyses (including 2 international health technology assessments) have done evidence-based critical analyses of studies that have assessed rTMS for MDD. The 2 most recent health technology assessments (from the Oxford Cochrane Collaboration and the Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment) concluded that there is no evidence that rTMS is effective for the treatment of MDD, either as compared with a placebo for patients with treatment-resistant or nontreatment-resistant MDD, or as an alternative to ECT for patients with treatment-resistant MDD. This mainly due to the poor quality of the studies. The major methodological limitations were identified in older meta-analyses, recent health technology assessments, and the most recently published trials (Level 2-4 evidence) on the effectiveness of rTMS for MDD are discussed below. Small sample size was a limitation acknowledged by many of the authors. There was also a lack of a priori sample size calculation or justification. Biased randomization may have been a problem. Generally, the published reports lacked detailed information on the method of allocation concealment used. This is important because it is impossible to determine if there was a possible influence (direct or indirect) in the allocation of the patients to different treatment groups. The trials were single blind, evaluated by external blinded assessors, rather than double blind. Double blinding is more robust, because neither the participants nor the investigators know which participants are receiving the active treatment and which are getting a placebo. Those administering rTMS, however, cannot be blinded to whether they are administering the active treatment or a placebo. There was patient variability among the studies. In some studies, the authors said that patients were \"medication resistant,\" but the definitions of resistant, if provided, were inconsistent or unclear. For example, some described \"medication resistant\" as failing at least one trial of drugs during the current depressive episode. Furthermore, it was unclear if the term \"medication resistant\" referred to antidepressants only or to combinations of antidepressants and other drug augmentation strategies (such as neuroleptics, benzodiazepine, carbamazepine, and lithium). Also variable was the type of depression (i.e., unipolar and/or bipolar), if patients were inpatients or outpatients, if they had psychotic symptoms or no psychotic symptoms, and the chronicity of depression. Dropouts or withdrawals were a concern. Some studies reported that patients dropped out, but provided no further details. Intent-to-treat analysis was not done in any of the trials. This is important, because ignoring patients who drop out of a trial can bias the results, usually in favour of the treatment. This is because patients who withdraw from trials are less likely to have had the treatment, more likely to have missed their interim checkups, and more likely to have experienced adverse effects when taking the treatment, compared with patients who do not withdraw. (1) Measurement of treatment outcomes using scales or inventories makes interpreting results and drawing conclusions difficult. The most common scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is based on a semistructured interview. Some authors (2) reported that rating scales based on semistructured interviews are more susceptible to observation bias than are self-administered questionnaires such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Martin et al. (3) argued that the lack of consistency in effect as determined by the 2 scales (a positive result after 2 weeks of treatment as measured by the HDRS and a negative result for the BDI) makes definitive conclusions about the nature of the change in mood of patients impossible. It was suggested that because of difficulties interpreting results from psychometric scales, (4) and the subjective or unstable character of MDD, other, more objective, outcome measures such as readmission to hospital, time to hospital discharge, time to adjunctive treatment, and time off work should be used to assess rTMS for the treatment of depression. A placebo effect could have influenced the results. Many studies reported response rates for patients who received placebo treatment. For example, Klein et al. (5) reported a control group response rate as high as 25%. Patients receiving placebo rTMS may receive a small dose of magnetic energy that may alter their depression. Short-term studies were the most common. Patients received rTMS treatment for 1 to 2 weeks. Most studies followed-up patients for 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment. Dannon et al. (6) followed-up patients who responded to a course of ECT or rTMS for up to 6 months; however, the assessment procedure was not blinded, the medication regimen during follow-up was not controlled, and initial baseline data for the patient groups were not reported. The long-term effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of depression is unknown, as is the long-term use, if any, of maintenance therapy. The cost-effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of depression is also unknown. A lack of long-term studies makes cost-effectiveness analysis difficult. The complexity of possible combinations for administering rTMS makes comparing like with like difficult. Wasserman and Lisanby (7) have said that the method for precisely targeting the stimulation in this area is unreliable. It is unknown if the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is the optimal location for treatment. Further, differences in rTMS administration include number of trains per session, duration of each train, and motor threshold. Clinical versus statistical significance. Several meta-analyses and studies have found that the degree of therapeutic change associated with rTMS across studies is relatively modest; that is, results may be statistically, but not necessarily clinically, significant. (8-11). Conventionally, a 50% reduction in the HDRS scores is commonly accepted as a clinically important reduction in depression. Although some studies have observed a statistically significant reduction in the depression rating, many have not shows the clinically significant reduction of 50% on the HDRS. (11-13) Therefore, few patients in these studies would meet the standard criteria for response. (9) Clinical/methodological diversity and statistical heterogeneity. In the Norwegian health technology assessment, Aarre et al. (14) said that a formal meta-analysis was not feasible because the designs of the studies varied too much, particularly in how rTMS was administered and in the characteristics of the patients. They noted that the quality of the study designs was poor. The 12 studies that comprised the assessment had small samples, and highly variable inclusion criteria and study designs. The patients' previous histories, diagnoses, treatment histories, and treatment settings were often insufficiently characterized. Furthermore, many studies reported that patients had treatment-resistant MDD, yet did not listclear criteria for the designation. Without this information, Aarre and colleagues suggested that the interpretation of the results is difficult and the generalizability of results is questionable. They concluded that rTMS cannot be recommended as a standard treatment for depression: \"More, larger and more carefully designed studies are needed to demonstrate convincingly a clinically relevant effect of rTMS.\" In the Cochrane Collaboration systematic review, Martin et al. (3;15) said that the complexity of possible combinations for administering rTMS makes comparison of like versus like difficult. A statistical test for heterogeneity (chi-square test) examines if the observed treatment effects are more different from each other than one would expect due to random error (or chance) alone. (16) However, this statistical test must be interpreted with caution because it has low power in the (common) situation of a meta-analysis when the trials have small sample sizes or are few.

During TMS we recorded relative current variations under different stimulating coil orientations and at different points in the subject's brain.

Responses to TMS were recorded in the flexor and extensor carpi radialis muscles (FCR, ECR) after conditioning with a rapid wrist extension movement. The cortical stimuli were timed to elicit a motor-evoked potential (MEP) at either the SLSR or LLSR onset in the FCR muscle. Responses were also collected in TMS-alone and stretch reflex-alone conditions. Six intensities of magnetic stimulation were applied in all conditions. In the FCR muscle, MEP amplitude when timed to arrive at the LLSR onset was significantly greater than the sum of the MEP and stretch reflex responses when given separately. MEP amplitudes at the SLSR onset in the FCR muscle and in the ECR muscle at both SLSR and LLSR onset were not significantly different from that expected from the sum of the two stimuli given separately. This indicates heightened corticospinal excitability at a time corresponding to the passage of an afferent volley induced by the stretch, and raises the possibility of a transcortical loop of the LLSR in the forearm. The extent of MEP facilitation was generally consistent across all stimulus intensities tested. A reduced component of the LLSR was evident when the stretch response was timed to arrive during the silent period following the cortical stimulus, suggesting both cortical and sub-cortical components to the reflex response.", "pages": "49-53"}, {"volume": "114", "title": "Modeling the effects of electrical conductivity of the head on the induced electric field in the brain during magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "12894029", "authors": ["Davey, K", "Epstein, CM", "George, MS", "Bohning, DE"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Kinesthetic motor imagery and actual execution of movements share a common neural circuitry.

Premotor, posterior parietal and cerebellar regions were significantly more active during motor imagery of complex movements than during mental rehearsal of the simple task. In 10 of the subjects, we also used transcranial magnetic brain stimulation to examine corticospinal excitability during the same motor imagery tasks. Motor-evoked potentials increased significantly over values obtained in a reference condition (visual imagery) during imagery of the complex, but not of the simple movement. Imagery of finger movements of either hand activated left dorsal and ventral premotor areas and the supplementary motor cortex regardless of task complexity.

We used transcranial magnetic stimulation-based techniques to study the time course of drug action in two antipsychotic drug-naive patients with schizophrenia; one patient treated with a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) and the other with an atypical antipsychotic (risperidone). The typical antipsychotic was associated with an increase in corticospinal excitability which we found to occur 4-5 weeks after beginning medication. In contrast, the atypical antipsychotic was associated with a decrease in corticospinal excitability, occurring 3-4 weeks after starting pharmacotherapy.

Ten healthy, right-handed subjects performed a four-choice RT task that involved flexion and extension of dominant wrist. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was presented at random intervals over a period of 120 ms prior to the subject's average non-stimulated voluntary electromyography (EMG) activity onset. We found that there was a significant relationship between motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and TMS onset when both the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) acted as an agonist. This relationship could be explained using the sigmoidal Boltzmann equation. The slope for the relationship did not differ between the Full and Direction conditions, suggesting that corticospinal excitability is not altered in the specification of movement extent. Both these conditions differed significantly from the None condition. The modulation of corticospinal excitability appeared greater in the FCR than in the ECR. There was a significant delay in RT the closer in time TMS was presented with respect to EMG onset. During extension, there was no difference in slope between the three conditions, whereas during flexion the slope was greater in the None condition than in the Direction condition, which was in turn greater than in the Full condition. This was mirrored in the relationship between agonist MEP amplitude and TMS onset for both muscles. It is possible that the gain of the corticospinal tract is increased in the conditions in which less information is provided in the precue to partly compensate for the increase in RT, which comes as a result of the additional processing required in those conditions.", "pages": "49-53"}, {"volume": "250 Suppl 3", "title": "Does transcranial magnetic stimulation improve the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease?", "issue": "", "pmid": "2087539", "authors": ["Tsuji, S", "Akamatsu, N"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "We investigated modulation of inhibition of motor evoked potentials in the left forearm musculature attributable to changes in corticomotor excitability induced by passive rhythmic movement of the right limb. In the first experiment, eight healthy volunteers pre-activated their left flexor carpi radialis (FCR) in a simple isometric contraction (2.5-7.5% MVC) while their right hand underwent passive wrist flexion-extension. Transcranial magnetic (TMS) or electrical (TES) stimulation was applied to the right motor cortex and responses recorded from the test (left) limb in eight phases of the wrist flexion-extension cycle of the passively driven right limb. In half of the trials TMS conditioning was applied to the left motor cortex. The conditioning stimulus significantly inhibited TMS-evoked responses in the test FCR muscle, whereas TES-evoked responses did not appear to be inhibited. For TMS-evoked responses only, inhibition in the static pre-activated left FCR was modulated such that inhibition was greater when the right wrist was passively flexing than when it was extending. In the second experiment TMS was applied to the right motor cortex, contralateral to the test (left) limb, with the right hand either passively extending or flexing through the neutral position. Conditioning was applied to the left motor cortex at a range of intensities adjusted to threshold for flexion and extension movements. No difference was evident in the maximum magnitude of inhibition between the extension and flexion conditions. We propose there is an increased absolute threshold for recruitment and a decreased gain of inhibitory callosal pathways during extension phases of the wrist flexion-extension cycle.", "pages": "49-53"}]
