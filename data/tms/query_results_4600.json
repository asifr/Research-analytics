However, the use of newer antidepressant drugs might be accompanied with some problems such as activation syndrome, serotonin syndrome, withdrawal syndrome, and suicidal-like behaviors. Secondly, it is important to predict whether the response to antidepressant drugs will shorten the treatment period. The polymorphisms of 5-HTTLPR and plasma MHPG levels might predict the response to SSRIs and SNRIs.

The central motor conduction time (CMCT) is a sensitive method to detect myelopathy and abnormalities may be detected in the absence of radiological changes. CMCT may also detect upper motor neuron involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The diagnostic sensitivity may be increased by using the triple stimulation technique (TST), by combining several parameters such as CMCT, motor threshold and silent period, or by studying multiple muscles. In peripheral facial nerve palsies, TMS may be used to localize the site of nerve dysfunction and clarify the etiology. TMS measures also have high sensitivity in detecting lesions in multiple sclerosis and abnormalities in CMCT or TST may correlate with motor impairment and disability. Cerebellar stimulation may detect lesions in the cerebellum or the cerebellar output pathway. TMS may detect upper motor neuron involvement in patients with atypical parkinsonism and equivocal signs. The ipsilateral silent period that measures transcallosal inhibition is a potential method to distinguish between different parkinsonian syndromes. Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which is related to central cholinergic transmission, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease. Changes in SAI following administration of cholinesterase inhibitor may be related to the long-term efficacy of this treatment. The results of MEP measurement in the first week after stroke correlate with functional outcome.

The results suggest that chronic nicotine intake may not only strengthen cholinergic inhibitory circuits, but could also be associated with enhanced inhibitory and reduced facilitatory mechanism of specific neuronal circuits in motor cortex.

Here, we investigated the nature and chronometry of that processing through a temporally specific disruption of M1 activity using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We applied single-pulse TMS to M1 or dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during adaptation of rapid arm movements (approximately 150 ms duration) to a visuomotor rotation. When M1 was stimulated either immediately after the end of each trial or with a 700 ms delay, subjects exhibited normal adaptation. However, whereas the memory of the subjects who received delayed-TMS showed normal rates of forgetting during deadaptation, the memory of those who received immediate TMS was more fragile: in the deadaptation period, they showed a faster rate of forgetting. Stimulation of PMd with adjusted (reduced) intensity to rule out the possibility of coactivation of this structure caused by the current spread from M1 stimulation did not affect adaptation or retention. The data suggest that, during the short time window after detection of movement errors, neural processing in M1 plays a crucial role in formation of motor memories.

It uses a magnetic field to stimulate the brain, modifying ongoing activity in neural tissue under the stimulating coil, producing an effect that has been likened to a \"virtual lesion.\" However, research into the functional basis of this effect, essential for the interpretation of findings, lags behind its application. Acutely, TMS may disable neuronal function, thereby interrupting ongoing neural processes. Alternatively, the effects of TMS have been attributed to an injection of \"neural noise,\" consistent with its immediate and effectively random depolarization of neurons. Here we apply an added-noise paradigm to test these alternatives. We delivered TMS to the visual cortex and measured its effect on a simple visual discrimination task, while concurrently manipulating the level of image noise in the visual stimulus itself. TMS increased thresholds overall; and increasing the amount of image noise systematically increased discrimination thresholds. However, these two effects were not independent. Rather, TMS interacted multiplicatively with the image noise, consistent with a reduction in the strength of the visual signal. Indeed, in this paradigm, there was no evidence that TMS independently added noise to the visual process.

In an earlier study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), we showed that stimulation to the left anterior midfrontal gyrus disrupted verb production, but not noun production, in a task that required subjects to perform simple morphological alternations. This result raises a number of questions: for example, is the effect of stimulation focal and specific to that brain region? Is the behavioral effect limited to rule-based, regular transformations, or can it be generalized over the grammatical category? In the present study, we used rTMS to suppress the excitability of distinct parts of the left prefrontal cortex to assess their role in producing regular and irregular verbs compared to nouns. We compared rTMS to sham stimulation and to stimulation of homologous areas in the right hemisphere. Response latencies increased for verbs, but were unaffected for nouns, following stimulation to the left anterior midfrontal gyrus. No significant interference specific for verbs resulted after stimulation to two other areas in the left frontal lobe, the posterior midfrontal gyrus and Broca's area. These results therefore reinforce the idea that the left anterior midfrontal cortex is critical for processing verbs.

This study assessed corticospinal motor responses during worry using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Participants received TMS during a worry induction, during motor imagery, and during mental arithmetic, while electromyography and force were measured. TMS over the primary motor cortex elicited larger corticospinal motor responses during worry than mental arithmetic and smaller responses than motor imagery of maximum voluntary contraction of targeted muscles.

The results showed that although the coactivation ratio did not change at task failure, the MVC torque produced by the elbow flexors declined by 48% (P < 0.01) with no change in MVC torque for the elbow extensors. While the MEP and CMEP areas (normalized to Mmax) of the biceps brachii increased ( approximately 50%) over the first 40% of the time to task failure and then plateaued, both responses in the triceps brachii increased ( approximately 150-180%) gradually throughout the fatigue task. In contrast to the monotonic increase in the MEP and CMEP of the antagonist muscles, the H-reflex of the triceps brachii exhibited a biphasic modulation, increasing during the first part of the contraction before declining subsequently to 65% of its initial value.

Ten patients with pre- or perinatally acquired, unilateral cortico-subcortical infarctions in the middle cerebral artery territory were studied with single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure motor threshold (MT) and with paired pulse TMS to study short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF).

No such differences were found for ICF. Findings in patients with congenital stroke were comparable with adulthood stroke.

It has been hypothesized, but not tested, that this phenomenon is mediated transcallosaly.

Thirty healthy individuals (aged 19-78 years) were studied using a paired-pulse protocol at rest and during a low-strength isometric contraction with the right hand. The IHI targeting the right motor cortex was assessed at two intervals, 10 ms (IHI10) and 40 ms (IHI40). The corticospinal excitability of the left hemisphere was assessed by means of input-output curves constructed during voluntary construction. Age was not correlated with IHI10 or IHI40 at rest. During muscle contraction IHI tended to increase at both intervals. However, this increase in IHI during the active condition (changeIHI) was less evident with advancing age for the 40 ms interval (r = 0.444, P = 0.02); in fact a degree of disinhibition was often present. There was no correlation between age and changeIHI10.
