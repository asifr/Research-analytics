It has been shown that 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) reduces excitability of visual cortex in normal subjects. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS on visual cortical excitability by measuring changes in phosphene threshold (PT) in subjects with migraine with aura. Thirteen patients with migraine with aura and 15 healthy controls were examined. Using a standardized transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol of the occipital cortex, we assessed the PT (the lowest magnetic stimulation intensity at which subjects just perceived phosphenes) before and after a 1-Hz rTMS train delivered at PT intensity for 15 min. The difference in the proportion of subjects reporting phosphenes in migrainer and control groups was significant (migrainers: 100% vs controls 47%; P<0.05), and 1 Hz rTMS over the occipital cortex led to a significantly increased visual cortex excitability expressed as a decrease in PT in subjects affected by migraine with aura. Conversely, after a 1-Hz TMS train normal subjects showed increased PT values, which suggests a decreased visual cortex excitability. Our findings confirm that the visual cortex is hyperexcitable in migrainers and suggest a failure of inhibitory circuits, which are unable to be upregulated by low frequency rTMS.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Bulimia in children and adolescents.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12109320", "authors": ["Brewerton, TD"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America", "abstract": "Although there have been many recent advances in research, much work remains to be done in the area of child and adolescent eating disorders.

Investigations were conducted to determine the level of the neuroaxis at which these modulations arise, and to establish the influence of proprioceptive task constraints on pathway excitability. Forearm motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were examined during passive wrist movement while subjects maintained a low-level muscle activation, thus stabilising the excitability of the motoneuron pool. Modulations in response amplitude during movement were evident in both forearm flexor and extensor muscles. The pattern of modulation generally mirrored that seen in quiescent musculature during movement, with responses potentiated during the phases where the muscle was in a shortened position. Variations in MEP amplitude were not detected while the wrist was constrained statically at various joint angles. This suggests a dynamic influence of movement, most likely mediated by spindle receptors, arising at a supraspinal level. We also investigated the influence of a kinesthetic tracking task on corticomotor excitability during passive movement of the wrist joint. MEPs were recorded from the target driven limb while the contralateral limb was stationary, while the contralateral limb actively tracked the movements of the target limb, and while the contralateral limb moved actively in time with a metronome. The results revealed no differences in MEP characteristics in the driven limb between the three conditions.

Formation, maintenance, and modification of these representations is an activity-driven process. Repeated stimulation of one representation results in increased motor output from this representation, a process referred to as \"within-representation plasticity.\" We showed previously that within-representation plasticity of the upper arm representation occurs when repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is delivered to that representation during transient ischemic nerve block (INB) of the contralateral hand. INB reduces inhibition in the motor cortex and thus lowers the threshold for stimulation-induced plasticity. Here we studied the effects of rTMS delivered to nearby body part representations on the motor output from the upper arm representation. Six healthy subjects underwent INB-alone (control), or INB plus 30 min of focal 0.1 Hz rTMS of either the face, hand, arm, leg, or overlap arm/hand representations in motor cortex. INB-alone and rTMS of the leg representation resulted in only a short-lasting (< 20 min) increase in motor output from the arm representation, as measured by motor evoked potentials in the biceps. rTMS of arm and arm/hand representations induced a prolonged (> 60 min) within-representation increase. In contrast, rTMS of face or hand representations canceled the short-lasting increase and even led to a long-lasting decrease of motor output from the arm representation. Therefore, rTMS of the experimentally disinhibited motor cortex induces within-representation increase, and across-representation decrease of motor cortical output. This bidirectional plasticity might be used for purposeful modulation of human cortical function.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Intensity-dependent effects of 1 Hz rTMS on human corticospinal excitability.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "12088713", "authors": ["Fitzgerald, PB", "Brown, TL", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "Chen, R", "Kulkarni, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To investigate the effect of volitional inhibition on cortical inhibitory mechanisms, we performed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies with a Go/NoGo reaction task in seven healthy subjects.

Reports of poorly defined, or a complete lack of systematic excitatory responses of soleus motoneurons compared with those of tibialis anterior (TA) motoneurons has led to the proposal that while all ankle flexor motoneurons receive strong corticomotoneuronal connections, very few soleus motoneurons do. In addition, the connections to these few motoneurons are weak. The nature of corticomotoneuronal connections onto these two motoneuron pools was re-evaluated in the following experiments. The leg area of the left motor cortex was stimulated with a large double-cone coil using Magstim 200, while surface electromyographic (EMG) and single motor unit (SMU) responses were recorded from soleus and TA muscles of healthy adult subjects. Under resting conditions, the onset (25-30 ms) and duration of concomitantly recorded short latency motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in surface EMG from both muscles were similar. The input-output relationships of the simultaneously recorded soleus and TA EMG responses showed much greater increases in TA MEPs compared with soleus MEPs with identical increases in stimulus intensity. Under resting and nonisometric conditions, a later peak with onset latency of approximately 100 ms was observed in soleus. During isometric conditions or with vibration of the TA tendon, the second soleus peak was abolished indicating reflex origin of this peak. Recordings from 42 soleus and 39 TA motor units showed clear response peaks in the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of every unit. Two statistical tests were done to determine the onset and duration of response peaks in the PSTHs. With chi(2) test, the duration was 6.9 +/- 4.2 ms (mean +/- SD) for soleus and 5.1 +/- 2.1 ms for TA. Using the criterion of discerning a peak by bin counts being three SDs above background, the duration was 10.0 +/- 4.4 ms for soleus and 7.8 +/- 2.6 ms for TA. Results of these experiments do not suggest a lack of systematic corticomotoneuronal connections on soleus motoneurons when compared with those on TA, though some differences in the strengths of corticomotoneuronal connections onto the two pools do exist.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Interhemispheric reorganization of motor hand function to the primary motor cortex predicted with functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "12088705", "authors": ["Rutten, GJ", "Ramsey, NF", "van Rijen, PC", "Franssen, H", "van Veelen, CW"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of child neurology", "abstract": "Many clinical syndromes in neuropsychiatry suggest focal brain activation.

Such effort-induced mirror movements indicate a decreased ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to selectively control individual muscles.

TCI was determined in ten healthy subjects by measuring the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) and the contralateral silent period (cSP) during a sustained contraction of the abductor digiti minimi, induced by focal unihemispheric ipsilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation. Mirror movements occurred in all subjects in response to the effort. There was a bilateral increase in cSPs and a parallel increase in the iSP in the contralateral working muscle. In contrast, the iSP in the mirroring muscle remained unchanged, explained by a balance of increased crossed pyramidal inhibition (cSP) and decreased transcallosal inhibition. In finely tuned unimanual movements, mirroring activity of the contralateral hand is suppressed by TCI originating in the working hemisphere. During sustained, effortful contractions, the outflow of the contralateral hemisphere is increased due to reduced TCI.

Responses to transcranial magnetic stimuli paired with electrical transmastoid stimuli were examined in biceps brachii in human subjects. Twelve interstimulus intervals (ISIs) from -6 ms (magnet before transmastoid) to 5 ms were investigated. When responses to the individual stimuli were set at 10-15 % of the maximal M-wave, responses to the paired stimuli were larger than expected at ISIs of -6 and -5 ms but were reduced in size at ISIs of -2 to 1 ms and at 3 to 5 ms. With individual responses of 3-5 % of maximal M-wave, facilitation still occurred at ISIs of -6 and -5 ms and depression of the paired response at ISIs of 0, 1, 4 and 5 ms. The interaction of the response to transmastoid stimulation with the multiple descending volleys elicited by magnetic stimulation of the cortex is complex. However, depression of the response to the paired stimuli at short ISIs is consistent with an occlusive interaction in which an antidromic volley evoked by the transmastoid stimulus collides with and annihilates descending action potentials evoked by the transcranial magnetic stimulus.

We present an overview of the more easily performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with weak current, which produces distinctly more pronounced changes in excitability than rTMS. The basic underlying mechanism is a shift in the resting membrane potential towards either hyper- or depolarisation, depending on stimulation polarity. This in turn leads to changes in the excitability of cortical neurons. Anodic stimulation increases cortical excitability, while cathodic stimulation decreases it. These changes persist after the end of stimulation if the stimulation lasts long enough, i.e., at least several minutes. The duration of this aftereffect can be controlled through the duration and intensity of the stimulation.

The mean CSP duration and motor threshold after TMS were significantly increased in the patient group. Intracortical inhibition by paired TMS at short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) showed no significant differences between patients and controls; at longer ISIs, the expected facilitation of test responses, observed in control subjects, resulted significantly less marked in SCA2 patients at all the tested intervals. Our findings extend previous findings on cerebellar dysfunctions of varying aetiologies by investigating intracortical excitability in SCA2. In addition, this study demonstrates that the cortical excitability involvement found in SCA2 is independent on the cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat expansion. The neurophysiological alterations seen in our patients relate to the worsening of general clinical condition. Thus, we might speculate that changes of motor cortex excitability in SCA2 represent a slow neurodegenerative process characterized by gradual loss of cerebellar neurons leading to an increasing disturbance of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the motor system.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "143", "title": "Dorsal and ventral visual stream contributions to perception-action interactions during pointing.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11976394", "authors": ["Lee, JH", "van Donkelaar, P"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The purpose of this study was to obtain physiological evidence in behaving human subjects on the mode of operation of the primary motor cortex during coordinated movements of the forelimb. We approached this problem by studying a pointing movement involving the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and index finger as follows. Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure the input-output (I/O) curves-a measure of the corticospinal pathway excitability-of proximal (anterior deltoid, AD, and triceps brachii, TB) and distal muscles (extensor carpi radialis, ECR, and first dorsal interosseus, 1DI) during isolated contraction of one of these muscles or during selective co-activation with other muscles involved in pointing. Compared to an isolated contraction of the ECR, the plateau-level of the ECR sigmoid I/O curve increased markedly during co-activation with the AD while pointing. In contrast, the I/O curve of AD was not influenced by activation of the more distal muscles involved in pointing. Moreover, the 1DI I/O curve was not influenced by activation of the more proximal muscles. Three arguments argue for a cortical site of facilitation of ECR motor potentials. First, ECR motor potentials evoked by a near threshold TMS stimulus were facilitated when the AD and ECR were co-activated during pointing but not those in response to a near threshold anodal electrical stimulus. Second, the ECR H reflex was not found to be task dependent, indicating that the recruitment gain of the ECR alpha-motoneuron pool did not differ between tasks. Finally, in comparison with an isolated ECR contraction, intracortical inhibition tested at the ECR cortical site was decreased during pointing. These results suggest that activation of shoulder, elbow, and wrist muscles involved in pointing appear to involve, at least in part, common motor cortical circuits. In contrast, at least in the pointing task, the motor cortical circuits involved in activation of the 1DI appear to act independently.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "125", "title": "Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on visual evoked potentials in migraine.", "issue": "Pt 4", "pmid": "11971104", "authors": ["Bohotin, V", "Fumal, A", "Vandenheede, M", "G\u00e9rard, P", "Bohotin, C", "Maertens de Noordhout, A", "Schoenen, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Previous neuroimaging studies provided evidence that visual mental imagery relies, in part, on the primary visual cortex.

The test stimulus for the forearm H-reflex and the conditioning stimulus to antagonist muscle afferents were applied to the median and radial nerves, respectively. The transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied noninvasively over the left motor cortex. The radial nerve conditioning strongly suppressed the H-reflex rather than the transcranial magnetic stimulation.

We measured motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in small hand and biceps brachii muscles before, during and after INB of the right hand. INB increased excitability of the cortical representation of (i) the intact hand and (ii) body parts proximal to the deafferented hand (upper arm), in the absence of excitability changes in other body part representations such as thorax or leg muscles. This effect persisted throughout the entire period of deafferentation and returned to baseline values afterward. Motor responses to brainstem electrical stimulation remained unchanged during INB, indicating that the effect is probably of cortical origin. Lorazepam, a GABA(A) receptor agonist, blocked this increased excitability. Interhemispheric inhibition between hand muscles decreased during INB. After chronic deafferentation in amputees, MEP amplitudes and motor output curves in small hand muscles were depressed and motor thresholds were elevated compared with aged-matched controls.

In the present study we have assessed intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) within ipsilateral motor cortex in 15 musicians and 15 non-musician controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) from left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle at rest, and during voluntary index finger abduction (0.5 N). Paired TMS with subthreshold conditioning was used to test early ICI with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) 1-5 ms, and ICF with ISIs 8-15 ms. Suprathreshold conditioning was used to test late ICI with ISIs 100-200 ms. TMS thresholds were similar in musicians and controls both at rest and with weak voluntary activation of FDI, indicating that postsynaptic excitability of corticospinal neurons was similar in both groups. ICI was less effective in musicians with FDI at rest and active, but only with an ISI of 3 ms. ICF was less effective in musicians under both rest and active conditions, and this was independent of ISI. There were no differences in late ICI between musicians and controls. We conclude that ICI and ICF circuits which are activated by weak TMS have less influence on corticospinal neuron excitability in musicians. Because of the dependence on ISI, the most likely explanation for the reduced ICI in musicians is an alteration of the interaction between the ICI circuit and neural elements responsible for the later I-waves evoked in corticospinal neurons by TMS. Excitability of the neural elements producing early and late ICI is not altered in musicians. Reduced ICF in musicians could be due to reduced excitability of neurons responsible for ICF, or an altered balance of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons which favours neurons that are not acted upon by the ICF circuit. The reduced influence of ICI and ICF circuits on corticospinal neuron excitability in musicians is likely to reflect a training-induced adaptation. It is not clear at present whether these differences represent an adaptive change related to their extraordinary control of finger movements, or alternatively a maladaptive change induced by \"overuse\" of the hands from extensive training.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: objective upper motor neuron markers.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11956348", "authors": ["Kaufmann, P", "Mitsumoto, H"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Current neurology and neuroscience reports", "abstract": "We studied the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on slow cortical potentials (SCPs) of the brain elicited during performance of a feedback and reward task.

This finding indicates that rTMS is an efficacious method to prevent relapse after PSD.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Inter- and intra-individual variability of paired-pulse curves with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10581221", "authors": ["Maeda, F", "Gangitano, M", "Thall, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We investigated the effect of previous musical training on lateralization of language as indexed by the effects of reading aloud on the modulation of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced in the first dorsal interosseus muscles (FDI) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex. We studied 13 right-handed subjects, seven musicians who had been playing a musical instrument for >10 years and six controls who had never studied a musical instrument. In all subjects, the amplitude of MEPs in the right FDI was facilitated by reading aloud. However, the musicians also showed significant facilitation in the left FDI, while controls did not. These results illustrate striking effects of musical training on lateralization of motor and language functions.", "pages": "177-81"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Time-related changes of excitability of the human motor system contingent upon immobilisation of the ring and little fingers.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10686179", "authors": ["Facchini, S", "Romani, M", "Tinazzi, M", "Aglioti, SM"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "In a blinded cross-over design, 10 healthy controls received 900 monophasic and biphasic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimuli over the primary motor cortex. Stimulation frequency was 1 Hz, and stimulation intensity 90% of the individual resting motor threshold. Suprathreshold stimuli applied at 0.1 Hz before and after repetitive stimulation controlled for changes in corticospinal excitability. We found a lasting corticospinal inhibition that was significantly more pronounced after monophasic than after biphasic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (motor evoked potential amplitude reduced by 35 +/- 20% vs 12 +/- 37%, mean+/- s.d.). We propose that the current flow in the coil plays a significant role in optimising after effects, and asymmetric current flow may be particularly efficient in building up tissue polarization.", "pages": "177-81"}]
