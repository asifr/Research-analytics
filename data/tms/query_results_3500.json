These seizures typically last 9-12s and, at times, are activated by hyperventilation and occasionally by photic stimulation. Generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures may also occur, especially in the juvenile form. There may be cognitive changes, in addition to linguistic and behavioral problems. Possible mechanisms for epileptogenesis may involve GABAergic systems, but especially T-calcium channels. The thalamus, especially the reticular nucleus, plays a major role, as does the frontal cortex, mainly the dorsolateral and orbital frontal areas, to the extent that some investigators have concluded that absence seizures are not truly generalized, but rather have selective cortical networks, mainly ventromesial frontal areas and the somatosensory cortex. The latter network is a departure from the more popular concept of a generalized epilepsy. Between the \"centrencephalic\" and \"corticoreticular\" theories, a \"unified\" theory is presented. Proposed genes include T-calcium channel gene CACNA1H, likely a susceptible gene in the Chinese Han population and a contributory gene in Caucasians. Electroencephalography has revealed an interictal increase in prefrontal activity, essential for the buildup of the ictal SW complexes maximal in that region. Infraslow activity can also be seen during ictal SW complexes. For treatment, counter to common belief, ethosuximide may not increase GTC seizures, as it reduces low-threshold T-calcium currents in thalamic neurons. Valproic acid and lamotrigine are also first-line medications. In addition, zonisamide and levetiracetam can be very helpful in absence epilepsy.", "pages": "404-12"}, {"volume": "205", "title": "Dual-task interference: attentional and neurophysiological influences.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19631693", "authors": ["Hiraga, CY", "Garry, MI", "Carson, RG", "Summers, JJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "Performing two tasks simultaneously often degrades performance of one or both tasks. While this dual-task interference is classically interpreted in terms of shared attentional resources, where two motor tasks are performed simultaneously interactions within primary motor cortex (i.e., activity-dependent coupling) may also be a contributing factor. In the present study TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) was used to examine the contribution of activity-dependent coupling to dual-task interference during concurrent performance of a bimanual coordination task and a discrete probe reaction time (RT) task involving the foot. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that activity-dependent coupling within the leg corticomotor pathway was greater during dual-task performance than single-task performance, and this was associated with interference on the probe RT task (i.e., increased RT). Experiment 3 revealed that dual-task interference occurred regardless of whether the dual-task involved two motor tasks or a motor and cognitive task, however activity-dependent coupling was present only when a dual motor task was performed. This suggests that activity-dependent coupling is less detrimental to performance than attentional processes operating upstream of the corticomotor system. Finally, while prioritising the RT task reduced, but did not eliminate, dual-task interference the contribution of activity-dependent coupling to dual-task interference was not affected by task prioritisation. This suggests that although activity-dependent coupling may contribute to dual motor-task interference, attentional processes appear to be more important. It also suggests that activity-dependent coupling may not be subject to modulation by attentional processes.", "pages": "404-12"}, {"volume": "169", "title": "A study of the effectiveness of high-frequency left prefrontal cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation in major depression in patients who have not responded to right-sided stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19631391", "authors": ["Fitzgerald, PB", "McQueen, S", "Herring, S", "Hoy, K", "Segrave, R", "Kulkarni, J", "Daskalakis, ZJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to explore the response rate to high-frequency left-sided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients who had failed to respond to right-sided low-frequency stimulation, and to investigate whether there was differential efficacy between stimulation at 5 or 10 Hz.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool that can be used to assess cortical physiological processes (e.g., inhibition, excitation) and has proven to be a useful diagnostic tool in brain disorders associated with alterations in cortical excitability. In this manuscript, we review studies that employ TMS to evaluate cortical excitability in patients with SUDs. Furthermore, we discuss preliminary studies that examine repetitive TMS (rTMS) as a potential treatment for patients with SUDs. Although the use of TMS to evaluate and to treat those individuals with SUDs is in its early stages, these studies reveal significant alterations in both cortical inhibition and excitation. Specifically, elevated cortical inhibition was reported in both cocaine and nicotine dependent individuals, while one study demonstrated an increase in cortical excitability in those who use 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Furthermore, three studies examining rTMS as a potential treatment in cocaine and nicotine addiction report decreases in the level of cravings and in the number of cigarettes smoked following rTMS administration to the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Thus, TMS has provided early interesting findings vis \u00e0 vis cortical excitability in SUDs. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that rTMS is efficacious in the treatment of cocaine and nicotine addiction. Further work is needed to enhance our understanding of the altered neurophysiology in SUDs as well as the ways in which rTMS treatment can be directed to optimize treatment.", "pages": "404-12"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Clinical significance of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the treatment of pharmacoresistant depression: synthesis of recent data.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19629020", "authors": ["Demitrack, MA", "Thase, ME"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Psychopharmacology bulletin", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a novel treatment for patients with major depressive disorder. Although clearly safer and better tolerated than many other pharmacotherapeutic options or electroconvulsive therapy, questions have persisted about the magnitude of the efficacy of TMS in patients with pharmacoresistant depression, and the clinical significance of these outcomes. Previous studies have explored whether specific patient characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood of clinical benefit. In the largest such analysis conducted to date, the authors confirmed previous observations that the lower the number of prior failed antidepressant treatments, the better the clinical outcome of treatment with TMS. This relationship between prior treatment resistance and subsequent treatment outcome is consistent with previous evidence from antidepressant studies. The authors examined the clinical significance of the treatment effects seen with TMS in pharmacoresistant major depression in their recently completed studies by comparing these outcomes with the results reported in several large, comprehensive published reference datasets of antidepressant medications studied in both treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant patient populations. The efficacy of TMS demonstrated in randomized controlled trials was comparable to that of pharmaceutical antidepressants studied in similarly designed registration trials and to the adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotic medications in controlled trials of antidepressant non-responders.

Here we tested the interhemispheric interactions between the IPS and the contralateral motor cortex (M1). We found that conditioning the right cIPS facilitated contralateral M1 when the conditioning stimulus had an intensity of 90% resting motor threshold (RMT) but not at 70% or 110% RMT. Facilitation was maximal when the interstimulus interval (ISI) between cIPS and M1 was 6 or 12 ms. These facilitatory effects were mediated by interactions with specific groups of interneurons in the contralateral M1. In fact, short intracortical inhibition (SICI) was reduced following cIPS stimulation. Moreover, additional comparison of facilitation of responses evoked by anterior-posterior versus posterior-anterior stimulation of M1 suggested that facilitation was more effective on early I1/I2 circuits than on I3 circuits. In contrast to these effects, stimulation of anterior IPS (aIPS) at 90% RMT induced inhibition, instead of facilitation, of contralateral M1 at ISIs of 10-12 ms. Finally, we found similar facilitation between left cIPS and right M1 although the conditioning stimuli had to have a higher intensity compared with stimulation of right cIPS (110% instead of 90% RMT). These findings demonstrate that different subregions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in humans exert both facilitatory and inhibitory effects towards the contralateral primary motor cortex.

In minimal self-reference subjective experiences are self-aware in the weak sense that there is something it feels like for the subject to experience something. In autonoetic consciousness, consciousness emerges, by definition, by retrieval of memories of personally experienced events (episodic memory). It has been shown with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that a medial paralimbic circuitry is critical for self-reference. This circuitry includes anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate/medial parietal cortices, connected directly and via thalamus. We here hypothesized that interaction in the circuitry may bind conscious experiences with widely different degrees of self-reference through synchrony of high frequency oscillations as a common neural event.

Healthy volunteers had to respond fast with their right and left index fingers to right- and left-pointing arrows. These central target stimuli were preceded by flanking arrows, inducing premature response tendencies which competed with correct response activation. The time point of maximum premature activation was individually measured as peak latency of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in the EEG. In the subsequent TMS experiment, single pulses were applied to left or right M1(HAND) during the same flanker task.

When flankers were incompatible with the target, excitability of the prematurely activated M1(HAND) gradually decreased during this 90 ms period. This decrease was paralleled by a mirror-symmetrical increase in excitability in the other M1(HAND). These results show that the inappropriate response tendency is cancelled in one M1(HAND) simultaneously with activation of the correct response in the other.

Working memory (WM), a cognitive task involving the on-line maintenance and manipulation of information, elicits increases in gamma oscillations with greater cognitive demand, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The generation and modulation of gamma oscillations have been attributed to inhibitory interneuron networks that use gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their principal neurotransmitter. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents a non-invasive method to stimulate the cortex that has been shown to modify cognition and GABA inhibitory mechanisms, particularly with higher frequencies (ie, 10-20 Hz). We measured the effect of high-frequency rTMS applied to the DLPFC on gamma-oscillations elicited during the N-back WM task in healthy individuals. Active rTMS significantly increased gamma-oscillations generated during the N-back conditions with the greatest cognitive demand. Further, no significant changes were found in other frequency ranges, suggesting that rTMS selectively modulates gamma-oscillations in the frontal brain regions.

Only 25% of people, who have seizures and status epilepticus, have epilepsy as well. In the intensive care settings, seizures and status epilepticus are a common neurologic complication, which is attributable to primary neurologic pathology (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, central nervous system infection, head trauma) or secondary to critical illness (anoxic brain damage, intoxications, metabolic abnormalities) and clinical management. There are three main subtypes of status epilepticus in intensive care units: generalized convulsive status epilepticus, focal motor status epilepticus, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A seizure is a consequence of electrical neurological derangement because of sudden imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory forces within the network of cortical neurons. The main inhibiting neurotransmitter in the brain is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which binds to GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. The main excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Different ions (Cl(-), K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+)) also play a role in the pathophysiology of seizures. Prolonged status epilepticus may lead to different systemic and neurologic consequences. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is one of the most common emergencies encountered in clinical practice, which requires immediate treatment. The first-line drugs are benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam), the second-line ones - phenytoin and fosphenytoin. For the treatment of refractory status epilepticus, barbiturates (phenobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental), valproate, midazolam, propofol, and isoflurane are used. The dosage of drugs and parameters to monitor are referred in the article. The mortality from generalized convulsive status epilepticus is 15-50%; the main factors, influencing prognosis, are the cause and the duration of status epilepticus and age of a patient.", "pages": "404-12"}, {"volume": "90", "title": "Pulsed electromagnetic fields to reduce diabetic neuropathic pain and stimulate neuronal repair: a randomized controlled trial.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "18524898", "authors": ["Weintraub, MI", "Herrmann, DN", "Smith, AG", "Backonja, MM", "Cole, SP"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation", "abstract": "The cerebellum is a crucial structure involved in movement control and cognitive processing. Noninvasive stimulation of the cerebellum results in neurophysiological and behavioral changes, an effect that has been attributed to modulation of cerebello-brain connectivity. At rest, the cerebellum exerts an overall inhibitory tone over the primary motor cortex (M1), cerebello-brain inhibition (CBI), likely through dentate-thalamo-cortical connections. The level of excitability of this pathway before and after stimulation of the cerebellum, however, has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine changes in M1, brainstem, and CBI before and after 25 min of anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right cerebellar cortex. We hypothesized that anodal tDCS would result in an enhancement of CBI and cathodal would decrease it, relative to sham stimulation. We found that cathodal tDCS resulted in a clear decrease of CBI, whereas anodal tDCS increased it, in the absence of changes after sham stimulation. These effects were specific to the cerebello-cortical connections with no changes in other M1 or brainstem excitability measures. The cathodal effect on CBI was found to be dependent on stimulation intensity and lasted up to 30 min after the cessation of tDCS. These results suggest that tDCS can modulate in a focal and polarity-specific manner cerebellar excitability, likely through changes in Purkinje cell activity.

Subjects were asked to flex their index finger, at will after an acoustic signal, while surface EMGs from Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (prime mover) and from BB (postural muscle) were recorded. In each experiment, tendon (T) reflexes in the resting BB and motor-evoked potentials elicited by magnetic cortical stimulation (CMEPs) in the resting, or in the slightly contracted BB, were collected both during the iAPA development and before the go signal. When BB was fully relaxed, T-reflexes falling in the iAPA temporal window were un-modulated, while CMEPs were significantly inhibited; this inhibition occurred, on average, 37 ms before the iAPA onset indicating that iAPA sets up and develops at supraspinal level. Changes in CMEPs' excitability clearly anticipated the iAPA onset (about 50 ms) also when cortico-spinal excitability was probed in the active BB, thus indicating that this effect is likely due to a de-recruitment of spinal motoneurones. Thus, (1) iAPA is associated with voluntary movement even when postural muscles are at rest, (2) during iAPA spinal motoneurones are more likely disfacilitated than inhibited, and (3) the iAPA timing is regulated similarly to prime mover activation.

We investigated the neurophysiological effects of rTMS delivered during the delay period of a visual working memory task by simultaneously recording brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects performed visual working memory for locations or for shapes, and in half the trials a 10-Hz train of rTMS was delivered to the superior parietal lobule (SPL) or a control brain area. The wide range of individual differences in the effects of rTMS on task accuracy, from improvement to impairment, was predicted by individual differences in the effect of rTMS on power in the alpha-band of the EEG ( approximately 10 Hz): a decrease in alpha-band power corresponded to improved performance, whereas an increase in alpha-band power corresponded to the opposite. The EEG effect was localized to cortical sources encompassing the frontal eye fields and the intraparietal sulcus, and was specific to task (location, but not object memory) and to rTMS target (SPL, not control area). Furthermore, for the same task condition, rTMS-induced changes in cross-frequency phase synchrony between alpha- and gamma-band (>40 Hz) oscillations predicted changes in behavior. These results suggest that alpha-band oscillations play an active role cognitive processes and do not simply reflect absence of processing.

The triple stimulation technique (TST, Magistris et al. in Brain 121(Pt 3):437-450, 1998) was used to quantify a central conduction index (CCI = amplitude ratio of central conduction response and peripheral nerve response, obtained simultaneously by the TST). The CCI removes effects of peripheral fatigue from the quantification. It allows a quantification of the percentage of the entire target muscle motor unit pool driven to discharge by a transcranial magnetic stimulus. Subjects (n = 23) performed repetitive maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of abductor digiti minimi (duration 1 s, frequency 0.5 Hz) during 2 min. TST recordings were obtained every 15 s, using stimulation intensities sufficient to stimulate all cortical motor neurons (MNs) leading to the target muscle, and during voluntary contractions of 20% of the MVC to facilitate the responses. TST was also repetitively recorded during recovery. This basic exercise protocol was modified in a number of experiments to further characterize influences on CCI of motor fatigue (4 min exercise at 50% MVC; delayed fatigue recovery during local hemostasis, \"stimulated exercise\" by 20 Hz trains of 1 s duration at 0.5 Hz during 2 min). In addition, the cortical silent period was measured during the basic exercise protocol. Force fatigued to approximately 40% of MVC in all experiments and in all subjects. In all subjects, CCI decreased during exercise, but this decrease varied markedly between subjects. On average, CCI reductions preceded force reductions during exercise, and CCI recovery preceded force recovery. Exercising at 50% for 4 min reduced muscle force more markedly than CCI. Hemostasis induced by a cuff delayed muscle force recovery, but not CCI recovery. Stimulated exercise reduced force markedly, but CCI decreased only marginally. Summarized, force reduction and reduction of the CCI related poorly quantitatively and in time, and voluntary drive was particularly critical to reduce the CCI. The fatigue induced reduction of CCI may result from a central inhibitory phenomenon. Voluntary muscle activation is critical for the CCI reduction, suggesting a primarily supraspinal mechanism.", "pages": "404-12"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Plasticity in the developing brain: implications for rehabilitation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "18664439", "authors": ["Johnston, MV"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Developmental disabilities research reviews", "abstract": "Active compounds in cannabis such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) interact with the inhibitory neurotransmitter delta-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but little is known about the functional effects of cannabis on human cortical brain processes. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether patients with chronic cannabis use demonstrate abnormalities in cortical inhibition or excitability. In all, 42 chronic cannabis using subjects (divided into heavy and light using subjects) and 19 controls were included in the study. Single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation were used to assess a number of parameters of cortical inhibition and cortical excitability. In addition, psychomotor function and THC plasma levels were measured. Both cannabis using groups (heavy and light use) demonstrated a reduction in short interval cortical inhibition compared with healthy controls, but there was no difference in other measures of cortical inhibition or cortical excitability. There was also no difference between the two groups on measures of psychomotor performance. Chronic cannabis use is associated with a reduction in cortical inhibition potentially related to activity at the GABA(A) receptors. Further research is required to explore whether this results from chronic cannabis use or reflects an underlying predisposition to developing chronic substance use problems.", "pages": "404-12"}, {"volume": "364", "title": "Neural networks engaged in milliseconds and seconds time processing: evidence from transcranial magnetic stimulation and patients with cortical or subcortical dysfunction.", "issue": "1525", "pmid": "18072277", "authors": ["Koch, G", "Oliveri, M", "Caltagirone, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
