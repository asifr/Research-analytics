IHI can be investigated by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) whereby, in half of the trials, a test stimulus (TS) over one hemisphere is preceded by a conditioning stimulus (CS) over the other hemisphere. Whereas various studies have investigated IHI in rest, less is known about interhemispheric interactions during voluntary muscle activation. Here, we investigated the influence of tonic muscle activity (5% of the maximal voluntary contraction) in either the right wrist flexor or extensor versus rest on IHI from the active (left) to the resting (right) hemisphere. Our main finding was that tonic activation of the right wrist flexor, led to an increase in IHI from the active (dominant left) to the resting (non-dominant right) hemisphere as compared to rest. A control experiment employed the same design but CS intensity was lowered to match MEP amplitudes of the conditioning hand between active and rest conditions. This resulted in a relative decrease of IHI. It is hypothesized that functional regulation of IHI might prevent the occurrence of mirror activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) of the resting hemisphere and, thus, might play an important role in the execution of unimanual actions.", "pages": "209-13"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "State-dependency of transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18791818", "authors": ["Silvanto, J", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain topography", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a tool that allows noninvasive modulation of cortical neural activity, has become an important tool in cognitive neuroscience and is being increasingly explored in neurotherapeutics. Amongst the factors that are likely to influence its efficacy, the importance of the baseline cortical activation state on the impact of TMS has not received much attention. However, this state-dependency is important as the neural impact of any external stimulus represents an interaction with the ongoing brain activity at the time of stimulation. The effects of any external stimulus are therefore not only determined by the properties of that stimulus but also by the activation state of the brain. Here we review the existing evidence on the state-dependency of TMS and propose how its systematic study can provide unique insights into brain function and significantly enhance the effectiveness of TMS in investigations on the neural basis of perception and cognition. We also describe novel approaches based on this state-dependency which can be used to investigate the properties of distinct neural subpopulations within the stimulated region. Furthermore, we discuss how state-dependency can explain the functional mechanisms through which TMS impairs perception and behavior.", "pages": "209-13"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Reduced intracortical and interhemispheric inhibitions in corticobasal syndrome.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11087001", "authors": ["Pal, PK", "Gunraj, CA", "Li, JY", "Lang, AE", "Chen, R"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits, interhemispheric inhibitory circuits and corticospinal excitability for both distal and proximal muscles were investigated in seven patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and seven healthy volunteers.

Here, we review the role of primary motor cortex (M1) in this function. M1 receives and integrates input from a range of cortical and subcortical sites. It is also the final cortical processing site for voluntary motor commands, before they descend to the spinal cord. Inhibitory networks within M1 may be an important mechanism for the prevention or suppression of movement. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to evaluate corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition in humans, during the performance of a range of movement selection and prevention tasks. This review explores how M1 intracortical inhibition is selectively reduced to initiate desired voluntary movements, while movement prevention is associated with rapid, non-selective recruitment of inhibition within M1. The relationship between deficient intracortical inhibition and behavioural inhibition is also explored. Examples of neuropathology are reviewed, including focal dystonia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome. The strengths and limitations of TMS in the study of movement prevention are also discussed. While the precise functional links between M1 neuronal populations and the fronto-basal-ganglia network activated by movement prevention have yet to be elucidated, it is clear that M1 plays a critical role in the final processing stage of response inhibition.", "pages": "209-13"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "[What is needed for rTMS to become a treatment?].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "12417458", "authors": ["Foucher, JR", "Luck, D", "Chassagnon, S", "Offerlin-Meyer, I", "Pham, BT"], "year": "2007", "journal": "L'Enc\u00e9phale", "abstract": "Repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modulate cortical excitability. Consequently, it appears appealing for the treatment of some affections such as depression or hallucinations. There is already some proof that the concept is valid, but rTMS is slow in progressing in the therapeutic field as a true armamentum. Indeed its effects are of short duration and even inconstant from one patient to the next. These drawbacks depend on certain factors that we will discuss. Until now, there has been inadequate control of the stimulation site. It is possible that this site could vary on an individual basis. It seems logical to propose the use of functional imaging for such a purpose, but its use should be adapted to the symptom. Even after localizing the site, the coil has to be placed accurately. This could be facilitated by a neuronavigator. Stimulation protocols are currently defined by three parameters: the frequency modulating the cortical action either as a stimulation (>5 Hz) or an inhibition (<1 Hz), the intensity and the number of stimuli influencing, notably, the amplitude and duration of the effect. Unfortunately, the effect is inconstant in a given patient and paradoxical reactions have been observed in more than 15% of normal individuals. Improved reliability and amplification of the effect rely on the better control of other parameters: pattern of stimulation, pre and post-conditioning, state of the cortex during stimulation, associated medications, endogenous idiosyncratic factors and related pathology.

The changes in MEP latency, amplitude and silent period (SP) duration induced by stimulation directly upon the skull, and 1 cm away from the skull were analyzed by computing the probability density distribution (PDD) for the responses obtained from all subjects. This measure corresponds to the finite probability that the event occurs within a given area. Overall, the results were consistent with a distance-induced decrease in magnetic field strength. However, the increase in coil-to-skull distance induced a higher probability of longer latencies in active muscle when stimulating with either coil. Also, stimulating at a distance with the figure-of-eight coil increased the probability of a longer SP duration. The stimulation strength at the two distances was comparable because it was set based on the motor threshold obtained for each distance. Therefore, our results are not entirely compatible with the established exponential drop in magnetic field with increasing distance. Rather, they suggest that a more complex set of interactions occurs in the cortex. The results imply that distinct patterns of cortical network activation may exist related to the distance-induced alterations when the coil is moved away from the skull.

Differences between the MEP and CMEP were also investigated to assess whether any changes were occurring at the cortical or spinal levels. In both Sol and MG, MEP and CMEP amplitudes [normalized to maximal M wave (Mmax)] showed an increase, followed by a plateau, over the greater part of the contraction range with responses increasing from approximately 0.2 to approximately 6% of Mmax for Sol and from approximately 0.3 to approximately 10% of Mmax for MG. Because both MEPs and CMEPs changed in a similar manner, the observed increase and lack of decrease at high force levels are likely related to underlying changes occurring at the spinal level.

Single-photon emission computed tomography with (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer was performed in 14 right-handed male patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression before and after low-frequency TMS of the right DLPFC. Five 60-second 1-Hz trains were applied and 12 treatment sessions were administered within a 3-week period (total pulses, 3,600). The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered and the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2). After TMS treatment in 14 patients, the score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression decreased significantly, and considerable decreases in rCBF were seen in the bilateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, anterior insula, right subgenual cingulate, and left parietal cortex, but no significant increase in rCBF occurred. Additionally, as compared with 8 nonresponders, 6 responders showed significant increases in rCBF at baseline in the left hemisphere including the prefrontal and limbic-paralimbic regions.

Head-fixed subjects reported their perceived visual straight-ahead position using both left and right eye monocular vision, before and after 15 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS over left somatosensory but not over left motor cortex shifted the perceived visual straight ahead to the left, whereas nonvisual detection of body midline was unchanged for either brain area.

To link this effect more tightly to an altered ocular proprioception, we applied a passive deviation to the right eye before the visual straight-ahead task. Passive eye displacement modulated the shift in the perceived straight ahead induced by somatosensory rTMS, without affecting the perceived straight ahead at baseline or after motor cortex rTMS.

Cortical targets are especially appealing, because they are easily accessible by noninvasive or invasive methods. Applicable techniques include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial electrical stimulation using pulsed or direct current, and epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) with surgically implanted electrodes. In contrast to deep brain stimulation in movement disorders or electroconvulsive therapy in depression, the efficacy of cortical stimulation to treat neurological or psychiatric disorders has not been yet clearly demonstrated. However, encouraging results have been reported in neuropathic pain (for ECS) and depression (for rTMS). In this review, we will consider some principles and mechanisms of action of these methods. First, it must be noted that fibers of intracortical or cortico-subcortical networks are more prone to be activated by the stimulation than cell bodies of local cortical neurons. Hence, the site(s) of action may be distant from the site of stimulation. In addition, various parameters of stimulation (such as stimulation frequency, intensity, or electrode polarity) and the configuration of the induced electrical field greatly influence the nature of the recruited circuits, and therefore, the overall efficacy. Finally, clinical changes may be delayed and prolonged beyond the time of stimulation, complicating programming algorithms in the case of implanted stimulation device.

While both techniques have reliably demonstrated similarities in the pattern of activity induced by action production and action observation, the relationship they bear with each other remains elusive. In the present study, we combined ongoing EEG recordings and single-pulse TMS during the execution, imagination and observation of simple hand actions. Relationship between MEPs and EEG frequency bands at the individual level was investigated. Our results replicate those obtained independently with both techniques: a significant increase in MEP amplitude and a significant attenuation of the mu rhythm during action observation, imagination and execution compared to rest. Surprisingly, we found no significant correlation between MEP amplitude and mu rhythm modulation. However, modulation in the low to midrange beta (12-18Hz) was related to MEP size during the rest and execution conditions.

When no phasic voluntary movements preceded TBS, iTBS elicited facilitatory and cTBS elicited inhibitory aftereffects on MEP size.

The intension of the current study, therefore, was to directly evaluate the relationship between these neurophysiological processes in healthy subjects. Eleven right-handed healthy subjects participated in this experiment in which gamma band activity was measured through simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) during the N-back task, a cognitive task designed to index WM.

This increase in signal was no longer present 24 hours after blindfold removal. Finally, reversible disruption of occipital cortex function on the fifth day (by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; rTMS) impaired Braille character recognition ability in the blindfold group but not in non-blindfolded controls.

We aimed to evaluate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could be effective in modulating the emotional aspects of pain as to further explore mechanisms of tDCS in pain relief. Twenty-three healthy subjects rated images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain (baseline), and then received stimulation with tDCS under four different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), occipital cortex (V1); and sham tDCS. The order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. During each stimulation session (after 3 min of stimulation), subjects were shown a new set of aversive images and were again asked to rate the images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain. The results showed that ratings of unpleasantness and discomfort/pain were significantly decreased during DLPFC tDCS only, as compared to baseline and sham tDCS. The other conditions of stimulation (M1 and V1 tDCS) did not result in any significant changes. These results support the notion that DLPFC is a critical area for the emotional processing of pain and also suggests that DLPFC may be a potential target of stimulation for alleviation of pain with a significant emotional-affective component.

For oscillatory brain activity around 10 Hz in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) it is discussed whether it is associated with the level of cortical excitation. However, it is not clear whether the relation between 10 Hz EEG oscillatory activity and cortical excitability is a global, locally very unspecific phenomenon or whether focal 10 Hz oscillations in the human brain are a highly specific correlate of the cortical excitation level. To determine this open question, multichannel EEG was combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the primary motor cortex in this study. The present data showed that a motor evoked potential was elicited more easily when alpha power immediately preceding the magnetic pulse was low, and vice versa. Interestingly, this effect was only found for very local EEG alpha activity at sites overlying the cortical motor areas to which the TMS pulses were applied. This was verified using source localization in 3D space. These data provide evidence that the magnitude of motor cortical excitability is determined by the amount of topographically specific alpha oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex.", "pages": "209-13"}, {"volume": "586", "title": "Theta burst stimulation induces after-effects on contralateral primary motor cortex excitability in humans.", "issue": "Pt 18", "pmid": "17524673", "authors": ["Suppa, A", "Ortu, E", "Zafar, N", "Deriu, F", "Paulus, W", "Berardelli, A", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Recent psychophysics studies suggest that the behavioral impact of a visual stimulus and its conscious visual recognition underlie two functionally dissociated neuronal processes. Previous TMS studies have demonstrated that certain features of a visual stimulus can still be processed despite TMS-induced disruption of perception. Here, we tested whether symbolic action priming also remains intact despite TMS-induced masking of the prime. We applied single-pulse TMS over primary visual cortex at various temporal intervals from 20 ms to 120 ms during a supraliminal action priming paradigm. This TMS protocol enabled us to identify at what exact time point a TMS-induced activity disruption of primary visual cortex interferes with conscious visual perception of the prime versus (un)conscious behavioral priming of the visual target stimulus. We also introduced spatial uncertainty by presenting visual stimuli either above or below the fixation cross, while the TMS pulse was always targeting the prime presented below fixation. We revealed that TMS over primary visual cortex interferes with both conscious visual perception and symbolic behavioral priming in a temporarily and spatially specific manner, i.e., only when disrupting primary visual cortex at approximately the same temporal stage between 60 and 100 ms after prime onset, and only for those prime stimuli presented below fixation. These findings are in disagreement with the idea of subliminal action priming being mediated by neural pathways bypassing striate cortex, and rather suggest that symbolic action priming relies on an intact neural transmission along the retino-geniculo-striate pathway.

To perform this task accurately, the visual vector, i.e., the distance between a central fixation point and the peripheral stimulus, must be inverted from one visual hemifield to the other. Recent data in humans and monkeys suggest that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) might be critically involved in the process of visual vector inversion. In the present study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual vector inversion in the human PPC by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In six healthy subjects, single pulse TMS was applied over the right PPC during a memory antisaccade task at four different time intervals: 100 ms, 217 ms, 333 ms, or 450 ms after target onset. The results indicate that for rightward antisaccades, i.e., when the visual target was presented in the left screen-half, TMS had a significant effect on saccade gain when applied 100 ms after target onset, but not later. For leftward antisaccades, i.e., when the visual target was presented in the right screen-half, a significant TMS effect on gain was found for the 333 ms and 450 ms conditions, but not for the earlier ones.

In addition, the effects of changes to visuospatial and temporal order demands were examined by contrasting performance in the presence and the absence of target location information. Results revealed that the SEF supports the processing of spatial information relevant to saccade amplitude.
