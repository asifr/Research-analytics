The goal of the current study was to characterize the contributions made by the left and right posterior parietal cortices (lPPC and rPPC) to the interaction between visuospatial attention and the generation of smooth pursuit eye movements. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to temporarily disrupt each area at different times around target motion onset in a pursuit task that explicitly manipulated the covert orienting of attention. TMS over the lPPC, rPPC and a control site (the vertex) evoked a similar pattern of results, in that the earlier TMS delivery times caused a reduced pursuit latency compared to baseline measures, while TMS immediately prior to target motion onset resulted in latencies slower than baseline. In addition, however, TMS over the lPPC and rPPC (but not the vertex) preferentially influenced the generation of contralateral pursuit, with the lPPC doing so in a relatively time-independent manner, and the rPPC doing so in a time-dependent manner.

Fifty-five unmedicated PD patients were classified into four groups: two groups (early and late PD) received 25 Hz rTMS bilaterally on the motor arm and leg areas; other groups acted as control for frequency (10 Hz) and for site of stimulation (occipital stimulation). All patients received six consecutive daily sessions (3,000 pulses for each session).

Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), walking time, key-tapping speed, and self-assessment scale were measured for each patient before and after each rTMS session and before and after the monthly sessions. Compared to occipital stimulation, 25 Hz rTMS over motor areas improved all measures in both early and late groups; the group that received 10 Hz rTMS improved more than the occipital group but less than the 25 Hz groups. The effect built up gradually during the sessions and was maintained for 1 month after, with a slight reduction in efficacy.

Measurement of muscle contractile properties during voluntary contractions is reproducible in fresh muscle and reveals faster and slower muscle relaxation rates in heated and fatigued muscle, respectively. The technique is more sensitive to altered muscle state than the traditional motor nerve resting twitch. Use of TMS during sustained maximal contractions reveals slowing of muscle contraction and relaxation with different time courses and a decline in voluntary activation.

Manipulation of the axes of rotation of forearm movements reversed the relative stability of simultaneous and alternating patterns of bimanual coordination. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex revealed that these manipulations of postural context altered the crossed modulation of excitability in corticospinal pathways that arises from movement of the opposite limb. Furthermore, modulation of responses to electrical stimulation of the cervicomedullary junction indicated that crossed modulation was also expressed at the level of the spinal motoneurons. Our data support the view that crossed modulation of excitability in corticospinal pathways mediates the stability of bimanual coordination.

In Experiment 1, subjects underwent four 8-min 1-Hz rTMS sessions in a within-subject design. rTMS sites were the medial cerebellum (real and sham rTMS), left lateral cerebellum, and right lateral cerebellum. Following each rTMS session, subjects completed a subsecond temporal bisection task (stimuli in the range 400-800 msec). Compared with sham rTMS, rTMS applied over the right lateral or medial cerebellum induced a leftward shift of the psychophysical function (perceived lengthening of time). In Experiment 2, a separate sample of subjects underwent the identical rTMS procedure and completed a suprasecond bisection task (stimuli in the 1000-2000 msec range). In this experiment, rTMS to the cerebellar sites did not produce any significant changes compared with sham rTMS. Experiment 3 employed a within-subject design to replicate findings from Experiments 1 and 2. Subjects underwent four rTMS conditions (sub- and suprabisection tasks following medial cerebellar and sham rTMS). rTMS induced a significant leftward shift of psychophysical function in the subsecond bisection, but not in the suprasecond bisection. In this study, we have demonstrated that transient cerebellar stimulation can differently affect the ability to estimate time intervals below and above a duration of 1 sec. The results of this study provide direct evidence for the role of the cerebellum in processing subsecond time intervals.

We combined single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex with a simple RT task with variable preparatory delays. We found that, in line with typical behavioral observations, the subjects' RTs decreased with increasing response signal expectancy. TMS results revealed a modulation of corticospinal excitability in correspondence with response signal expectancy. Besides an increased excitability over the time-course of the preparatory delay, corticospinal excitability transiently increased whenever a response signal was expected. Paired-pulse TMS showed that this modulation is unlikely to be mediated by excitability changes in interneuronal inhibitory or facilitatory networks in the primary motor cortex.

This view has changed radically during the past 20 years using new tools designed to study plasticity in the adult human brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a valuable non-invasive technique for exploring the ability of the motor cortex to change during motor skill acquisition. Results obtained with TMS in neurological patients as well as in normal subjects demonstrate that cortical plasticity is a necessity for correct adaptation to the continuously changing environment. Topographical reorganization of the motor cortex depends on the types of movements performed by the subjects. During simple training, the cortical representation is enlarged, and it returns to its initial size when the task is overlearned. These transient modifications characterize simple motor training. Motor skills in which coordination of distal and proximal muscles, precision of the task and spatio-temporal constraints are associated, has a different impact on cortical reorganization. We propose that years of practice of a complex motor skill induces a new cortical topography that must be interpreted as structural plasticity which provides the capacity to execute a plastic behaviour instead of a stereotypical movement. We review the neuronal mechanisms underlying plasticity in different types of movement. We stress new emerging notions, such as overlap of cortical maps, and system dynamics at single neuron and network levels, to explain the reorganization of movement representations that encode motor skill. Dendritic arborizations as functional computing elements, newly generated neurons in adult brain, and plastic architectures of cortical networks operating as distributed functional modules are new hypotheses for structural plasticity.", "pages": "504-8"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Online maintenance of sensory and motor representations: effects on corticospinal excitability.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16005617", "authors": ["van den Hurk, P", "Mars, RB", "van Elswijk, G", "Hegeman, J", "Pasman, JW", "Bloem, BR", "Toni, I"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impulses, (0.5 Hz, 3 impulses) were presented at threshold intensity to male WAG/Rij rats.

The deficit recovered when the cortical excitability of an extensive network involving both cerebellar hemispheres and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was decreased by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Although inhibition of the right DLPFC or a control fronto-parietal region did not modify the patient's performance, inhibition of the right (unaffected) cerebellum and the left DLPFC markedly improved task performance. These findings could be explained by the modulation of a set of inhibitory and excitatory connections between the lateral cerebellum and the contralateral prefrontal area induced by rTMS. The presence of left cerebellar damage is likely associated with a reduced excitatory drive from sub-cortical left cerebellar nuclei towards the right DLPFC, causing reduced excitability of the right DLPFC and, conversely, unbalanced activation of the left DLPFC.
