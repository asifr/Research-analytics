Although an intervention strategy targeting the extensors of the affected upper limb might thus be expected to have benefits for functional recovery, conventional repetitive motor training has limited clinical utility. Recent studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could induce motor recovery. The present study tested whether 5\u2009Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the upper-limb area of the primary motor cortex, combined with extensor motor training, had a greater effect on motor recovery than either intervention alone in stroke hemiparesis. Nine patients with chronic subcortical stroke and nine age-matched healthy subjects completed the crossover study. In separate sessions, we examined the single intervention effect of repetitive wrist and finger extension exercises aided by neuromuscular stimulation, the single intervention effect of 5\u2009Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and the combined effect of the two interventions. The motor functions were evaluated behaviourally in patients (Experiment 1) and electrophysiologically in healthy subjects (Experiment 2), both before and after the intervention. In addition, we tested the long-term effect by repeating the combined interventions 12 times in patients (Experiment 3). The motor functions were measured again 2 weeks after the end of the repetitive intervention period. In Experiment 1, the combined intervention, but neither of the single interventions, resulted in an improvement of extensor movement (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and grip power (P\u2009<\u20090.05), along with a reduction of flexor hypertonia (P\u2009<\u20090.01), in their paretic upper limbs.

In Experiment 3, we also confirmed long-term beneficial effects of the combined intervention in patients. These findings indicate that combining motor training with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can facilitate use-dependent plasticity and achieve functional recovery of motor impairments that cannot be attained by either intervention alone.

In half the trials, a conditioning stimulus (130% right APB RMT) was applied to the APB hotspot in the dominant hemisphere 10 ms prior to the TS. Targeted ballistic contractions of the right APB were found to modulate (increase) IHI measured in the left APB, as previously reported for tonic contractions. Furthermore, the extent of the IHI increase was found to scale with the strength of the contralateral ballistic or tonic contraction. Less pronounced, but statistically significant, IHI increases were also observed in the left abductor digiti minimi and extensor carpi radialis during right APB contraction. For these muscles, however, the extent of the IHI modulation was independent of APB contraction strength. The capacity to modulate inhibition during contractions was unaffected by advancing age.

We used the finite element method (FEM) together with a high-resolution volume mesh of the human head to better characterize the field induced in cortical gray matter (GM). The volume mesh was constructed from T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images to allow for an anatomically accurate modeling of the gyrification pattern. Five tissue types were taken into account, corresponding to skin, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) including the ventricles as well as cortical gray and white matter. We characterized the effect of the current direction on the electric field distribution in GM. Importantly, the field strength in GM was increased by up to 51% when the induced currents were perpendicular to the local gyrus orientation. This effect was mainly restricted to the gyral crowns and lips, but did not extend into the sulcal walls. As a result, the focality of the fields induced in GM was increased. This enhancement effect might in part underlie the dependency of stimulation thresholds on coil orientation, as commonly observed in TMS motor cortex studies.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was applied in 40 male right-handers (19-30 yrs) during line tracing with dominant and nondominant hand, with and without visual guidance. Results revealed a network of areas activating more in the right than left hemisphere, irrespective of the effector. Inferior portions of frontal gyrus and parietal lobe overlapped largely with a previously described ventral attention network responding to unexpected or behaviourally relevant stimuli. This demonstrates a hitherto unreported functionality of this circuit that also seems to activate when spatial information is continuously exploited to adapt motor behaviour. Second, activation of left dorsal premotor and postcentral regions during tracing with the nondominant left hand was more pronounced than that in their right hemisphere homologues during tracing with the dominant right hand. These activation asymmetries of motor areas ipsilateral to the moving hand could not be explained by asymmetries in skill performance, the degree of handedness, or interhemispheric interactions. The latter was measured by a double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm, whereby a conditioning stimulus was applied over one hemisphere and a test stimulus over the other.

Such improvement in tactile detection ipsilateral to TMS could follow from interhemispheric rivalry, if one assumes that TMS disrupted cortical processing under the coil and thereby released the other hemisphere from inhibition. Here we extended the study by Seyal et al. (1995) to determine the effects of right parietal TMS on tactile processing for either hand, rather than only the ipsilateral hand. We performed two experiments applying TMS in the context of median-nerve stimulation; one experiment required somatosensory detection, the second somatosensory intensity discrimination. We found different TMS effects on detection versus discrimination, but neither set of results followed the prediction from hemispheric rivalry that enhanced performance for one hand should invariably be associated with impaired performance for the other hand, and vice-versa.

Left FDI MEPs were suppressed during bilateral compared with unilateral forces, with a stronger suppression when the right index finger force was exerted in the adduction direction regardless of hand posture. IHI targeting the left FDI increased during bilateral compared with unilateral forces and this increase was stronger during right index finger adduction despite the posture of the right hand. SICI decreased to a similar extent during both bilateral forces in both hand postures. Thus generation of index finger isometric forces away from the body midline (adduction direction), regardless of the muscle engaged in the task, down-regulates corticospinal output in the contralateral active hand to a greater extent than forces exerted toward the body midline (abduction direction).

In order to reveal a non-linear dose-dependent effect of dopamine on cortical plasticity in humans, we explored the impact of 25, 100 and 200 mg of L-dopa on transcranial direct current (tDCS)-induced plasticity in twelve healthy human subjects. The primary motor cortex served as a model system, and plasticity was monitored by motor evoked potential amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. As compared to placebo medication, low and high dosages of L-dopa abolished facilitatory as well as inhibitory plasticity, whereas the medium dosage prolonged inhibitory plasticity, and turned facilitatory plasticity into inhibition. Thus the results show clear non-linear, dosage-dependent effects of dopamine on both facilitatory and inhibitory plasticity, and support the assumption of the importance of a specific dosage of dopamine optimally suited to improve plasticity.

In five patients with molecularly proven diagnosis of CS and in a group of 13 age-matched control subjects we investigated activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. To this end, we used a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which left ulnar nerve stimuli were followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses to right cortical hand area, and recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) by single pulse TMS from left first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle before and after PAS.

In these two subgroups, MEPs were measured before, immediately after and 30 min after PAS in the left FDI and left abductor pollicis brevis (APB).

In addition, CS patients showed a similar MEP increase in both muscles while control subjects showed a slight increase in APB and only immediately after PAS.

Homeostatic plasticity maintains the balance of plasticity in the nervous system at a stable level whereas depotentiation/de-depression abolishes synaptic plasticity that has just occurred in order to prevent ongoing learning. In the present study, we developed novel protocols to explore the reversal of LTP- and LTD-like effects in healthy conscious humans based on the recently developed theta burst form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS). The potentiation effect induced by intermittent TBS (iTBS) was completely erased by a short form of continuous TBS (cTBS150) given 1 min after iTBS, whereas the depressive effect of continuous TBS (cTBS) was successfully abolished by a short form of iTBS (iTBS150). The reversal was specific to the nature of the second protocol and was time dependent since it was less effective when the intervention was given 10 min after induction of plasticity. All these features are compatible with those of depotentiation and de-depression demonstrated in animal studies. The development of the present protocols would be helpful to study the physiology of the reversal of plasticity and learning and to probe the abnormal depotentiation/de-depression shown in animal models of neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease with dyskinesia, dystonia and Huntingon's disease).", "pages": "e111-3"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treats postpartum depression.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19288184", "authors": ["Garcia, KS", "Flynn, P", "Pierce, KJ", "Caudle, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Mirror movements (MMs) are unintended and unnecessary movements accompanying voluntary activity in homologous muscles on the opposite side of the body, particularly in distal arm muscles.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was also employed to clarify the causal contribution of frontal areas previously related to WM, to the PM process. The prospective task required the participant to respond whenever a word appeared which had been presented before the beginning of the task.

In the first two experiments, higher PM demand affected WM only at higher loads, but the PM load effect was independent of WM, showing asymmetrical behavioural effects. In the third experiment, single pulse TMS was applied to left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.

The effect was bilateral, since there was no difference between left and right stimulation sites.

In order to map somatosensory input into a spatiotopic representation, information about skin location must be integrated with proprioceptive information about body posture. We investigated the neural bases of this tactile remapping mechanism in humans by disrupting neural activity in the putative human homolog of the monkey ventral intraparietal area (hVIP), within the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC), which is thought to house external spatial representations. Participants judged the elevation of touches on their (unseen) forearm relative to touches on their face. Arm posture was passively changed along the vertical axis, so that elevation judgments required the use of an external reference frame. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the rPPC significantly impaired performance compared to a control site (vertex). Crucially, proprioceptive judgments of arm elevation or tactile localization on the skin remained unaffected by rPPC TMS. This selective disruption of tactile remapping suggests a distinct computational process dissociable from pure proprioceptive and somatosensory localization. Furthermore, this finding highlights the causal role of human PPC, putatively VIP, in remapping touch into external space.", "pages": "e111-3"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Hands on the future: facilitation of cortico-spinal hand-representation when reading the future tense of hand-related action verbs.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17680239", "authors": ["Candidi, M", "Leone-Fernandez, B", "Barber, HA", "Carreiras, M", "Aglioti, SM"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Much evidence suggests that restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder characterized by an unsuppressed response to sensory urges due to abnormalities in inhibitory pathways that specifically link sensory input and motor output.

SAI and LAI were determined using transcranial magnetic stimulation before and after 1 month of dopaminergic treatment in RLS patients. Ten na\u00efve patients with idiopathic RLS and ten healthy age-matched controls were recruited. Patients with secondary causes for RLS (e.g. renal failure, anaemia, low iron and ferritin) were excluded, as well as those with other sleep disorders. Untreated RLS patients demonstrated deficient SAI in the human motor cortex, which proved revertible toward normal values after dopaminergic treatment. We demonstrated an alteration of sensory-motor integration, which is normalized by dopaminergic treatment, in patients affected by RLS.

In order to investigate the action observation mechanisms, simple single joint intransitive movements have commonly been used. Still, how the observation of everyday movements which often are the prime target of rehabilitation affects the observer cortical excitability remains unclear. Using transcranial magnetic stimulations, we aimed at verifying if the observation of everyday movements made by the proximal or distal upper-limb produces effector-specific motor facilitation in proximal (arm) and distal (hand) muscles of healthy subjects. Results suggest that, similar to simple intransitive movements, observation of more complex everyday movements involving mainly the proximal or distal part of upper limb induces different patterns of motor facilitation across upper limb muscles (P=0.02). However, we observed large inter-individual variability in the strength of the effector-specific motor facilitation induced by action observation. Yet, subjects had similar types of response (strong or weak effector-specific effects) when watching proximal or distal movements indicating that the facilitation pattern was highly consistent within subjects (r=0.83-0.88, P<0.001). This suggests that some individuals are better than other at precisely mapping the observed movements on their motor repertoire and that this type of response holds for various types of everyday actions.", "pages": "e111-3"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "\"Everything is hard before it's easy\"--Thomas Fuller.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16215301", "authors": ["Attarian, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Bupropion is associated with a dose-related increased seizure risk.

Using the theta burst stimulation (TBS) and a delay discounting (DD) task, we investigated the potential role of right DLPFC in impulsive decision making defined by the rate of discounting delayed reward. Healthy right-handed volunteers underwent three stimulation sessions, intermittent TBS (iTBS), continuous TBS (cTBS), and sham. The steepness of the discount function (k-value), reaction time for choice and consistency were measured for each subjects. cTBS of the DLPFC reduced by 36.88 % the k-value of the DD task compared to sham condition. In contrast, iTBS did not affect impulsivity level. There were no changes neither in reaction time for choice nor consistency after either the iTBS or cTBS compared with the sham stimulation. These results demonstrate that cTBS-induced modulation of cortical excitability of the right DLPFC may affect and reduce impulsive decision making.
