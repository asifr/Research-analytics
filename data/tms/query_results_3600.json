They are homeostatically regulated, they are thought to be linked to learning and plasticity processes and, at the same time, they are associated with marked changes in cortical information processing. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density (hd) EEG we can measure slow waves, induce and measure plastic changes in the cerebral cortex and directly assess corticocortical information transmission. In this manuscript we review the results of recent experiments in which TMS with hd-EEG is used to demonstrate (i) a causal link between cortical plastic changes and sleep slow waves and (ii) a causal link between slow waves and the decreased ability of thalamocortical circuits to integrate information and to generate conscious experience during NREM sleep. The data presented here suggest a unifying mechanism linking slow waves, plasticity and cortical information integration; moreover, they suggest that TMS can be used as a nonpharmacological means to controllably induce slow waves in the human cerebral cortex.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Treating depression with a pulsating magnetic field.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10677593", "authors": ["Morrow, T"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Managed care (Langhorne, Pa.)", "abstract": "In visual suppression paradigms, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied approximately 90 ms after visual stimulus presentation over occipital visual areas can robustly interfere with visual perception, thereby most likely affecting feedback activity from higher areas (Amassian VE, Cracco RQ, Maccabee PJ, Cracco JB, Rudell A, Eberle L. 1989. Suppression of visual perception by magnetic coil stimulation of human occipital cortex. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 74:458-462.). It is speculated that the observed effects might stem primarily from the disruption of V1 activity. This hypothesis, although under debate, argues in favor of a special role of V1 in visual awareness. In this study, we combine TMS, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and calculation of the induced electric field to study the neural correlates of visual suppression. For parafoveal visual stimulation in the lower right half of the visual field, area V2d is shown to be the likely TMS target based on its anatomical location close to the skull surface. Furthermore, isolated stimulation of area V3 also results in robust visual suppression. Notably, V3 stimulation does not directly affect the feedback from higher visual areas that is relayed mainly via V2 to V1. These findings support the view that intact activity patterns in several early visual areas (rather than merely in V1) are likewise important for the perception of the stimulus.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "The cortical site of visual suppression by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10686179", "authors": ["Thielscher, A", "Reichenbach, A", "U\u011furbil, K", "Uluda\u011f, K"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "The ability to generate torque during a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) changes over the day.

We used magnetic stimulation of the cortex, electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve, electromyographic (EMG) recordings of muscle activity, and isometric torque measurements to evaluate the excitability of the motor cortex, the spinal cord, and the torque-generating capacity of the triceps surae (TS) muscles. We found that for morning people, cortical excitability was highest at 09:00, spinal excitability was highest at 21:00, and there were no significant differences in TS EMG or torque produced during MVCs over the day. In contrast, evening people showed parallel increases in cortical and spinal excitability over the day, and these were associated with increased TS EMG and MVC torque. There were no differences at the level of the muscle over the day between morning and evening people. We propose that the simultaneous increases in cortical and spinal excitability increased central nervous system drive to the muscles of evening people, thus increasing torque production over the day.

Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to explore multimodal interactions in the human motor system, namely at the level of the primary motor cortex (M1). Corticomotor excitability in M1 was measured while subjects perceived unimodal visual (V), unimodal auditory (A), or multimodal (V+A) stimuli of a simple hand action. In addition, incongruent multimodal stimuli were included, in which incongruent vision or sound was presented simultaneously with the auditory or visual action stimulus. A selective response increase was observed to the congruent multimodal stimulus as compared to the unimodal and incongruent multimodal stimuli. These findings speak in favour of 'shared' action representations in the human motor system that are evoked in a 'modality-dependent' way, i.e., they are elicited most robustly by the simultaneous presentation of congruent auditory and visual stimuli.

It can produce \"virtual lesions\" that interfere with activity in particular cortical areas at specific times during a task, or it can be used in a twin coil design to test the excitability of cortical projections to M1 at different times during a task. The former method has described how cortical structures such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) are important for specific aspects of reaching, grasping and lifting objects. In the latter method, a conditioning stimulus (CS) is first used to activate putative pathways to the motor cortex from, for example, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) or PMd, while a second, test stimulus (TS), delivered over the primary motor cortex a few ms later probes any changes in excitability that are produced by the input. Thus changes in the effectiveness of the conditioning pulse give an indication of how the excitability of the connection changes over time and during a specific task. Here we review studies describing the time course of operation of parallel intracortical circuits and cortico-cortical connections between the PMd, PMv, PPC and M1, thus demonstrating that functional interplay between these areas and the primary motor cortices is not fixed, but can change in a highly task-, condition- and time-dependent manner.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "196", "title": "Transient disruption of M1 during response planning impairs subsequent offline consolidation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17086200", "authors": ["Cohen, NR", "Cross, ES", "Wymbs, NF", "Grafton, ST"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Secondary E-fields have the greatest impact at areas in close proximity to each tissue layer. Throughout the head, the secondary E-field magnitudes typically range from 20% to 35% of the primary E-field's magnitude. The direction of the secondary E-field was generally in opposition to the primary E-field; however, for some locations, this was not the case (i.e. going from high to low conductivity tissues).

Four healthy subjects were studied in two separate sessions in a relaxed condition. rTMS and anodal rTES were delivered in trains to the left M1 over the motor area for evoking a MEP in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Changes in MEP size and latency during the course of the rTMS and rTES trains were compared. The possible effects of muscle activation on MEP amplitude were evaluated, and the possible effects of cutaneous trigeminal fibre activation on corticospinal excitability were excluded in a control experiment testing the MEP amplitude before and after supraorbital nerve repetitive electrical stimulation. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that rTES and rTMS trains elicited similar amplitude first MEPs and a similar magnitude MEP amplitude facilitation during the trains. rTES elicited a first MEP with a shorter latency than rTMS, without significant changes during the course of the train of stimuli. The MEP elicited by single-pulse TES delivered during muscle contraction had a smaller amplitude than the last MEP in the rTES trains. Repetitive supraorbital nerve stimulation left the conditioned MEP unchanged. Our results suggest that 5 Hz-rTES delivered in short trains increases cortical excitability and does so by acting on the excitatory interneurones probably through mechanisms similar to those underlying the rTMS-induced MEP facilitation.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Theta burst stimulation in the treatment of incapacitating tinnitus accompanied by severe depression.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16106657", "authors": ["Soekadar, SR", "Arfeller, C", "Rilk, A", "Plontke, SK", "Plewnia, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "CNS spectrums", "abstract": "A primary aim in the neuroscientific study of depression is to identify the brain areas involved in the pathogenesis of symptoms.

Inhibitory theta-burst TMS was applied to the left DLPFC (n = 10), to the right DLPFC (n = 10), or to an occipital cortical control site (n = 10) immediately after training on the serial reaction time task (SRTT). All groups were retested after eight daytime hours without sleep. TMS of either left or right DLPFC lead to skill improvements on the SRTT. Increase in skill was greater following right DLPFC stimulation than left DLPFC stimulation; there was no improvement in skill for the control group. Across all participants, free recall of the sequence was inversely related to the improvements in performance on the SRTT. These results support the hypothesis of interference between declarative and procedural consolidation processes and are discussed in the framework of the interactions between memory systems.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "106", "title": "Re-emergence of hand-muscle representations in human motor cortex after hand allograft.", "issue": "17", "pmid": "8342027", "authors": ["Vargas, CD", "Aball\u00e9a, A", "Rodrigues, EC", "Reilly, KT", "Mercier, C", "Petruzzo, P", "Dubernard, JM", "Sirigu, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "abstract": "Perception of the outside world results from integration of information simultaneously derived via multiple senses. Increasing evidence suggests that the neural underpinnings of multisensory integration extend into the early stages of sensory processing. In the present study, we investigated whether the superior temporal gyrus (STG), an auditory modality-specific area, is critical for processing tactile events. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the left STG and the left primary somatosensory cortex (SI) at different time intervals (60, 120, and 180 msec) during a tactile temporal discrimination task (Experiment 1) and a tactile spatial discrimination task (Experiment 2). Tactile temporal processing was disrupted when TMS was applied to SI at 60 msec after tactile presentation, confirming the modality specificity of this region. Crucially, TMS over STG also affected tactile temporal processing but at 180 msec delay. In both cases, the impairment was limited to the contralateral touches and was due to reduced perceptual sensitivity. In contrary, tactile spatial processing was impaired only by TMS over SI at 60-120 msec. These findings demonstrate the causal involvement of auditory areas in processing the duration of somatosensory events, suggesting that STG might play a supramodal role in temporal perception. Furthermore, the involvement of auditory cortex in somatosensory processing supports the view that multisensory integration occurs at an early stage of cortical processing.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Neural correlate of the contextual interference effect in motor learning: a kinematic analysis.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "5146491", "authors": ["Lin, CH", "Fisher, BE", "Wu, AD", "Ko, YA", "Lee, LY", "Winstein, CJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of motor behavior", "abstract": "Our aim was to determine whether ventilation and swallowing tasks can modify oropharyngeal cortical motor organisation.

Lesions to this area, either accidental or experimental, disrupt saccades and electrical stimulation elicits eye movements. Recently there has been increasing interest in the involvement of this area in visual processes, including in tasks where eye movements were either not required or were precluded. In addition to being involved in a range of visual tasks, evidence from visual search paradigms has suggested that this area might be important when the defining quality of the target is unpredictable or that it may be involved in priming. We investigated the role of FEF in a task requiring localisation of a target defined by colour, in which the target colour was either maintained or switched across trials. Disruption of performance was seen on the task when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered over the left FEF, specifically elevating response times on trials when the target and distracter colours were switched rather than affecting any benefit of repetition of the target attribute (priming). This result is consistent with altered modulation of extrastriate areas, consequently affecting the speed with which a switch of the target colour could be detected. This both offers an explanation for effects seen in unpredictable feature search and is consistent with other TMS and microstimulation studies showing that FEF modulates responses of extrastriate cortex.", "pages": "1761-70"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "Invasive cortical stimulation to promote recovery of function after stroke: a critical appraisal.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11050030", "authors": ["Plow, EB", "Carey, JR", "Nudo, RJ", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation is an interesting technique for non-invasively stimulating the brain in awake alert humans.

To investigate the basis of this variability, we performed extracellular recordings in the visual cortex following application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Our measurements of spiking and local field potential activity exhibit two types of response patterns which are characterized by the presence or absence of spontaneous discharge following stimulation. This variability can be partially explained by state-dependent effects, in which higher pre-TMS activity predicts larger post-TMS responses. These results reveal the possibility that variability in the neural response to TMS can be exploited to optimize the effects of stimulation.

Until now, several levels of genetic influences were examined, ranging from global heritability estimates down to the analysis of the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and variable number tandem repeats. In humans, the corticospinal motor system is essential to the acquisition of fine manual motor skills which require a finely tuned coordination of activity in distal forelimb muscles. Here we review recent brain mapping studies that have begun to explore the influence of functional genetic variation as well as mutations on function and structure of the human corticospinal motor system, and also the clinical implications of these studies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor hand area revealed a modulatory role of the common val66met polymorphism in the BDNF gene on corticospinal plasticity. Diffusion-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging has been employed to pinpoint subtle structural changes in corticospinal motor projections in individuals carrying a mutation in genes associated with motor neuron degeneration.

Herein, we present a case of a 54-year-old woman with incapacitating tinnitus that has significantly decreased after three cycles of 1-week treatment with continuous TBS to the temporo-parietal auditory association cortex. According to the Tinnitus Questionnaire, tinnitus intensity decreased from 84 points before to 59 points after treatment. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score dropped from 44 to 23 points.

Using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) this study showed that the primary motor cortex may play a role in motor adaptation of this sort. Subjects performed arm reaching movement trials in three phases: in a null force field (baseline), in a velocity-dependent force field (adaptation; 25 N s m(-1)) and once again in a null force field (de-adaptation). Active or sham tDCS was directed to the motor cortex representation of biceps brachii muscle during the adaptation phase of the motor learning protocol. During the adaptation phase, the global error in arm reaching (summed error from an ideal trajectory) was similar in both tDCS conditions. However, active tDCS induced a significantly greater global reaching (overshoot) error during the early stage of de-adaptation compared to the sham tDCS condition. The overshoot error may be representative of the development of a greater predictive movement to overcome the expected imposed force. An estimate of the predictive, initial movement trajectory (signed error in the first 150 ms of movement) was significantly augmented during the adaptation phase with active tDCS compared to sham tDCS. Furthermore, this increase was linearly related to the change of the overshoot summed error in the de-adaptation process.
