Magnetic stimulation had no detrimental effect on the performance of pop-out search, but did significantly increase reaction times on conjunction search when stimulation was applied over the right parietal cortex 100 msec after the onset of the visual display for trials when the target was present. Target absent reaction times were elevated when stimulation was applied 160 msec after array onset. Stimulation had no effect on the number of errors made. The results suggest that a sub-region of the right parietal lobe is important for conjunction search but not for pre-attentive pop-out. The result from target present trials is consistent with timing data from studies of single cells in monkeys and the hypothesis that parietal areas generate a signal that projects back to extrastriate visual areas to enhance the processing of features in a restricted part of the visual field. The timing of the effect indicates that transcranial stimulation disrupts the mechanisms underlying the focal attention necessary for feature binding in conjunction search. The effects of TMS on target absent trials are interpreted in terms of fronto-parietal connections and the role of frontal cortex in decision-making.

Fink). What is not yet known is which of these mechanisms is crucial for the psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. However, it is clear that the effects of ST tend to be relatively acute, and do not attack the deep-seated abnormalities that are the underlying causes of recurrences of affective disorders. This is corroborated by the fact that in animals, most of the effects of ECS on catecholamines and their receptors (and on receptors for benzodiazepines or neuropeptides such as TRH) tend to be relatively transient, and in most cases have been found to represent compensatory adaptations to the induced motor convulsions. However, recent preclinical data using attenuation, and clinical findings using reiterated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), suggest that it may not be necessary to provoke a clonic convulsion in order to achieve the beneficial psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. In rodents receiving stimulation to the cerebellar tonsil, seven daily subacute low-frequency sessions (stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes) produced clear improvement in clonic convulsions and in post-discharge thresholds, together with durable inhibition of convulsions when stimulation was resumed (Weiss et al., 1995). Stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes was more effective than stimulation at 10 or 20 Hz in attenuating convulsions. Although reiterated ECS also induced an anti-triggering effect, this dissipated rapidly over five days (Post et al., 1984). It is of great interest that recent publications have shown that rTMS at 10 or 20 Hz to the left frontal cortex, administered to patients suffering from refractory depression (George et al., 1995) or to patients (hospitalised or not) with milder degrees of depression (Pasquale-Leon et al., 1996), had a moderate or marked antidepressant effect. In these studies, rTMS showed few unwanted effects (other than mild pain in some patients, due to contraction of the temporal muscles); it did not induce motor convulsions, and did not, as such, appear to be associated with the memory loss described in subjective accounts or in preliminary neuropsychological tests (Little and Kimbrell et al., 1996). The optimal frequencies, durations and positions for rTMS to maximise its antidepressant effect still remain to be determined. However, the first controlled and open studies have tended to show that (because of the capacity of rapid magnetic fluxes to produce sub-convulsant electrical discharges that are relatively localised in the brain), rTMS may be found to be a clinically useful antidepressant model. This would suggest the possibility that some of the neurochemical changes induced by the clonic convulsions of ECS could be directly induced by stimulation at the very edge of the threshold (but still below it); this would open up the hope that one day these endogenous neurochemical processes could be identified and exploited in an optimal way for therapeutic purposes.", "pages": "538-42"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Mechanisms of central motor reorganization in pediatric hemiplegic patients.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9266555", "authors": ["Maegaki, Y", "Maeoka, Y", "Ishii, S", "Shiota, M", "Takeuchi, A", "Yoshino, K", "Takeshita, K"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Neuropediatrics", "abstract": "Twenty hemiplegic patients were studied with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

In patients with prenatal or birth lesion on BB and in all patients on APB, cortical maps of MEP amplitude of paretic and non-paretic sides showed similar distributions. There were no remarkable differences in mean latency between both sides, and correlation coefficients of MEP amplitude between both sides were high in these patients. In patients with postnatal lesion on BB, MEP maps of both sides showed different distributions, ipsilateral MEP latencies were delayed and correlation coefficients were low.

By contrast, magnetic fields pass almost without attenuation through the skull, and can induce secondary electrical currents in localized areas of the brain. Subconvulsive rTMS does not require seizure or general anesthetic, and does not affect memory. Recent studies suggest that rTMS has therapeutic potential for mood disorders, for which ECT is well established. rTMS is a new technology with the potential to treat some mental disorders currently treated with ECT, with fewer side effects.

Evoked motor responses (EMR) were studied in the electromyogram (EMG) of tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GM) and, for reference, abductor digiti minimi (AD) muscles by applying below-threshold magnetic stimuli during treadmill walking in healthy adults. Averages of 15 stimuli introduced randomly at each of 16 phases of the stride cycle were analysed. Phase-dependent amplitude modulation of EMR was present in TA and GM which did not always parallel the gait-associated modulation of the EMG activity. No variation of onset latency of the EMR was observed. The net modulatory response was calculated by comparing EMR amplitudes during gait with EMR amplitudes obtained (at corresponding background EMG activities) during tonic voluntary muscle contraction. Large net responses in both muscles occurred prior to or during phasic changes of EMG activity in the locomotor pattern. This facilitation of EMR was significantly higher in leg flexor than extensor muscles, with maxima in TA prior to and during late swing phase. A comparison of this facilitation of TA EMR prior to swing phase and prior to a phasic voluntary foot dorsiflexion revealed a similar onset but an increased amount of early facilitation in the gait condition. The modulated facilitation of EMR during locomotion could in part be explained by spinal effects which are different under dynamic and static motor conditions. However, we suggest that changes in corticospinal excitability during gait are also reflected in this facilitation. This suggestion is based on: (1) the similar onset yet dissimilar size of facilitatory effects in TA EMR prior to the swing phase of the stride cycle and during a voluntary dynamic activation, (2) the inverse variation of EMR and EMG amplitudes during this phase, and (3) the occurrence of this inversion at stimulation strengths below motor threshold (motor threshold was determined during weak tonic contraction and EMR were facilitated during gait).

Taking these findings as well as the results of positive magnetic resonance imaging into consideration, we concluded that the clinical symptom was due to a plaque of demyelinization in the nucleus of the facial nerve or in the proximal intramedullary course of facial fibres.", "pages": "538-42"}, {"volume": "755", "title": "Motor cortex involvement during choice reaction time: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in man.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7735884", "authors": ["Romaigu\u00e8re, P", "Possama\u00ef, CA", "Hasbroucq, T"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "1.

Stimulation of the medial plantar nerve only rarely produced similar effects. The possibility that a transcortical pathway contributes to these late reflex responses was investigated by combining the cutaneous stimulations and a transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex. 2. A significant facilitation of short-latency peaks in the post-stimulus time histogram of single tibialis anterior motor units evoked by the transcortical magnetic stimulation was observed in eight out of nine subjects following stimulation of the superficial peroneal or sural nerves at the latency of the long-latency reflex. In contrast such a facilitation was only rarely seen when the medial plantar nerve was stimulated. 3. With the same timing for the stimuli, the superficial peroneal and sural nerve stimulations also produced a significant increase in the short-latency, presumed monosynaptic, facilitation of the tibialis anterior H reflex produced by the brain stimulation. 4. Similar facilitatory effects of the cutaneous stimuli could not be demonstrated when the magnetic stimulation of the cortex was replaced with electrical stimulation, implying that cortical excitability is affected by a conditioning cutaneous stimulation. 5.

Although it is agreed that magnetic stimulation could be a useful tool for studying information processing in man, we argue that, because of the use of simple reaction time, the results reported so far are difficult to interpret within this theoretical framework. In the present paper, three experiments are reported. Six subjects participated in experiment 1 in which magnetic stimulation was delivered, at different times, during choice reaction time. The effects of the magnetic stimulation of the cortical area involved in the response (induced current passing forward over the motor representation of the responding hand), were compared to the effects of an electrical stimulation of the median nerve (H-reflex). In a first control experiment (experiment 2a; 5 subjects), the coil was placed over the ipsilateral motor cortex (induced current passing backward over the motor representation of the non-responding hand) thus minimizing the probability to excite the same neural nets as in the first experiment. In a second control experiment (experiment 2b; 4 subjects), the coil was placed a few centimeters away from the subject's scalp thus ensuring no stimulation of any neural nets. The results show that: (1) the noise and the smarting of the skin associated with the coil discharge produce an intersensory facilitation thereby shortening reaction time (experiment 2a), (2) actually, the noise produced by the stimulation is sufficient to produce such a facilitatory effect (experiment 2b), (3) a stimulation over the area at the origin of the motor command causes a reaction time delay which counteracts this intersensory facilitation effect (experiment 1), (4) in this latter case, the closer the stimulation to the actual overt response, the longer the delay and (5) there is no trace of correlation between the amplitude of the motor evoked potential and the reaction time change.", "pages": "538-42"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation during positron emission tomography: a new method for studying connectivity of the human cerebral cortex.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "8120805", "authors": ["Paus, T", "Jech, R", "Thompson, CJ", "Comeau, R", "Peters, T", "Evans, AC"], "year": "1997", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "We examined the influence of rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation on heart rate and blood pressure in 13 healthy volunteers.

A round coil was used for TMS, and the anode was located at the vertex for TES. The responses of 175 identified corticospinal axons (conduction velocities of 24-95 m/s) were recorded from the lateral corticospinal tract at the T12-L3 spinal level. A single magnetic or electrical stimulus could evoke an early spike corresponding to the direct (D) wave in surface recorded volleys and was termed a D response. In the same axon, up to four further spikes, termed indirect (I) responses, could also be evoked. At a given intensity of stimulation, D responses had clear thresholds and fixed latencies, whereas I responses were labile in both respects. For TMS and TES, the thresholds of both D and I responses were inversely correlated with axonal conduction velocity. For TMS, fast conducting axons (> 75 m/s) had lower thresholds for D responses, while more slowly conducting axons (< 55 m/s) had lower thresholds for I responses. Very few of the axons with a conduction velocity of < 40 m/s (three out of 23) gave a D response to TMS. For TES, the majority of axons had lower thresholds for D responses or a similar threshold for both D and I responses. At threshold, the latencies of D responses evoked by TMS and TES were consistent with activation within the cortex, while TES also excited some corticospinal axons deep to the cortex. At 2.5 times threshold for the D response, TMS still excited axons mostly within the cortex, but with TES the site of activation shifted by as much as 65 mm below the cortex (mode 20 mm). Intracellular responses were recorded in 23 plantar alpha motor neurons supplying intrinsic muscles of the foot. All showed monosynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) to both TMS and TES with no significant differences in the rise times of the evoked EPSPs. At threshold for a surface corticospinal volley, the average EPSP to TES began 0.5 ms earlier than that to TMS, and 1.0 ms earlier at 2.5 times this threshold.

These observations lead us to conclude as follows: (1) the patient's left hand clumsiness is probably due to the disturbance of kinesthesia, which is crucial to activate temporo-spatial patterns of complex hand and finger movements as well as to maintain long sequences of simple motor execution without vision; and (2) kinesthesia is a specific sensation that is presumably conveyed by the dorsal columns and could be selectively affected by a cervical cord lesion.", "pages": "538-42"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Coexisting peripheral nerve and cervical cord compression.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "2993087", "authors": ["Kaneko, K", "Kawai, S", "Taguchi, T", "Fuchigami, Y", "Shiraishi, G"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at stimulation strength of 1.5 times the resting motor threshold, a silent period (SP) of approximately 180 ms duration can be observed in surface EMG-registrations of tonically activated small hand muscles. This SP is believed to be generated cortically and can be prolonged in stroke patients, but it is not known whether a prolongation of the SP has any functional significance. In order to answer the question of whether enhanced cortical inhibition can contribute to pathophysiology of motor dysfunction we studied stroke patients with clearly prolonged SP durations in the first dorsal interosseus muscle (> 2 times that of the intact side), but with normal magnetically evoked motor potentials. Sixteen patients out of a cohort of 174 consecutive patients presenting with acute hemiparetic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Serial TMS investigations were performed for up to 2 years post-stroke. In all patients, the SP duration decreased in parallel with clinical improvement. In two patients, intermittent clinical deterioration was accompanied by an increase in the SP duration. In four patients, in addition to a markedly prolonged SP duration, the phenomenon of a complete inability to initiate voluntary muscle activity for several seconds, following TMS, could be observed in a number of trials ('motor arrest'). Detailed clinical analysis revealed that, in addition to hemiparesis, distinct motor disturbances in patients with SP prolongation could be observed. These motor disturbances resembled those of motor neglect and were characterized by motivationally dependent under-utilization of the affected arm, impairment of movement initiation, inability to maintain a constant force level and to scale forces, and impairment of individual finger movements. In 12 of the 16 patients at least one additional behavioural manifestation of neglect was present. We suggest that in stroke patients severe motor dysfunction may be caused by hyperactivity of cortical inhibitory interneurons rather than by direct lesions of descending motor tracts. Cortical hyperinhibition may, in turn, result from damage to any of a number of afferent pathways to the motor cortex which modulate local interneuronal activity.", "pages": "538-42"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Neuropsychological and neurophysiological consequences of partial callosotomy.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "479924", "authors": ["Woiciechowsky, C", "Vogel, S", "Meyer, BU", "Lehmann, R"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical sciences", "abstract": "A new method is presented for mapping the motor cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation in which the position of the stimulation coil on the scalp is measured using a 3D digitizer.

Relatively weak stimuli evoke a short-latency primary response via a presumably monosynaptic corticospinal path. This is followed by a silent period that is terminated by a second peak at a latency of 50-80 ms. The responses evoked in single motor units in flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) were recorded. Responses were elicited at the second-peak latency only in trials in which no primary response was elicited in that unit, and only when the stimulus was given during the first half of the interspike interval (ISI). When given during the second half of the ISI, the same stimulus evoked a primary response but no second peak response. Stronger stimuli suppressed the second peak by evoking a primary response in more trials. Having discharged at about 20 ms latency, the parent motoneurone was unable to discharge again at second-peak latency, 30-60 ms later. The response at second-peak latency was not modified by disengaging both FDP and the extensors of the distal interphalangeal joint. Hence, this response is not secondary to a stretch reflex provoked by activation of the finger extensors, nor is it the result of a cutaneous signal resulting from movement of the finger. The latencies suggest that the corticospinal volley evokes a beta-motoneurone-mediated twitch in FDP muscle spindles, which elicits an afferent volley that activates the motoneurone reflexly. The first 100 ms or so of the silent period is due to the realignment of the first post-stimulus spike in most trials to corticospinal latency; i.e. this is not necessarily the result of an inhibitory or disfacilitatory process.

The primary CNS action of ketamine appears to be a non-competitive block of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Although numerous other receptors (e.g., GABA, nicotinic acetylcholine, opiate, voltage-operated channels) have been reported to interact with ketamine, their role in inducing dissociative anaesthesia is still under discussion. In humans, characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after administration of ketamine are dose-dependent increases in delta, theta, and beta power. In equipotent doses S-(+)-ketamine induces similar EEG changes. However, in comparison to racemic ketamine and S-(+)-ketamine, R-(-)-ketamine does not suppress the EEG to the same extent. Former studies suggested that ketamine is a proconvulsive agent; however, recent studies have demonstrated anticonvulsive and even neuroprotective properties. In humans, low-dose ketamine has no influence on early cortical peaks of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). Larger doses induce increases in SEP amplitude while latencies are unchanged. Recent data indicate that analgesia induced by low-dose ketamine may be quantitated by specific pain-related SEP. Significant reductions of pain-induced cortical potentials may be correlated with subjective pain ratings. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (AEP) are not influenced by ketamine. Interestingly, in contrast to many other anaesthetics, middle-latency AEP were not altered by racemic and S-(+)-ketamine.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that 4-AP ameliorates central motor conduction deficits in individuals with SCI. Oral 4-AP (10 mg) was administered to 19 (n = 19) SCI subjects with stable neurological deficits. Their response to the drug was monitored using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) following transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex and various measures of segmental or peripheral reflex activity (F-waves, H-reflex, and M-response) recorded from lower limb muscles. The mean MEP amplitude in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (left) was significantly (p < .05) increased from x = .25 +/- .42 mV to x = .59 +/- 1.04 mV at 2 h after drug administration, and the cortical stimulation threshold was reduced (p < .05) by 5.8%. Similar results were obtained in all subjects exhibiting MEPs (n = 13) and in all muscles (n = 6) studied. These changes were maintained at 4 h postdrug. MEP latencies were reduced in all subjects who initially exhibited abnormally prolonged MEP latencies relative to control group (n = 13) values. F-wave, H-reflex, and M-response values (latency and amplitude) were not systematically altered by 4-AP, leading to the conclusion that it was central motor conduction that was enhanced. This interpretation was supported by observed reductions in central motor conduction time (CMCT) in the majority of SCI subjects from whom CMCT measurements were obtained, two of whom anecdotally reported improved motor control after 4-AP, and by increased MEP:M-wave amplitude ratios. The MEP:M-wave ratios indicated that the magnitude of the effect of 4-AP on motoneuron recruitment was not large, in absolute terms (<4% motoneuron pool), but was appreciable relative to the initial level of motoneuron recruitment. These results provide the first statistically significant, objective evidence of improved functioning of the neuromuscular system in chronically injured SCI subjects receiving 4-AP and suggest that the improvements are mediated through enhanced central conduction.

In experiment 1 (n = 10), the TMS was delivered either simultaneously with the warning signal or simultaneously with the response signal in two conditions of foreperiod duration: short (500 ms) and long (2500 ms). The peak amplitude of the motor evoked potentials diminished during the short foreperiod but not during the long foreperiod. Since RT was shorter when the foreperiod lasted 500 ms than when it lasted 2500 ms, this result suggests that the excitability of the cortico-spinal structures is minimal when the subject is optimally ready to react. In experiment 2 (n = 10), the time-course of this decrement was further explored. With this aim, only the short foreperiod was used and the TMS was delivered either 500 ms, 333 ms, 167 ms or 0 ms before the response signal. Cortico-spinal excitability decreased during the first 333 ms and then remained stable until the occurrence of the response signal.

We investigated 'physiological' fatigue in 21 patients with multiple sclerosis who complained of disabling fatigue by measuring the decline in strength during a 45 s maximal contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle. The results were compared with those from a control group of 19 healthy subjects. The strength of control subjects declined by approximately 20% during the contraction; twitch interpolation showed central drive remained almost maximal throughout, and therefore that the fatigue was peripheral in origin. Patients had normal baseline strength, but developed greater fatigue (approximately 45%), which was central in origin. In both cases, the decline in strength followed a roughly linear time course suggesting that the patients, like the normals, were trying to maintain a maximum voluntary effort. Evidence for frequency-dependent conduction block (FDCB) in the patients' central motor pathways was sought by measuring the EMG responses to single and paired transcranial magnetic stimuli. Fatigue had no effect on the latency or size of EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting that FDCB was unlikely to have occurred. This was supported by measurements of the maximum speed of voluntary muscle contraction; although the patients showed relatively slow speeds before exercise, the decline in speed after fatigue was no greater than in normal subjects. We conclude that excessive 'physiological' fatigue contributes to the symptom of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and is central in origin. However, since the degree of exercise-induced fatigue did not correlate with the baseline complaint of fatigue, other factors must also be operating to produce the full range of clinical symptoms. We found no conclusive evidence that central fatigue is related to increased dysfunction in the primary central motor pathways and no evidence that FDCB is the pathophysiological mechanism.

The MEP amplitudes increased and cortical representation areas for the paretic biceps by TMS were enlarged temporarily during recovery. They regressed in patient 1 and MEPs were not evoked at all in patient 2 after recovery. Conversely, MEPs were obtained by TMS of the affected hemisphere after recovery in both patients. These data indicate that ipsilateral motor pathways play a role in recovery from hemiplegia, especially at the beginning, and become inactivated when the contralateral motor pathways recover.", "pages": "538-42"}, {"volume": "144", "title": "Transcallosal inhibition in cortical and subcortical cerebral vascular lesions.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "3116913", "authors": ["Boroojerdi, B", "Diefenbach, K", "Ferbert, A"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "The effect of the glutamate antagonist riluzole on excitatory and inhibitory phenomena in the human motor system was studied by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral electrical nerve stimulation.

As these new methods become available, it is important to understand their relative advantages and liabilities, as well as how the information gained compares across different methods. A current and future trend in neurobiological studies as well as presurgical planning is to combine information from different imaging techniques. Multi-modal integration may perhaps give more powerful information than each modality alone, especially when one of the methods is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with its ability to non-invasively activate the brain. As an initial venture in cross comparing new imaging methods, we performed the following 2 studies, locating motor cortex with echoplanar BOLD fMRI and TMS.

Thus, the site of facial nerve activation with TMS is proximal to or within the site of the lesion in Bell's palsy. To evaluate the prognostic capability of TMS in unilateral Bell's palsy we examined 137 patients with this method, and compared the results with electroneuronography (ENoG). Within 0-4 days from the onset of palsy, the patients with elicitable TMS responses recovered better than those in whom TMS responses were not elicitable. If TMS was performed 5-9 days or 10-28 days after the onset of palsy, it did not provide any prognostic information. Based on amplitude side-to-side differences, ENoG did not contribute prognostic information during the first 9 days from the onset of palsy. Later on, 10-28 days after the onset of palsy, ENoG showed an increased capability to discriminate the patients with poor prognosis.

The threshold (3 cases) and CMCT (4 cases) were abnormal or asymmetric by stimulation of the motor cortex contralateral to the impaired hemicerebellum. The follow-up study in 2 patients revealed electrophysiological improvement closely related to clinical cerebellar recovery rate. CMCT was significantly longer by cortex stimulation contralateral to the impaired hemicerebellum than by ipsilateral stimulation. Prolonged CMCT was significantly correlated with the rated severity of cerebellar signs. Increased threshold may be due to depressed facilitating action of the deep cerebellar nuclei on contralateral motor cortex. Abnormal CMCT might result in reduced size and increased dispersion of the efferent volleys. Recovery of electrophysiological results could represent in part true potentially reversible functional deficit.
