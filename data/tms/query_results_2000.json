In the present study, we explored this question by comparing the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over either left or right motor cortex (M1) on motor skill learning in either hand, using a tDCS montage to better isolate stimulation to one hemisphere. Results were compared with those previously found with a montage more commonly used in the field. Six groups trained for three sessions on a visually guided sequential pinch force modulation task with their right or left hand and received right M1, left M1, or sham tDCS. A linear mixed-model analysis for motor skill showed a significant main effect for stimulation group (left M1, right M1, sham) but not for hand (right, left) or their interaction. Left M1 tDCS induced significantly greater skill learning than sham when hand data were combined, a result consistent not only with the hypothesized left hemisphere specialization for motor skill learning but also with possible increased left M1 responsiveness to tDCS. The unihemispheric montage effect size was one-half that of the more common montage, and subsequent power analysis indicated that 75 subjects per group would be needed to detect differences seen with only 12 subjects with the customary bihemispheric montage.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals attentional feedback to area V1 during serial visual search.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "10678696", "authors": ["Dugu\u00e9, L", "Marque, P", "VanRullen, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Visual search tasks have been used to understand how, where and when attention influences visual processing. Current theories suggest the involvement of a high-level \"saliency map\" that selects a candidate location to focus attentional resources. For a parallel (or \"pop-out\") task, the first chosen location is systematically the target, but for a serial (or \"difficult\") task, the system may cycle on a few distractors before finally focusing on the target. This implies that attentional effects upon early visual areas, involving feedback from higher areas, should be visible at longer latencies during serial search. A previous study from Juan & Walsh (2003) had used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to support this conclusion; however, only a few post-stimulus delays were compared, and no control TMS location was used. Here we applied TMS double-pulses (sub-threshold) to induce a transient inhibition of area V1 at every post-stimulus delay between 100 ms and 500 ms (50 ms steps). The search array was presented either at the location affected by the TMS pulses (previously identified by applying several pulses at supra-threshold intensity to induce phosphene perception), or in the opposite hemifield, which served as a retinotopically-defined control location. Two search tasks were used: a parallel (+ among Ls) and a serial one (T among Ls). TMS specifically impaired the serial, but not the parallel search. We highlight an involvement of V1 in serial search 300 ms after the onset; conversely, V1 did not contribute to parallel search at delays beyond 100 ms. This study supports the idea that serial search differs from parallel search by the presence of additional cycles of a select-and-focus iterative loop between V1 and higher-level areas.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Modulation of a fronto-parietal network in event-based prospective memory: an rTMS study.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "10680571", "authors": ["Bisiacchi, PS", "Cona, G", "Schiff, S", "Basso, D"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Event-based prospective memory (PM) is a multi-component process that requires remembering the delayed execution of an intended action in response to a pre-specified PM cue, while being actively engaged in an ongoing task.

In the present study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to investigate the causal involvement of frontal and parietal areas in different stages of the PM process (in particular, target checking and intention retrieval), and to determine the specific contribution of these regions to PM performance.

Therefore, in the experiments described here, we used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to test hypotheses regarding the roles of PMd both contralateral and ipsilateral to the reaching arm in men and in women. Inhibitory cTBS of the ipsilateral PMd did not have a significant effect on reaction time in either men or women. However, cTBS of the contralateral PMd resulted in a slowed mean reaction time in men but not in women. Movement times were unaffected by stimulation applied to either hemisphere. These results suggest the presence of sex differences in processing within the left PMd during visually guided reaching movements using the right arm. Further, when taken together, the results suggest that ipsilateral PMd activity in women may not be functionally necessary for reaching movements. Rather, this ipsilateral activity may provide a protective redundancy that can compensate for decreased activity from the contralateral PMd. The observation of sex differences in reaction times but not in movement times following cTBS to the contralateral hemisphere suggests that these sex differences are more strongly associated with movement planning than with motor execution.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "CSF tau levels influence cortical plasticity in Alzheimer's disease patients.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10882792", "authors": ["Koch, G", "Esposito, Z", "Kusayanagi, H", "Monteleone, F", "Codec\u00e1, C", "Di Lorenzo, F", "Caltagirone, C", "Bernardi, G", "Martorana, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration, reduced levels of neurotransmitters, and altered forms of synaptic plasticity.

To determine whether this reduction depends on the repetitive activation of the motoneurones, responses to TMS (motor evoked potentials, MEPs) and to cervicomedullary stimulation (cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials, CMEPs) were tested during a sustained submaximal contraction at a constant level of electromyographic activity (EMG). In such a contraction, some motoneurones are repetitively activated whereas others are not active. On four visits, eight subjects performed a 10 min maintained-EMG elbow flexor contraction of 25% maximum. Test stimuli were delivered with and without conditioning by TMS given 100 ms prior. Test responses were MEPs or CMEPs (two visits each, small responses evoked by weak stimuli on one visit and large responses on the other). During the sustained contraction, unconditioned CMEPs decreased \u223c20% whereas conditioned CMEPs decreased \u223c75 and 30% with weak and strong stimuli, respectively. Conditioned MEPs were reduced to the same extent as CMEPs of the same size. The data reveal a novel decrease in motoneurone excitability during a submaximal contraction if EMG is maintained. Further, the much greater reduction of conditioned than unconditioned CMEPs shows the critical influence of voluntary drive on motoneurone responsiveness. Strong test stimuli attenuate the reduction of conditioned CMEPs which indicates that low-threshold motoneurones active in the contraction are most affected. The equivalent reduction of conditioned MEPs and CMEPs suggests that, similar to findings with a sustained MVC, impaired motoneurone responsiveness rather than intracortical inhibition is responsible for the fatigue-related impairment of the MEP during a sustained submaximal contraction.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Commentary on Kratz et Al \"seizure in a nonpredisposed individual induced by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation\".", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12205165", "authors": ["Alonso-Alonso, M", "Chang, B", "Press, DZ", "Rotenberg, A", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation-motor evoked potential (TMS-MEP) test is one of the electrophysiological examination methods to evaluate the function of central nervous system.

Although shifts on focal brain excitability have been proposed to explain the clinical effects of tDCS, how tDCS-induced functional changes influence cortical interneurones is still largely unknown. The assessment of short latency afferent inhibition (SLAI) of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), provides the opportunity to test non-invasively interneuronal cholinergic circuits in the human motor cortex. The aim of the present study was to assess whether anodal tDCS can modulate interneuronal circuits involved in SLAI. Resting motor threshold (RMT), amplitude of unconditioned MEPs and SLAI were assessed in the dominant hemisphere of 12 healthy subjects (aged 21-37) before and after anodal tDCS (primary motor cortex, 13min, 1mA). SLAI was assessed delivering electrical conditioning stimuli to the median nerve at the wrist prior to test TMS given at the interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2ms. Whereas RMT and the amplitude of unconditioned MEPs did not change after anodal tDCS, SLAI significantly increased. In conclusion, anodal tDCS-induced effects depend also on the modulation of cortical interneuronal circuits. The enhancement of cortical cholinergic activity assessed by SLAI could be an important mechanism explaining anodal tDCS action in several pathological conditions.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Response training shortens visuo-motor related time in athletes.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "2860322", "authors": ["Yotani, K", "Tamaki, H", "Yuki, A", "Kirimoto, H", "Kitada, K", "Ogita, F", "Takekura, H"], "year": "2011", "journal": "International journal of sports medicine", "abstract": "Long-term effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been associated with neuroplasticity, but most physiological studies have evaluated only the immediate effects of the stimulation on neurochemical markers.

The first aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the long-term effects of high- and low-frequency rTMS on the markers of neuroplasticity such as BDNF and GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptor. The second aim was to assess whether these effects depend on spontaneous neural activity, by comparing the neurochemical alterations induced by rTMS in anesthetized and awake rats. Ten daily sessions of high- or low-frequency rTMS were applied over the rat brain, and 3 d later, levels of BDNF, GluR1, and phosphorylated GluR1 were assessed in the hippocampus, prelimbic cortex, and striatum. We found that high-frequency stimulation induced a profound effect on neuroplasticity markers; increasing them in awake animals while decreasing them in anesthetized animals. In contrast, low-frequency stimulation did not induce significant long-term effects on these markers in either state.

It is known that the antagonist/inverse agonist of CB1 receptors Rimonabant penetrates the blood-brain barrier and produces a broad range of central psychoactive effects in humans. Based on the occurrence of central effects in humans treated with Rimonabant and on the location of CB1 receptors, we hypothesized that the application of Rimonabant can also affect the motor system. We tested the effects of a single dose of 20mg of Rimonabant on the excitability of motor cortex and of spinal motor neurons in order to detect a possible drug action on motor system at cortical and spinal levels.

Single and paired pulse TMS and TES were used to assess a number of parameters of cortical inhibition and cortical excitability as well as of the excitability of spinal motor neurons. We demonstrated that a single oral dose of 20mg of Rimonabant can increase motor system excitability at cortical and spinal levels. This opens new avenues to test the CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists for the treatment of a number of neurological dysfunctions in which can be useful to increase the excitability levels of motor system.

When incorporating TMS paradigms in research studies, methodologic considerations include technical aspects of TMS, cohort selection and confounding factors, and subject safety. Available evidence suggests benefits of TMS alone or in combination with neurophysiologic and neuroimaging methods, including positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional near infrared spectroscopy, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography, to explore neocortical function.

Pretreatment with ketamine (1\u00a0\u03bcM) potentiated, while pretreatment with lithium (2\u00a0mM) attenuated this cellular response to repetitive magnetic stimulation.

Twitch force resultant vectors and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by TMS were measured before and after single sessions of strength training involving the forearm muscles.

There were no large or consistent changes in the direction of twitches evoked by motor nerve stimulation for any of the three training protocols.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to track changes in short-latency intracortical inhibition, a measure of excitability of GABA(A) -ergic corticocortical connections and long-term potentiation-like synaptic plasticity (as a response to paired associative stimulation). Deep brain stimulation remained on for the duration of the study. Prior to surgery, inhibition was reduced and plasticity increased in patients compared with healthy controls. Following surgery and commencement of deep brain stimulation, short-latency intracortical inhibition increased toward normal levels over the following months with the same monotonic time course as the patients' clinical benefit. In contrast, synaptic plasticity changed rapidly, following a nonmonotonic time course: it was absent early (1 month) after surgery, and then over the following months increased toward levels observed in healthy individuals. We postulate that before surgery preexisting high levels of plasticity form strong memories of dystonic movement patterns. When deep brain stimulation is turned on, it disrupts abnormal basal ganglia signals, resulting in the absent response to paired associative stimulation at 1 month.

To address this issue, we recorded I-waves in two patients with implanted cervical epidural electrodes and investigated how SICI and ICF changed I-waves in the presence of LICI. SICI alone reduced late I-waves but in the presence of LICI, neither the I-waves nor the MEP were further inhibited by SICI. ICF alone increased MEP amplitude but the I-waves were not facilitated. There was no change of ICF in the presence of LICI compared with ICF alone.

Importantly, however, there is no clear consensus on how different subregions within the PPC contribute to the programming and online control of reaching. In the current study, we investigated the role of the inferior (IPL) and superior (SPL) parietal lobules in reach programming using MRI-guided event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Specifically, we applied triple-pulse (tp) TMS to either the left IPL or the left SPL at different time points during reaching movements either at target onset (programming) or at movement onset (online control) while participants (n=16) made pointing movements to targets in the periphery without visual feedback of the moving hand.

Recent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have demonstrated a muscle-specific facilitation of the observer's motor system for force requirement and type of grip during grasping observation. However, whether similar fine-tuned muscle-specificity occurs even during imagination, when subjects are free to select the most convenient grip configuration, is still unknown. Here we applied TMS over the primary motor cortex and measured the corticospinal excitability (MEP) in three muscles (FDI, ADM and FDS) while subjects imagined grasping spheres of different dimensions and materials. This range of object weights and sizes (diameters) allowed subjects to freely imagine the most suitable grip configuration among several possibilities. Activation measured during grasping imagination has been also compared to that obtained during real execution (EMG recorded from the same muscles). We found that during imagination of grasping small objects, the FDI muscle was more active than the ADM and the FDS, whereas the opposite pattern was found for big objects. Imagination of medium size objects, instead, required an equal involvement of the three muscles. The same pattern was observed when subjects were asked to perform the action. This suggests that during imagination, the cortico-spinal system is modulated in a muscle-specific/grip-specific way, as if the action would be really performed. However, when force was required (i.e., for the aluminum objects), the motor activation obtained during action execution was more fine-tuned to object dimensions than the facilitation recorded during imagination, suggesting a separate control of force production.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Brain oscillations and frequency-dependent modulation of cortical excitability.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19788568", "authors": ["Schutter, DJ", "Hortensius, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) trials - investigating either non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions - have shown mixed results.

We performed a systematic review for randomized, controlled MDD trials whose intervention was transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in MEDLINE and other databases from April 2002 to April 2008. We created an unstructured checklist based on CONSORT guidelines to extract items such as power analysis, sham method, blinding assessment, allocation concealment, operational criteria used for MDD, definition of refractory depression and primary study hypotheses. Thirty-one studies were included. We found that the main methodological issues can be divided in to three groups: (1) issues related to phase II/small trials, (2) issues related to MDD trials and, (3) specific issues of NIBS studies. Taken together, they can threaten study validity and lead to inconclusive results. Feasible solutions include: estimating the sample size a priori; measuring the degree of refractoriness of the subjects; specifying the primary hypothesis and statistical tests; controlling predictor variables through stratification randomization methods or using strict eligibility criteria; adjusting the study design to the target population; using adaptive designs and exploring NIBS efficacy employing biological markers.

Therefore, it should receive signals related to reward. Pathways from reward centers to motor cortex exist in primates. Previously, we showed that gamma aminobutyric acid-A-mediated inhibition in the motor cortex, measured by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation, changes with expectation and uncertainty of money rewards generated by a slot machine simulation. We examined the role of dopamine in this phenomenon by testing 13 mildly affected patients with Parkinson's disease, off and on dopaminergic medications, and 13 healthy, age-matched controls. Consistent with a dopaminergic mechanism, reward expectation or predictability modulated the response to paired transcranial magnetic stimulation in controls, but not in unmedicated patients. A single dose of pramipexole restored this effect of reward, mainly by increasing the paired transcranial magnetic stimulation response amplitude during low expectation. Levodopa produced no such effect. Both pramipexole and levodopa increased risk-taking behavior on the Iowa Gambling Task. However, pramipexole increased risk-taking behavior more in patients showing lower paired transcranial magnetic stimulation response amplitude during low expectation. These results provide evidence that modulation of motor cortex inhibition by reward is mediated by dopamine signaling and that the physiological state of the motor cortex changes with risk-taking tendency in patients on pramipexole. The cortical response to reward expectation may represent an endophenotype for risk-taking behavior in patients on agonist treatment.", "pages": "1194-201"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Improving working memory: the effect of combining cognitive activity and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19886110", "authors": ["Andrews, SC", "Hoy, KE", "Enticott, PG", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Studies of embodied cognition have demonstrated the engagement of the motor system when people process action-related words and concepts.

Given the differences in methodology and modality, we re-examined this issue, comparing conditions in which participants either read or listened to the same set of action words. In separate blocks of trials, participants were presented with lists of words in the visual and auditory modality, and a TMS pulse was applied over left motor cortex, either 150 or 300\u00a0ms after the word onset.

However, this effect was only observed when the words were presented visually; no changes in MEPs were found when the words were presented auditorily.

The aim of the present experiments was to test how well responsiveness to brain-stimulation protocols and behavioural motor learning correlate with each other in a sample of 21 healthy volunteers. We also examined whether any of these measures were influenced by the presence of a Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene since this is another factor that has been suggested to be able to predict response to tests of synaptic plasticity. In 3 different experimental sessions, volunteers underwent 5-Hz rTMS, intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and a motor learning task. Blood samples were collected from each subject for BDNF genotyping. As expected, both 5-Hz rTMS and iTBS significantly facilitated MEPs. Similarly, as expected, kinematic variables of finger movement significantly improved during the motor learning task. Although there was a significant correlation between the effect of iTBS and 5-Hz rTMS, there was no relationship in each subject between the amount of TMS-induced plasticity and the increase in kinematic variables during motor learning. Val66Val and Val66Met carriers did not differ in their response to any of the protocols. The present results emphasise that although some TMS measures of cortical plasticity may correlate with each other, they may not always relate directly to measures of behavioural learning. Similarly, presence of the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism also does not reliably predict responsiveness in small groups of individuals.

We previously found that high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (hf-rTMS) can revert these facilitatory effects likely restoring the activity of inhibitory circuits. Here, we studied the effects of LD and rTMS on habituation of visual evoked potentials (VEPs). The hypothesis was that if the inhibitory circuits have a role in habituation, then LD that downregulates GABA circuits, should impair habituation that in turn should be restored by hf-rTMS. Fifteen healthy subjects underwent VEPs recording in baseline (without LD), in LD alone (without rTMS), in LD and 1\u00a0Hz rTMS and in LD and 10\u00a0Hz rTMS. Habituation observed in baseline (without LD) was significantly impaired after LD; 10\u00a0Hz but not 1\u00a0Hz rTMS was able to restore normal habituation phenomena. VEPs habituation is impaired by LD but it could be restored if hf-rTMS is given during LD. As LD acts reducing GABA circuits activity and hf-rTMS likely upregulates such circuits, these data give support to the hypothesis that cortical inhibition can play a relevant role in mechanisms underlying habituation.", "pages": "1194-201"}]
