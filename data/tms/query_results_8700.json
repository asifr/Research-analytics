More than 100 magnetic stimuli were delivered over the scalp during minimal muscle contraction. The occurrence of motor unit discharges was plotted in a peristimulus time histogram. An increase in discharge probability at latencies of 20-30 msec, that represents monosynaptic activation (primary peak) was found in normal units. Motor units from ALS patients with short disease durations had significantly increased discharge probabilities in the primary peak (P < 0.001). Motor units from 4 ALS patients with upper motor neuron signs showed double primary peaks: an initial synchronized peak followed by a dispersed peak.

This paper describes the effects of subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation on the F-waves evoked in hand and foot muscles. In the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, the F-wave was significantly enhanced when the cortical stimulus was given with a delay corresponding approximately to the expected time of collision, i.e., the difference between the mean latency of the F-wave and the mean latency of the motor evoked potential. A second, usually larger facilitatory phase follows the first phase after 2-3 msec, and later peaks of enhancement often occurred. After the enhancement periods, a significant inhibition of the F-wave was usually observed. In the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, the first facilitatory phase was observed some milliseconds earlier than expected in 4 of 5 subjects, and the inhibitory phase was less pronounced. We argue that the sequential arrival of I-waves at the spinal segment could be responsible for the changes observed in the F-wave recorded from the small hand muscle. In the foot muscle, anatomical and technical factors could contribute to the generation of a D-wave. The strong inhibition observed in the F-wave recorded from the hand muscle is likely to be due to the arrival on alpha-motoneurons of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) generated by the cortical stimulus.

The intensity of the conditioning stimulus was subthreshold (80%) at short, and suprathreshold (150%) at long intervals. In addition, the silent period following a single magnetic shock given at 150% of threshold was measured. With short interstimulus intervals, no significant difference between patients and normal subjects could be detected. With long interstimulus intervals, the test response was significantly more inhibited in patients than in normal subjects.

This alteration could be partially reverted in dopaminergic therapy. In conclusion, the responsiveness of motor cortices to suprathreshold magnetic stimuli delivered after the end of the silent period is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease, possibly due to prolonged activity in intracortical inhibitory circuits.

This effect was especially marked when TMS was applied parietally. TMS never influenced a saccade in flight. Simulations of predictive experimental saccades that were impaired through TMS of the frontal or parietal cortex demonstrated especially that the dynamics of small saccades were markedly influenced, resulting in a significant decrease in acceleration and amplitude, or an almost complete inhibition.

Efferent spinal cord potentials evoked by TCMS consisted of a 1 st component of high amplitude and short latency and a later polyphasic component with prolonged latency.

It is, however, unknown as to how an individual motoneurone (MN) contributes to the SP observed in the surface EMG. The present investigation was conducted to investigate inhibitory phenomena at the level of individual motor units. It demonstrates that the duration of the SP in single motor units is inhomogeneously distributed within the pool of active MNs. At various stimulation strengths, SP durations in single motor units can be similar or longer when compared to that observable in surface EMG records. In some motor units, which show low thresholds for early excitation and appearance of the SP, durations of SP can exceed 1000 msec. The length of suppression of spontaneous MN firing is maximal at stimulus intensities a little higher than those required for an early excitatory response. Although in general thresholds for early excitation and appearance of SPs are similar, at threshold stimulation in a number of trials inhibitory effects on the firing of voluntarily activated motoneurones were present, even in the absence of early excitations. This proves the independent nature of inhibitory as opposed to excitatory effects induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation. An SP in the absence of early excitation underlines its cortical origin. Inhibition and excitation of single MNs were maximal over the same small scalp area.

The variability of amplitude of these components was high (S.D.s of 13-50%), but the variability of latency was low (S.D.s of 2-3%). Eighteen I waves were recorded in 6 of the subjects. Their variability from trial to trial was similar to that of the components of the complex D wave. It is argued that there would be greater trial-to-trial variability of the corticospinal volley in the awake state, particularly when the stimulus was magnetic rather than electrical. Explanations for changes in the compound muscle action potential produced by transcranial stimulation, electrical or magnetic, must take into account that a constant stimulus does not evoke an identical descending volley.", "pages": "42-7"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "[Excitability of motor cortex with transcranial magnetic double stimulation in the intact man].", "issue": "9", "pmid": "2489409", "authors": ["Yoshino, A", "Yokota, T"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Rinsho byori.

The main features of the method introduced were: (i) use of the recharging time of the magnetic stimulator for response recording to the electrical stimulus, (ii) use of specific stimulus timing with respect to the motor unit discharges, and (iii) on-line display with statistical testing of the response functions allowing to stop stimulus application, if the responses to both types of stimuli had reached statistical significance.

In normal subjects and patients with facial palsy, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of the orbicularis oris muscle elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were compared with CMAPs elicited by electrical stimulation at a peripheral site of the stylomastoid foramen. This technique is similar to electroneurography (ENoG) and is regularly used in our department. In normal subjects, the latency of magnetically evoked CMAPs was longer (1.0ms, SD 0.39ms) than that of CMAPs evoked by electrical stimulation. There were two categories of patients; the first group consisted of patients who visited our hospital within 2 weeks after palsy onset with a record of electrically evoked CMAPs (ENoG) and magnetically evoked CMAPs, the second group consisted of all others. The first group was then divided into four subgroups based on minimal ENoG values obtained within 2 weeks after the onset of palsy. In patients, ENoG values declined until the seventh day after palsy onset, and then plateaued. However, the amplitude ratio of magnetically evoked CMAPs between the affected side and normal side showed no tendency to deline until the seventh day after palsy onset. Thus, whether magnetically evoked CMAPs could be recorded must be discussed in relation to the prognosis of facial palsy. The patients in whom magnetically evoked CMAPs could be recorded within the seven days after the onset of palsy were classified into a group in which the minimal ENoG value was greater than 20%. These patients recovered almost 2 months after the onset of palsy, and were significantly better than the recovery rates of those patients in whom magnetically evoked CMAPs could not be recorded. The site at which the facial nerve is magnetically stimulated remains controversial. In patients with peripheral facial palsy, recovery of the stapedial reflex, blink reflex and magnetically evoked CMAPs were examined to investigate the site of magnetic stimulation. From the clinical perspective, the facial nerve is thought to be magnetically stimulated near the meatal foramen that Fisch reported the site of damage in Bell's palsy.

Stimuli, directed at the hand area of the motor cortex, were delivered at eight defined points during the task: during reach, at grip closure, during object manipulation, during the parallel isometric increase in grip and load forces, during the lifting movement, and while the object was held in air. The amplitudes of short-latency EMG responses evoked by TMS in six arm and hand muscles showed a striking modulation across the different phases of the task. This modulation may well reflect phasic changes in corticospinal excitability because: (1) it did not simply reflect phasic changes in muscular activity associated with task performance, (2) it could vary inversely with the amplitude of the background EMG, and (3) it was only obtained with weak TMS intensities, below threshold for evoking responses in hand muscles of the relaxed subject. Our results suggest that the cortical representations of extrinsic hand muscles, which act to orientate the hand and finger tips, were subjected to a strong excitatory drive throughout the reach. This drive was also observed for brachioradialis and anterior deltoid, which contribute to transport of the hand. In contrast, the intrinsic hand muscles appear to receive their strongest cortical input as the digits closed around the object, and just after the subject first touched the object at the onset of manipulation. The isometric parallel increase in load and grip forces necessary to lift the object, which is normally triggered by tactile contact, was delayed by TMS delivered late during the reach.

Over the course of 5 days, as subjects learned the one-handed, five-finger exercise through daily 2-h manual practice sessions, the cortical motor areas targeting the long finger flexor and extensor muscles enlarged, and their activation threshold decreased. Such changes were limited to the cortical representation of the hand used in the exercise.
