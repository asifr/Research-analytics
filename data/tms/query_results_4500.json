The third part will explore our current understanding of motor memory processing, describe the neural structures that subserve motor memory consolidation, and discuss the current literature related to memory reconsolidation in healthy adults.

Single- and paired-pulse (interstimulus intervals, ISIs; 3 ms and 12 ms) transcranial magnetic stimulations of the left M1 were applied to elicit motor evoked potential (MEP) in the right first dorsal interosseous (Rt-FDI) muscle during voluntary contractions (10% and 30% maximum voluntary contraction) of the left FDI (Lt-FDI) muscle. F-waves of Rt-FDI muscle were recorded under these left index-finger conditions for ensuring that the excitability changes occur at the supraspinal level. MEPs were also recorded during motor imagery of the left index-finger abduction instead of overt movement. The results showed that, in single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm, MEPs in Rt-FDI muscle were markedly enhanced during voluntary contractions of Lt-FDI muscle compared with the complete resting state. In paired-pulse TMS paradigm, the short intracortical inhibition was significantly reduced in proportion to increments of the ipsilateral muscle contraction, whereas the intracortical facilitation had no change. F-wave of Rt-FDI muscle was unchanged under these conditions, while MEP in Rt-FDI muscle was also enhanced during motor imagery of the left index-finger abduction. Based on the present results, it is suggested that the intracortical inhibitory neural circuits may be modulated in the transition from rest to activity of the ipsilateral homonymous muscle.

To this end, we applied a comprehensive input-output analysis after fitting the experimental results to a sigmoidal function. Twenty-six healthy subjects participated in the experiments. Repetitive TMS was applied either over M1 or PMC at 1 Hz (LF) for 30 min (1,800 pulses) or at 20 Hz (HF) for 20 min (1,600 pulses). In the HF condition, the TMS intensity was set to 90% (HF(90)) of the FDI's resting motor threshold (RMT). In the LF condition, the TMS intensity was set to either 90% (LF(90)) or 115% (LF(115)) of the RMT. The FDI input/output (I/O) curve was measured on both sides of the body before rTMS (the Pre session) and then during two Post sessions. For each subject, the I/O curves (i.e., the integral of the FDI motor-evoked potential (MEP) vs. stimulus intensity) were fitted using a Boltzmann sigmoidal function. The graph's maximum slope, S (50) and plateau value were then compared between Pre and Post sessions. LF(115) over M1 increased the slope of the FDI I/O curve but did not change the S (50) and plateau value. This also suggested an increase in the RMT. HF(90) led to a more complex effect, with an increase in the slope and a decrease in the S (50) and plateau value. We did not see a cross effect on the homologous FDI corticospinal pathway, and only PMC LF(90) had an effect on ipsilateral corticospinal excitability. Our results suggest that rTMS may exert a more complex influence on cortical network excitability than is usually reported (i.e. simple inhibitory or facilitatory effects).

We also aimed to study short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) during sleep with paired-pulse TMS (pp-TMS). Ten healthy volunteers were studied. They were monitored immediately before, during and after a 3-h sleep (from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., immediately after the mid-day meal). EEG was continuously recorded during sleep and the various sleep stages were identified off line. Every 10 min, subjects received ten single stimuli (to estimate RMT, MEP latency and amplitude) and six paired stimuli (to estimate SICI). MEP amplitude decreased and latency and RMT increased during the various sleep stages and returned to baseline values on awakening. Post hoc comparisons showed a significant difference in pp-TMS MEP amplitudes between the sleep and all the other conditions. The changes in TMS evoked variables during the different sleep stages indicate that during nonrapid eye movement sleep, cortical pyramidal neuron excitability (as measured by RMT, MEP latency and amplitude) progressively diminishes and the efficiency of the intracortical GABA-ergic network (as assessed by three pp-TMS) increases. On awakening, these sleep-induced changes in corticospinal excitability return rapidly to values observed during wakefulness.", "pages": "672582"}, {"volume": "186", "title": "Effects of attention on inhibitory and facilitatory phenomena elicited by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy subjects.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10080373", "authors": ["Conte, A", "Belvisi, D", "Iezzi, E", "Mari, F", "Inghilleri, M", "Berardelli, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and H-reflexes were elicited at the time of the short (SLR)-, medium (MLR)-, and long (LLR, LLR(2))-latency responses of the soleus muscle (SOL) after jumps from 31 cm height.

TMS showed no effect at SLR, MLR, and LLR, whereas MEPs were significantly facilitated at the LLR(2) (122%; P = 0.003). Background EMG was highest at LLR and lowest at LLR(2). Strong H-reflex facilitation at the beginning of the stance phase indicated significant contribution of Iotaa-afferent input to the alpha-motoneurons during this phase that then progressively declined toward takeoff. Conversely, corticospinal excitability was exclusively increased at the phase of push off (LLR(2), approximately 120 ms). It is argued that corticomotoneurons increased their excitability at LLR(2). At LLR ( approximately 90 ms), Iotaa-afferent transmission as well as corticospinal excitability was low, whereas background EMG was high.

In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the iSP in 21 adult ADHD patients and twenty-one sex- and age-matched healthy controls. In 16 of these patients, a second TMS was performed under treatment with MPH. Our results indicate a persistence of impaired transcallosally mediated motor cortical inhibition (shortened duration) in ADHD adults, which was correlated with clinical characteristics of hyperactivity and restlessness, and was restored by MPH.

The currently available functional neuroimaging techniques based on hemodynamic principles are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Electrophysiological techniques include electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). As for the coupling between hemodynamic response and neuronal activity (neurovascular coupling), experimental studies suggest that the hemodynamic response is significantly correlated to neuronal activity, especially local field potential (synaptic activity) rather than spiking activity, within a certain range. The hemodynamic response tends to be more widespread in space and lasts longer in time as compared with the neuronal activity. Since each technique has its own characteristic features especially in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, it is important to adopt the most appropriate technique for solving each specific question, and it is useful to combine two techniques either simultaneously or in separate sessions. As for the multi-modal approach, the combined use of EEG and MEG, EEG and PET, or EEG and fMRI is applied for the simultaneous studies, and for the separate use of two different techniques, the information obtained from fMRI is used for estimating the generator source from EEG or MEG data (fMRI-constrained source estimation). Functional connectivity among different brain areas can be studied by using a single technique such as the EEG coherence or the correlation analysis of fMRI or PET data, or by combining the stimulation technique such as TMS with neuroimaging.

Here, we tested the connectivity between left PMd and right M1 as well as the intracortical excitability of PMd in 11 right-handed patients with focal arm/hand dystonia and nine age-matched healthy controls. The results showed that excitability of the inhibitory connection between PMd and M1 was reduced in patients, but there was no significant difference to healthy subjects in the excitability of the facilitatory connection. A triple stimulation technique in which pairs of TMS pulses are given over PMd and their interaction measured in terms of the effect on the baseline PMd-M1 connection failed to reveal the usual pattern of interaction between the pairs of PMd stimuli. Indeed, the results in patients were similar to those seen in a group of young healthy subjects after the excitability of PMd had been changed by pretreatment with high-frequency rTMS.

We compared 12 patients with limb FD to 10 patients with primary adult-onset typically mobile dystonia and 11 age-matched healthy volunteers.
