We studied the effect of rTMS in severe cases of post-stroke after nearly 10 years. They had wide hemispheric lesion and their paresis had not changed for more than 5 years. The majority of patients could not move their fingers on the affected side. In our study we examined whether the active movement could be induced by rTMS even several years after stroke and which hemisphere (affected or unaffected) stimulated by rTMS would be the best location for attenuating the spasticity and for developing movement in the paretic arm. Sixty-four patients (more than 5 years after stroke in a stable state) were followed for 3 months. They were treated with rTMS with 1 Hz at 30% of 2.3T 100 stimuli per session twice a day for a week. The area to be stimulated was chosen according to the evoked movement by TMS in the paretic arm. That way, four groups were created and compared. In group A, where both hemispheres were stimulated (because of the single stimulation of TMS could induce movement from both sides of hemispheres) the spasticity decreased but the movement could not be influenced. A highly significant improvement in spasticity, in movement induction and in the behaviour of paresis was observed in group B, where before treatment, there was no evoked movement in the paretic arm from stimulating either hemispheres of the brain. For treatment we stimulated the unaffected hemisphere from where the intact arm is moved (ipsilateral to the paretic side). In both groups C (contralateral hemisphere to the paretic arm) and D (ipsilaterally evoked movement in the paretic arm), the spasticity decreased during the first week, but the movement of the paretic arm improved only in group C. It seems that spasticity can be modified by the stimulation either the affected or the unaffected hemisphere, but the induction of movement can be achieved only by the stimulation of an intact motor pathway and its surrounding area (groups B and C). The improvement in paretic extremities can be achieved with rTMS even after years of stroke when the traditional rehabilitation has failed.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "A transcranial magnetic stimulation study of transcallosal inhibition and facilitation in schizophrenia.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "18501609", "authors": ["Hoy, KE", "Georgiou-Karistianis, N", "Laycock, R", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "Deficits in cortical inhibition (CI) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including decreased transcallosal inhibition (TCI).

TCI and TCF are thought to maintain a complimentary existence, allowing for the performance of tasks such as unilateral voluntary movement. Therefore, deficient TCI may lead to abnormal expression of TCF. This study aims to confirm the presence of TCI deficits in schizophrenia, and to examine TCF. Thirty consenting participants took part in the study (15 with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls), although not all were able to complete all aspects of the study. TCI and TCF were measured using dual-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation methodologies. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly less TCI than controls; there was no difference in TCF, however.

We used the \"virtual-lesion\" technique of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test the functional relevance of anterior IPS for visuo-tactile crossmodal matching. Two crossmodal (visual encoding and tactile recognition and vice versa) and two unimodal delayed matching-to-sample tests with geometrical patterns were performed by 12 healthy subjects. We determined error rates before and after focal low-frequency rTMS applied over the left anterior IPS, right anterior IPS and vertex. During the manipulation of objects with the right hand, rTMS over the left anterior IPS induced a significant deterioration for visual encoding and tactile recognition, but not for tactile encoding and visual recognition. For the visual and tactile unimodal conditions, no significant alterations in task performance were found. rTMS application over right IPS when manipulating objects with the left hand did not affect crossmodal task performance. In conclusion, we have demonstrated an essential functional role of the left anterior IPS for visuo-tactile matching when manipulating objects with the right hand.

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease affecting both cortical and spinal motor neurons, paired-pulse studies based on electromyographic (EMG) recording have revealed a decrease in TMS-induced inhibition. This suggested that inhibition loss may promote excito-toxicity in this disease. Against this hypothesis, an abnormally high incidence of inhibitory responses to TMS has been observed in the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) in ALS single motor unit studies. The disappearance of cortico-motoneuronal excitatory inputs might, however, have facilitated the detection of single motor unit inhibitory responses in the PSTHs. This question was addressed here using a new approach, where the strength of the excitatory and inhibitory effects of TMS on motoneurone activity was assessed from the duration of inter-spike intervals (ISIs). This analysis was conducted on single motor unit (MU), tested on healthy subjects and patients with ALS or Kennedy's disease (KD), a motor neuron disease which unlike ALS, spares the cortico-spinal pathway. MUs tested on KD patients behaved like those of healthy subjects unlike those tested on ALS patients. The present data reveal that in ALS, the TMS-induced inhibitory effects are truly enhanced during voluntary contractions and not reduced, as observed in paired-pulse TMS studies under resting conditions. The possible contribution of inhibitory loss to the physiopathology of ALS therefore needs to be reconsidered. The present data do not support the idea that inhibition loss may underlie excito-toxicity in ALS.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Time course of the involvement of the right anterior superior temporal gyrus and the right fronto-parietal operculum in emotional prosody perception.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11230699", "authors": ["Hoekert, M", "Bais, L", "Kahn, RS", "Aleman, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "To evaluate the number of seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in patients with focal neocortical epilepsy before, during and after rTMS.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Perception of phosphenes and flashed alphabetical characters is enhanced by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of anterior frontal lobe: the thalamic gate hypothesis.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "11256770", "authors": ["Amassian, V", "Mari, Z", "Sagliocco, L", "Hassan, N", "Maccabee, P", "Cracco, JB", "Cracco, RQ", "Bodis-Wollner, I"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Perception", "abstract": "Twelve patients (seven men and five women, mean age 29.3+/-15.8 years) were studied.

Here, we used triple-pulse repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to shed light on the precise time course of involvement of the right anterior superior temporal gyrus and the right fronto-parietal operculum. We hypothesized that information would be processed in the right anterior superior temporal gyrus before being processed in the right fronto-parietal operculum. Right-handed healthy subjects performed an emotional prosody task. During listening to each sentence a triplet of TMS pulses was applied to one of the regions at one of six time points (400-1900 ms). Results showed a significant main effect of Time for right anterior superior temporal gyrus and right fronto-parietal operculum. The largest interference was observed half-way through the sentence. This effect was stronger for withdrawal emotions than for the approach emotion. A further experiment with the inclusion of an active control condition, TMS over the EEG site POz (midline parietal-occipital junction), revealed stronger effects at the fronto-parietal operculum and anterior superior temporal gyrus relative to the active control condition. No evidence was found for sequential processing of emotional prosodic information from right anterior superior temporal gyrus to the right fronto-parietal operculum, but the results revealed more parallel processing. Our results suggest that both right fronto-parietal operculum and right anterior superior temporal gyrus are critical for emotional prosody perception at a relatively late time period after sentence onset.

These methods induce reversible circumscribed cortical excitability changes, either excitatory or inhibitory, outlasting stimulation in time. Experimental pharmacological interventions may selectively enhance the duration of the aftereffects. Whereas rTMS induces externally triggered changes in the neuronal spiking pattern and interrupts or excites neuronal firing in a spatially and temporally restricted fashion, tDCS modulates the spontaneous firing rates of neurons by changing resting-membrane potential. The easiest and most common way of evaluating the cortical excitability changes is by applying TMS to the motor cortex, since it allows reproducible quantification through the motor-evoked potential. Threshold determinations at the visual cortex or psychophysical methods usually require repeated and longer measurements and thus more time for each data set. Here, results derived from the use of tDCS in visual perception, including contrast as well as motion detection and visuo-motor coordination and learning, are summarised.

This may be the platform on which a combined manual and vocal communication system was constructed.

The present study applied novel threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques to investigate the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in FALS. Studies were undertaken in 14 asymptomatic and 3 pre-symptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers, followed longitudinally for up to 3-years. The pre-symptomatic subjects were asymptomatic at the time of their initial study but developed symptoms during the follow-up period. Results were compared to 7 SOD-1 FALS patients, 50 sporadic ALS patients and 55 normal controls. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was significantly reduced in SOD-1 FALS (-1.2 +/- 0.6%) and sporadic ALS patients (-0.7 +/- 0.3%) compared to asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers (9.8 +/- 1.5%, P<0.00001) and normal controls (8.5 +/- 1.0%, P<0.00001). SICI reduction was accompanied by increases in intracortical facilitation, motor evoked potential amplitudes and the slope of the magnetic stimulus-response curve. In two pre-symptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers SICI was completely absent (SICI patient 1, -3.2%; patients 2, -1.3%), while in one subject there was a 32% reduction in SICI prior to symptom onset. These three individuals subsequently developed clinical features of ALS. Simultaneous investigation of central and peripheral excitability has established that cortical hyperexcitability develops in clinically affected SOD-1 FALS patients, similar to that seen in sporadic ALS patients, thereby suggesting that a similar pathophysiological process in evident in both familial and sporadic ALS patients. In addition, the present study has established that cortical hyperexcitability precedes the development of clinical symptoms in pre-symptomatic carriers of the SOD1 mutation, thereby suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability underlies neurodegeneration in FALS.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "437", "title": "Posterior parietal rTMS disrupts human Path Integration during a vestibular navigation task.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15050601", "authors": ["Seemungal, BM", "Rizzo, V", "Gresty, MA", "Rothwell, JC", "Bronstein, AM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "This study examines how gender and menopausal status contribute to age effect on the antidepressant efficacy of repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS).

To study the relation of repMNDs to other measures of cortico-muscular excitability and to physiological measures of the skill for finely tuned precision movements, we used a previously described quadruple stimulation (QuadS) technique (Z'Graggen et al. 2005) to quantify the amount of repMNDs in abductor digiti minimi muscles (ADMs) on both sides of 20 right-handed healthy subjects.

Moreover, the QuadS amplitude and area increased significantly after finger precision training, but not after force training. This increase of repMNDs correlated significantly with the increase in performance in the finger tapping task.

One hertz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) reduces excitability in the brain region stimulated. Studies utilizing 1-Hz rTMS delivered to the left temporoparietal cortex, a brain area critical to speech perception, have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in AVHs relative to sham simulation. A novel mechanism of AVHs is proposed whereby dramatic pre-psychotic social withdrawal prompts neuroplastic reorganization by the \"social brain\" to produce spurious social meaning via hallucinations of conversational speech. Preliminary evidence supporting this hypothesis includes a very high rate of social withdrawal emerging prior to the onset of frank psychosis in patients who develop schizophrenia and AVHs. Moreover, reduced AVHs elicited by temporoparietal 1-Hz rTMS are likely to reflect enhanced long-term depression. Some evidence suggests a loss of long-term depression following experimentally-induced deafferentation. Finally, abnormal cortico-cortical coupling is associated with AVHs and also is a common outcome of deafferentation. Auditory/verbal hallucinations (AVHs) of spoken speech or \"voices\" are reported by 60-80% of persons with schizophrenia at various times during the course of illness. AVHs are associated with high levels of distress, functional disability, and can lead to violent acts. Among patients with AVHs, these symptoms remain poorly or incompletely responsive to currently available treatments in approximately 25% of cases.

Results showed that at the later stimulation intervals (200 and 300 ms from the double consonant) listening to rare words evoked much larger MEPs than listening to frequent words. Moreover, by comparing pseudo-words embedded with a double consonant requiring or not tongue movements, we found that a pure phonological motor resonance was present only 100 ms after the double consonant. Thus, while the phonological motor resonance appears very early, the lexical-dependent motor facilitation takes more time to appear and depends on the frequency of the stimuli.

The vestibular apparati provide a head angular velocity signal allowing perception of self-motion velocity. Perceived change of angular position-in-space can also be obtained from the vestibular head velocity signal via a process called Path Integration (so-called since displacement is obtained by a mathematical temporal integration of the vestibular velocity signal). It is unknown however, if distinct cortical loci sub-serve vestibular perceptions of velocity versus displacement (i.e. Path Integration). Previous studies of human brain activity have not used head motion stimuli hence precluding localisation of vestibular cortical areas specialised for Path Integration distinct from velocity perception. We inferred vestibular cortical function by measuring the disrupting effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the performance of a displacement-dependent vestibular navigation task. Our data suggest that posterior parietal cortex is involved in encoding contralaterally directed vestibular-derived signals of perceived angular displacement and a similar effect was found for both hemispheres. We separately tested whether right posterior parietal cortex was involved in vestibular-sensed velocity perception but found no association. Overall, our data demonstrate that posterior parietal cortex is involved in human Path Integration but not velocity perception.

Among MNDs, the pseudopolyneuritic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) strictly mimics a neuropathy. We describe the clinical and electrophysiological features in the early stages of the pseudopolyneuritic ALS, and assess the disease progression in eight patients. Early symptoms were unilateral foot-drop and, less commonly, paraparesis. At the clinical examination, weakness of distal and proximal leg muscles was often detected, while the hand muscles were rarely involved and craniobulbar muscles were spared. Definite upper motor neuron signs were rare in the early stages of the disease. Electromyography (EMG) showed active denervation in the lower limbs of all patients (distal > proximal) and in the paraspinal muscles of 7 patients (lumbosacral > thoracic), and more rarely in the upper limbs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) yielded abnormal responses (low amplitude or absent cortical motor evoked potentials and prolonged central motor conduction time) in most lower-limb recordings, while mild abnormalities were rarely observed in the upper limbs. Haematologic and cerebrospinal fluid examinations were normal. Brain and spinal MRI showed no significant abnormalities. After a three years follow-up on seven patients, all cases were nonambulatory and had upper limb weakness, and most of them had bulbar dysfunction. The electrophysiological finding of both upper and lower motor neuron involvement of the lower limbs in the early stages of the disease could be a useful marker to distinguish the pseudopolyneuritic form of ALS from other MNDs and motor neuropathies.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Stimulus-response characteristics of motor evoked potentials and silent periods in proximal and distal upper-extremity muscles.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16988047", "authors": ["van Kuijk, AA", "Anker, LC", "Pasman, JW", "Hendriks, JC", "van Elswijk, G", "Geurts, AC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel technique of non-invasive brain stimulation which has been used to treat several neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, chronic pain and epilepsy. Recent studies have shown that the therapeutic effects of rTMS are associated with plastic changes in local and distant neural networks. In fact, it has been suggested that rTMS induces long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) - like effects. Besides the initial positive clinical results; the effects of rTMS are still mixed. Therefore new tools to assess the effects of plasticity non-invasively might be useful to predict its therapeutic effects and design novel therapeutic approaches using rTMS. In this paper we propose that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) might be such a tool. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a neurotrophin that plays a key role in neuronal survival and synaptic strength, which has also been studied in several neuropsychiatric disorders. There is robust evidence associating BDNF with the LTP/LTD processes, and indeed it has been proposed that BNDF might index an increase or decrease of brain activity - the 'yin and yang' BDNF hypothesis. In this article, we review the initial studies combining measurements of BDNF in rTMS clinical trials and discuss the results and potential usefulness of this instrument in the field of rTMS.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "211", "title": "Effects of rTMS on grip force control following subcortical stroke.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17008369", "authors": ["Dafotakis, M", "Grefkes, C", "Eickhoff, SB", "Karbe, H", "Fink, GR", "Nowak, DA"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Central motor conduction time (CMCT) is usually abnormally prolonged in leg muscles of patients with pure hereditary spastic paraparesis (PHSP). One consequence of such abnormality should be an abnormal timing in the modulation of segmental reflexes, which might be more relevant for the pathophysiology of spasticity-related gait disturbances than just the CMCT delay. We examined the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the soleus H reflex in 13 control subjects and 11 PHSP patients using a conditioning (TMS) and test (H reflex) paradigm. Interstimulus interval (ISI) was 0-100 ms in steps of 10 ms. The amplitude of the H reflex at each interval was expressed as percentage of the control H reflex and the conditioned curves were compared between control subjects and patients. In control subjects, TMS-induced facilitation of the H reflex with two well-defined phases: early (ISIs 10 and 20 ms) and late (ISIs 70-90 ms). In patients, the early phase of facilitation was significantly reduced, while there was facilitation at 40 ms that was not present in control subjects. However, neither the characteristics of the MEP nor the differential modulation of the H reflex correlated significantly with clinical measures of motor dysfunction. Our results indicate an abnormal effect of TMS on the H reflex in PHSP patients. This suggests that the excitability of interneurons and soleus motoneurons is not modified in tune with the arrival of descending inputs. Desynchronization of the descending volley may contribute to both the lack of early facilitation and the presence of abnormal facilitatory phases.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "76", "title": "TMS of the posterior parietal cortex delays the latency of unpredictable saccades but not when they are combined with predictable divergence.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "17097864", "authors": ["Vernet, M", "Yang, Q", "Daunys, G", "Orssaud, C", "Kapoula, Z"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of patients with CNS disorders were obtained using a whole-head 122-channel magnetometer SQUID and analyzed using Fourier statistical analysis.

Right-handed HR (n = 15) and LR (n = 15) subjects, matched for age, gender, height, weight and education, were assessed for psychopathology and family history of alcoholism using the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism and the Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Following single-pulse TMS, an electromyogram recorded from the right opponens pollicis muscle was used to measure the silent periods at different stimulus intensities. HR subjects had significantly shorter contralateral and ipsilateral (iSP) silent periods and a relatively higher prevalence of 'absent' iSP. They had significantly higher mean externalizing symptoms scores (ESS) than LR subjects, and there was a significant negative correlation between iSP duration and ESS. These preliminary findings suggest that HR subjects have relative impairments in corticocortical and transcallosal inhibitory mechanisms.

Motoneuronal excitability and its modulation may also be investigated by conditioned motor evoked potentials (MEPs). To date, effects of exteroceptive stimuli on tonic EMG and on MEPs have been compared mainly using innocuous stimuli, while noxious stimuli have not been studied in great detail. In ten subjects, we recorded CSPs induced in volitionally activated flexor pollicis brevis muscle (FPB) by noxious digit II (D2) stimulation, and in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following noxious D2 and digit V (D5) stimulation. Then, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to evoke MEPs in the same hand muscles at rest--conditioned by equal noxious D2 or D5 stimulation and individually delayed--so that the MEPs occurred at times corresponding to immediately before, during, and immediately after the CSP in each subject. Immediately before the CSP, there was no significant difference between nociceptive MEP modulation and tonic EMG modulation in any muscle-finger-combination. In the middle of the CSP, noxious finger stimulation exerted suppression of TMS-induced MEPs in all the three muscle-finger-combinations, but less so as compared to corresponding tonic EMG levels. After the CSP, MEPs remained suppressed when corresponding tonic EMG levels were significantly enhanced. Notably, MEPs were also suppressed in cases when occurring at times corresponding to the excitatory long-loop reflex. Incomplete MEP suppression during the CSP may allow for an \"emergency grip\" even during noxious stimulation. MEP suppression outlasting the CSP is compatible with a \"passive\" re-synchronization of volitionally activated motor units rather than an \"active\" reflex involving recruitment of corticospinal motoneurons. The differences in tonic EMG and MEP modulation favors an effect of noxious digital nerve stimulation on interneurons responsible for presynaptic inhibition rather than a postsynaptic inhibitory effect on the motoneuron pool. The present findings caution against the use of nociceptive MEP modulation at rest to substitute for tonic EMG modulation as tested in CSP studies.", "pages": "388-95"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Effect of levetiracetam on cortical excitability: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "17634929", "authors": ["Solinas, C", "Lee, YC", "Reutens, DC"], "year": "2008", "journal": "European journal of neurology : the official journal of the European Federation of Neurological Societies", "abstract": "The quick identification of potentially threatening events is a crucial cognitive capacity to survive in a changing environment.
