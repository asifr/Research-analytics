Previous experiments, mostly using visual feedback, have demonstrated that adaptation is highly sensitive to the timing of feedback and can be substantially impaired by delays of 100\u00a0ms or so. Here, we use the phenomenon of surround inhibition (SI) to explore the consequences of somatosensory feedback delay in a task requiring participants to flex the index finger without generating any electromyographical (EMG) activity in other fingers. Participants were requested to perform brief isolated flexion movements of the index finger. After a short period of practice, SI in the distant abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle was quantified by measuring the amplitude of EMG responses evoked by a standard pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation to the contralateral motor cortex at the onset of flexion. SI indicates that the response during flexion was smaller than the response at rest. After this, two training blocks were performed in which the ADM muscle was vibrated (80\u00a0Hz, 100\u00a0ms) either at the onset (VIB(onset)) of finger flexion or with a delay of 100\u00a0ms (VIB(100)). SI was reassessed after training. SI measured after VIB(onset) training was transiently more effective than at baseline. In contrast, SI was unchanged compared to baseline after VIB(100). The present study demonstrates that SI can be modified by experience. The timing of the sensory stimulation was found to be critical for the modification of SI, suggesting that only sensory signals closely related to the movement onset can induce adaptive changes, presumably through a feed-forward process.", "pages": "9-12"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "The effect of stimulus parameters on TMS-EEG muscle artifacts.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "22902312", "authors": ["Mutanen, T", "M\u00e4ki, H", "Ilmoniemi, RJ"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "TMS interference over right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) causally disrupts behaviorally and EEG rhythmic correlates of endogenous spatial orienting before visual target presentation [Capotosto, P., Babiloni, C., Romani, G.

Healthy volunteers (n = 24) performed a Posner spatial cueing task while their EEG activity was being monitored. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) was applied for 150 msec simultaneously to the presentation of a central arrow directing spatial attention to the location of an upcoming visual target. Right IPS-rTMS impaired target detection, especially for stimuli presented at unattended locations; it also caused a modulation of the amplitude of parieto-occipital positive ERPs peaking at about 480 msec (P3) post-target. The P3 significantly decreased for unattended targets and significantly increased for attended targets after right IPS-rTMS as compared with sham stimulation. Similar effects were obtained for left IPS stimulation albeit in a smaller group of volunteers. We conclude that disruption of anticipatory processes in right IPS has prolonged effects that persist during target processing. The P3 decrement may reflect interference with postdecision processes that are part of stimulus-driven reorienting.

Many rehabilitation programs are designed to promote such \"neuroplasticity\" to improve voluntary movement following CNS damage. While much is known about this type of activity-dependent plasticity for the muscles that dorsi-flex the ankle, similar information is not available for the plantar-flexors. Presently, we assessed the excitability of corticospinal (CS) and spinal circuits for both soleus (SOL) muscles before and after voluntary contractions of the right plantar-flexors (VOL; 5 s on-5 s off, 40 min), NMES of the right tibial nerve (tnNMES; 5 s on-5 s off, 40 min), or both together (V + tnNMES). CS excitability for the right (rSOL) and left SOL (lSOL) muscles was assessed by quantifying motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Spinal excitability was assessed using measures from the ascending limb of the M-wave versus H-reflex recruitment curve. CS excitability did not change for rSOL (the activated muscle) or lSOL following any condition. In contrast, there was a marked increase in spinal excitability for rSOL, but only following V + tnNMES; the slope of the M-wave versus H-reflex recruitment curve increased approximately twofold (pre = 7.9; post = 16.2) and H-reflexes collected when the M-wave was ~5 % of the maximal M-wave (M(max)) increased by ~1.5\u00d7 (pre = 19 % M(max), post = 29 % M(max)). Spinal excitability for lSOL did not change following any condition. Thus, only voluntary contractions that were coupled with NMES increased CNS excitability, and this occurred only in the ipsilateral spinal circuitry. These results are in marked contrast to previous studies showing NMES-induced changes in CS excitability for every other muscle studied and suggest that the mechanisms that regulate activity-dependent neuroplasticity are different for SOL than other muscles. Further, while rehabilitation strategies involving voluntary training and/or NMES of the plantar-flexors may be beneficial for producing movement and reducing atrophy, a single session of low-intensity NMES and voluntary training may not be effective for strengthening CS pathways to the SOL muscle.", "pages": "9-12"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Comparison of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging for preoperative mapping in rolandic tumor surgery.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16145540", "authors": ["Coburger, J", "Musahl, C", "Henkes, H", "Horvath-Rizea, D", "Bittl, M", "Weissbach, C", "Hopf, N"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neurosurgical review", "abstract": "Rapid compensatory arm reactions represent important response strategies following an unexpected loss of balance.

The mean accuracy to localize motor cortex of nTMS was higher than in fMRI. In the subgroup of intrinsic tumors, nTMS produced statistically significant higher accuracy scores of the lower extremity localization than fMRI. fMRI failed to localize hand or leg areas in 6 out of 23 cases. Using nTMS, a preoperative localization of the central sulcus was possible in all patients. Verification of nTMS motor cortex localization with DCS was achieved in all cases.

By magnetically perturbing cortical activity while simultaneously recording neuronal responses along the cortico-basal ganglia loop, we were able to directly investigate modifications in descending cortical activity transmission. We found that in both the normal and parkinsonian states, cortical neurons displayed similar multi-phase firing rate modulations in response to magnetic stimulation. However, in the basal ganglia, large synaptically driven stereotypic neuronal modulation was present in the parkinsonian state that was mostly absent in the normal state. The stimulation-induced neuronal activity pattern highlights the change in information propagation along the cortico-basal ganglia loop. Our findings thus point to the role of abnormal dynamic activity transmission rather than changes in baseline activity as a major component in parkinsonian pathophysiology.

Importantly, abnormalities of plasticity as studied by NIBS are directly related to clinical symptoms in neuropsychiatric diseases. Therefore, a core theme of this review is the hypothesis that NIBS-induced plasticity can explore and potentially predict the therapeutic efficacy of CNS-acting drugs in neuropsychiatric diseases. We will (a) review the basics of neuroplasticity, as explored in animal experimentation, and relate these to our knowledge about neuroplasticity induced in humans by NIBS techniques. We will then (b) discuss pharmacological modulation of plasticity in animals and humans.

We used paired pulse protocols assessing short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) to asses cortical excitability over the primary motor cortex and Short Latency Afferent Inhibition (SLAI) protocols, to verify the effects of the drug on central cholinergic transmission in a group of AD patients compared to age-matched controls. We observed that rotigotine induces unexpected changes in both cortical excitability (increased) and central cholinergic transmission (restored) of AD patients. These unexpected effects might depend on the dopamine D\u2082-like receptors dysfunction previously described in AD brains. The current findings could indicate that future strategies aimed to ameliorate symptoms of the related AD cognitive decline could also involve some dopaminergic drugs.

Applying TMS at rest prior to an anticipated contraction provides a measure of cortical excitability that reflects premotor modulatory drive and is uncontaminated by the alterations in spinal and cortical excitability that occur during muscle activation. We hypothesized that premotor structures contribute to unimanual movement through the modulation of intracortical and interhemispheric inhibitory circuits within the primary motor cortex and that this premotor modulation would be evident at rest between contractions. Thus, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) in a 500-ms epoch prior to a planned contraction of the right FDI in 10 participants (21.4\u00b11.9 years). These measures of inhibition were made in three different states: (1) at complete rest (with no plan to contract), (2) at rest between rhythmic contractions, and (3) during low level contractions. Cortical excitability was enhanced prior to a contraction and during a contraction compared to at rest (F\u2082,\u2081\u2088=758.3, p<0.001). IHI was also increased prior to a contraction compared to at rest and during a contraction while SICI was only reduced during a contraction (F\u2082,\u2083\u2088=30.3, p<0.001).We used this pre-contraction protocol to investigate the cortical mechanisms of unimanual control.

One possibility is that IOR acts in an opposite way to spatial attention, such that, whereas spatial attention enhances target related neural signals in visual cortex, IOR suppress target-related signals. Using a novel dual-coil TMS protocol, we found that IOR reduced the probability of detecting a TMS-induced phosphene in extrastriate cortex (V5). Specifically, a nonpredictive spatial precue presented 500 or 800 msec before stimulation significantly reduced the probability of detecting a phosphene when the precue appeared contralaterally to the site of stimulation (i.e., ipsilaterally to the potential location of the phosphene), compared with ipsilaterally or centrally presented cues.

In order to identify the causal role of DLPFC in probabilistic category learning, we investigated whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left DLPFC influences the learning ability in healthy subjects using the weather prediction task (WPT). Application of 10\u00a0Hz rTMS over the left DLPFC induced significant improvement in the total hit rate during the total trials of the WPT, compared with sham stimulation. Specifically, the improvement was significant in the early and late learning blocks of the WPT, but not in the intermediate block of learning.

They also may lend support to the possibility that rTMS can improve implicit learning ability in patients with basal ganglia disorders.", "pages": "9-12"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Focus and selectivity in transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9149760", "authors": ["Schneider, BM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Causal relevance of the cortical area V5/MT for motion (aftereffect) perception has been shown when rTMS pulses have been applied onto this area, leading to disruption of the percept. Typically, the inducing and test stimuli have consisted in a spatially contiguous area from where stimulation is presented. Observers have had no need to divide attention between spatially remote areas including motion-related signals with different vectors. Here we present experimental results showing that an adverse effect of rTMS on motion aftereffect can be obtained when contralateral V5/MT is stimulated and subjects have to report which one of the two simultaneous aftereffect percepts separated into two hemifields decays before the other. The effect appears stronger following right hemisphere V5/MT stimulation and is clearly evident even with weak rTMS pulses.", "pages": "9-12"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "A comparison of two methods in acquiring stimulus-response curves with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15664172", "authors": ["Pearce, AJ", "Clark, RA", "Kidgell, DJ"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a novel therapeutic approach, used in patients with pharmacoresistant auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH).
