Because of technical constraints, the precise effects of TMS on cortical circuits are difficult to assess experimentally. Here, this issue is investigated by constructing a detailed model of a portion of the thalamocortical system and examining the effects of the simulated delivery of a TMS pulse. The model, which incorporates a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints, includes 33,000 spiking neurons arranged in a 3-layered motor cortex and over 5 million intra- and interlayer synaptic connections. The model was validated by reproducing several results from the experimental literature. These include the frequency, timing, dose response, and pharmacological modulation of epidurally recorded responses to TMS (the so-called I-waves), as well as paired-pulse response curves consistent with data from several experimental studies. The modeled responses to simulated TMS pulses in different experimental paradigms provide a detailed, self-consistent account of the neural and synaptic activities evoked by TMS within prototypical cortical circuits.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Bimanual recoupling by visual cueing in callosal disconnection.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "15788269", "authors": ["Seitz, RJ", "Kleiser, R", "B\u00fctefisch, CM", "J\u00f6rgens, S", "Neuhaus, O", "Hartung, HP", "Wittsack, HJ", "Sturm, V", "Hermann, MM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurocase", "abstract": "The cerebral control of bimanual movements is not completely understood.

Thus, two superimposed gratings drifting in a rightward direction composed plaid stimuli whose global motion direction was perceived as the vector sum of the two components. The first experiment was aimed at comparing the perception of plaid motion when both components were presented to both eyes (dioptic) or separately to each eye (dichoptic). When components of the patterns had identical spatial frequencies, coherent motion was correctly perceived under dioptic and dichoptic viewing condition. However, the perceived direction deviated from the predicted direction when spatial frequency differences were introduced between components in both conditions. The results suggest that motion integration follows similar rules for dioptic and dichoptic plaids even though performance under dichoptic viewing did not reach dioptic levels. In the second experiment, the role of early cortical areas in the processing of both plaids was examined. As convergence of monocular inputs is needed for dichoptic perception, we tested the hypothesis that primary visual cortex (V1) is required for dichoptic plaid processing by delivering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to this area. Ten minutes of magnetic stimulation disrupted subsequent dichoptic perception for approximately 15 min, whereas no significant changes were observed for dioptic plaid perception.

However, recent evidence suggests that higher sensorimotor integration processes are involved. A study using H2(15)O positron emission tomography demonstrated that the application of sensory trick stimulus, resulting in a near-neutral head position, led to an increased activation mainly of the superior and inferior parietal lobules (ipsilateral to head turn) and bilateral occipital cortex and to a decreased activity of the supplementary motor area and the primary sensorimotor cortex (contralateral to head turn).

Compared with the healthy control group, both SICI (measured at a range of conditioning intensities) and SAI were reduced in patients. This is consistent with the suggestion that reduced excitability of cortical inhibition is one factor that contributes to the difficulty that patients have in suppressing involuntary tics. In addition, the reduced SAI indicates that impaired intracortical inhibition may not be limited to the motor cortex but also involves circuits linking sensory input and motor output. A single dose of nicotine reduced tic severity as assessed by blind video scoring in the majority of patients. In addition, it abolished the difference between patients and controls in SICI and SAI.

Repetitive TMS (rTMS) (at 1 or 10 Hz) was applied in separate sessions during the last 15 min of LD. PTs significantly decreased after 45 min of LD. rTMS differentially modified the effects of 60 min LD on PTs depending on stimulation frequency. One hertz rTMS did not change the decreasing of PT values as observed in baseline condition, but significantly prolonged the time to recover T0 PT values after light re-exposure. By contrast, 10 Hz rTMS significantly increased PT and the time to recover T0 PT values after light re-exposure was shortened. The results of this study show that the modulatory effects of different rTMS frequencies on visual cortex critically depend on the pre-existing excitability state of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits, and provide novel insights into the neurophysiological changes that take place in the visual cortex following functional visual deafferentation.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Gaze-dependent deviation in pointing induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the human posterior parietal cortex.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11707100", "authors": ["van Donkelaar, P", "Adams, J"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of motor behavior", "abstract": "Examine whether one session of high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would induce any measurable cognitive changes in patients with cerebrovascular disease and mild cognitive deficits.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "146", "title": "Motor control of the costal and crural diaphragm--insights from transcranial magnetic stimulation in man.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11825684", "authors": ["Sharshar, T", "Hopkinson, NS", "Ross, ET", "Jonville, S", "Dayer, MJ", "Nickol, AH", "Lofaso, F", "Moxham, J", "Polkey, MI"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Respiratory physiology & neurobiology", "abstract": "Seven patients with cerebrovascular disease and mild executive dysfunction entered the randomised, controlled, blinded study with a crossover design. rTMS was applied either over the left DLPFC (an active stimulation site) or over the left motor cortex (MC; a control stimulation site) in one session.

Using functional MRI data to guide application of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS), this study examined the necessity of left and right pVLPFC for episodic encoding (as expressed through subsequent memory performance). To assess the timing of critical computations, pVLPFC function was transiently disrupted at different poststimulus onset times while subjects made syllable decisions about visually presented familiar and unfamiliar words; subsequent memory for these stimuli was measured. Results revealed that left pVLPFC disruption during encoding of familiar words impaired subsequent memory, expressed as a decline in recognition confidence, with disruption being maximal at 380 ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, right pVLPFC disruption facilitated subsequent memory for familiar words, expressed as an increase in medium confidence recognition, with this facilitation being maximal at 380 ms. Finally, phonological (syllable) decision accuracy was facilitated by right pVLPFC disruption, with this effect being maximal at 340 ms, but was unaffected by left pVLPFC disruption. These findings suggest that left pVLPFC mechanisms onset between 300 and 400 ms during phonological processing of words, with these mechanisms appearing necessary for effective episodic encoding.

Hanajima, Y. Shiio, N.K. Iwara, Y. Ugawa, Remote effects of self-paced teeth clenching on the excitability of hand motor area, Exp. Brain Res., 148 (2003) 261-265], these modulatory effects on MEPs to both AM and PL directed currents must be due to changes of the motor cortical excitability. Thus, we conclude that VTC affects the motor cortical circuits activated by PL and AM directed currents differentially; it facilitates the one and inhibits the other. This is the first demonstration of opposite effects of the same maneuver on MEP responses elicited by AM and PL directed currents.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "[Accuracy of the prognostic diagnosis in acute peripheral facial palsy].", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8410704", "authors": ["Aoyagi, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai kaiho", "abstract": "Connections between the cerebellum and the contralateral motor cortex are dense and important, but their physiological significance is difficult to measure in humans. We have studied a group of 10 healthy subjects to test whether a modulation of the excitability of the left cerebellum can affect the excitability of the contralateral motor cortex. We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at 1 Hz frequency to transiently depress the excitability of the left cerebellar cortex and paired-pulse TMS testing of intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) to probe the excitability of cortico-cortical connections in the right motor cortex. The cortical silent period was also measured before and after cerebellar rTMS. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were significantly larger after than before conditioning rTMS trains (p < 0.01). Moreover, left cerebellar rTMS increased the ICF of the right motor cortex as measured with paired-pulses separated by an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 15 ms. The effect lasted for up to 30 min afterward and was specific for the contralateral (right) motor cortex. The cortical silent period was unaffected by cerebellar rTMS.

Peripheral nerve inputs have an inhibitory effect on motor cortex excitability at short intervals (short latency afferent inhibition, SAI). We investigated whether GABA(A) activity enhancement by lorazepam modifies SAI.

Twenty-one subjects (eleven females, median age, 38 years) were studied. SPs were obtained with a figure-of-eight coil using a standardized procedure (recording, FDI). Pilot experiments indicated that at least four trials were required, at each intensity level, to estimate the mean SP duration within 10% of the true mean. Therefore, SPs were determined from the average of four trials with 5% increments from 5 to 100% maximum SI. In a second set of experiments, SPs were obtained for fifteen subjects using a circular coil. In a third set of experiments, eight epileptic patients were studied before and after administration of oxcarbazepine (mean dose 1553 mg, range 900-1800 mg). The S-R curves were fitted to a Boltzman function and to first-order to fourth-order polynomial and sigmoid functions. The Boltzman function described the data accurately (R2=0.947-0.990). In addition, direct comparison of the six models with an F-test proved the superiority of the first. The best-fit parameters of the reference curve, i.e. the maximum and minimum values, the slope, and V50 (the SI at which SP duration is halfway between Min and Max) were 230.8+/-3.31 ms (x+/-SEM), -11.51+/-3.31 ms, 11.56+/-0.65%, and 49.82+/-0.65%, respectively. When the curves obtained with the circular coil were compared with those obtained with the figure-of-eight coil, there were differences between V50 (51.69+/-0.72 vs 47.95+/-0.82, P<0.001) and SP threshold (31.15 vs 24.77, P<0.01) whereas the other best-fit values did not differ significantly. Oxcarbazepine increased corticomotor threshold from 45.3+/-5.8% at baseline to 59.4+/-10.4% (P<0.001). According to the commonly used method, the drug significantly prolonged SP (from 117.6+/-42.4 ms to 143.5+/-46.5 ms, P<0.001) and, consequently, enhanced brain inhibition. In contrast, study of the SP curves led to the conclusion that oxcarbazepine does not affect the Max value and slope but significantly increases V50 and SP threshold (from 54.5+/-4.9% to 59.9+/-7.2% and from 29.1+/-6.4% to 34.6+/-6.8%, respectively, P<0.01). These findings imply that oxcarbazepine does not enhance brain inhibitory mechanisms. Thus, in situations characterized by significant changes in corticomotor threshold the proposed method provides results clearly different from a commonly used approach. It is concluded that S-R curves obtained with a figure-of-eight coil in 5% increments and fitted to a Boltzman function provide an accurate, comprehensive, and clinically applicable method for exploring SP.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Central and peripheral motor conduction to cremasteric muscle.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9448645", "authors": ["Ertekin, C", "Bademkiran, F", "Yildiz, N", "Ozdedeli, K", "Altay, B", "Aydogdu, I", "Uludag, B"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been successful in the prediction of motor recovery in acute stroke patients with initially severe paresis or paralysis of the upper extremity. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) appear to have a high specificity but a rather low sensitivity with regard to motor recovery. The silent period (SP) has been proposed as an additional factor to the MEP for predicting motor recovery that might optimize the sensitivity of TMS. The authors reviewed the literature and case series focusing on the additional value of the SP to the MEP for predicting poststroke hand motor recovery. Studies that have analyzed the SP for predicting poststroke motor recovery have rather inconsistent results and suffer from heterogeneity in technical methods, methodology, and patient characteristics. In most studies, prolonged SPs have been found immediately after stroke, whereas in the (sub)acute phase thereafter, different patterns of SP duration have been found. These differences are thought to be related to stroke localization, though contraction-induced reduction phenomena and recovery-related intracortical phenomena may also be responsible. Although the SP might be used to identify clinically silent or minor strokes, in acute stroke patients with initial severe paresis or paralysis, the SP seems to have no additional value to MEP for predicting poststroke motor recovery. Nevertheless, the SP (poststroke-reduced SPs and contraction-induced inhibitory phenomena) has been proposed as a prognostic factor for poststroke spasticity. This review emphasizes the significance of the SP in predicting poststroke motor recovery and spasticity. Although the relation among the SP, recovery-related intracortical phenomena, and spasticity remains unclear, a neurophysiologic model underlying the SP is discussed. However, more research is needed on the value of the SP for predicting poststroke spasticity.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "163", "title": "Modulation of intracortical excitability in human hand motor areas.

However, not all patients with FHD have a strict history of excessive hand use; for example, patients with musician's dystonia (MD) spend many hours per day with their attention focused on instrumental practice, whereas many patients with writer's cramp (WC) have a history of average hand use. The present experiments test whether seven MD and six WC patients have different pathophysiological deficits by examining the spatial pattern of sensorimotor organization in the motor cortex. Two control groups were used, eight healthy non-musicians and eight healthy musicians. The latter served to control for physiological adaptation of the brain to musical training. We used focal vibration of a single hand muscle to produce sensory input whilst the excitability of corticospinal outputs to the vibrated and other hand muscles was evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation. In healthy non-musicians, vibration increases the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials and decreases the short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the vibrated muscle, whilst having the opposite effect on the non-vibrated hand muscles. The pattern of sensorimotor interaction was abnormal in both patient groups. However, the nature of the deficit differed between them. While vibration had little effect on cortical excitability in WC, it strongly reduced SICI in all hand muscles irrespective of spatial organization in MD. In the healthy musicians we found an organization intermediate between that of healthy non-musicians and MD. The data are consistent with a model in which musical practice in healthy musicians leads to beneficial changes in organization of the motor cortex, but in MD these progress too far and begin to interfere with movement rather than assist it. The fact that sensory input had no effect on motor output in patients with WC suggests that sensory information from the hand may play a smaller role in provoking pathological changes in WC than in MD.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "188", "title": "[Depression and aging].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "9762964", "authors": ["L\u00f4o, H", "Gallarda, T", "Fabre, I", "Oli\u00e9, JP"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Bulletin de l'Acad\u00e9mie nationale de m\u00e9decine", "abstract": "Because somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) recorded from the brain are carried solely within the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, SSEP monitoring may fail to detect damage to the spinal cord motor pathways, and techniques for directly monitoring the motor pathways have been developed. Transcranial magnetic brain stimulation is useful for extraoperative evaluation of the motor system, but anesthetic effects on cortical synaptic activity limit its usefulness for intraoperative monitoring. Another proposed monitoring technique, rostral spinal cord stimulation with recording from peripheral nerves, predominantly reflects retrograde conduction within the dorsal columns; like SSEPs, this technique may fail to detect motor pathway damage. The true motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring technique preferred by most institutions involves transcranial electrical brain stimulation. This stimulates the corticospinal tract axons directly, producing a D-wave in them. There may be additional corticospinal tract volleys, reflecting indirect activation of the pyramidal cells via synapses from cortical interneurons; these I-waves are largely suppressed by anesthesia. Temporal summation at the alpha motor neuron synapse is necessary to elicit myogenic MEPs (M-waves) under anesthesia; this is accomplished with brief trains of stimuli that produce multiple pyramidal tract volleys. High stimulus intensities are required to stimulate the brain through an intact skull; with proper precautions, this is acceptably safe. Myogenic MEPs are quite sensitive to anesthesia and show considerable run-to-run variability. Therefore, criteria for evaluating MEPs differ from those for SSEPs, and the anesthetic regimen and degree of neuromuscular blockade must be carefully controlled. SSEPs should be monitored concurrently with MEPs, because the dorsal columns may be affected without compromise of the motor tracts, and also because this provides redundancy, with two independent assessments of spinal cord function.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "563", "title": "Interactions between long latency afferent inhibition and interhemispheric inhibitions in the human motor cortex.", "issue": "Pt 3", "pmid": "9840891", "authors": ["Kukaswadia, S", "Wagle-Shukla, A", "Morgante, F", "Gunraj, C", "Chen, R"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "To determine the effect of massed practice (MP) versus massed practice combined with somatosensory stimulation (MP+SS) on cortical plasticity and function in persons with incomplete tetraplegia.", "pages": "622-39"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Modality-specific cognitive function of medial and lateral human Brodmann area 6.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15537995", "authors": ["Tanaka, S", "Honda, M", "Sadato, N"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Ten subjects were assigned to either MP or MP+SS.
