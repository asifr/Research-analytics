Promising new interventions to address reaching rehabilitation using robotic training devices are currently under investigation in clinical trials but the neural mechanisms that underlie these interventions are not understood. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be used to probe such mechanisms quickly and non-invasively, by mapping muscle and movement representations in the primary motor cortex (M1). Here we investigate movement maps in healthy young subjects at rest using TMS in the robotic environment, with the goal of determining the range of TMS accessible movements, as a starting point for the study of cortical plasticity in combination with robotic therapy. We systematically stimulated the left motor cortex of 14 normal volunteers while the right hand and forearm rested in the cradle of a two degree-of-freedom planar rehabilitation robot (IMT). Maps were created by applying 10 stimuli at each of nine locations (3x3 cm(2) grid) centered on the M1 movement hotspot for each subject, defined as the stimulation location that elicited robot cradle movements of the greatest distance. TMS-evoked movement kinematics were measured by the robotic encoders and ranged in magnitude from 0 to 3 cm. Movement maps varied by subject and by location within a subject. However, movements were very consistent within a single stimulation location for a given subject. Movement vectors remained relatively constant (limited to <90 degrees section of the planar field) within some subjects across the entire map, while others covered a wider range of directions. This may be due to individual differences in cortical physiology or anatomy, resulting in a practical limit to the areas that are TMS-accessible.

We argued that participants are more likely to use a global mechanism when speed is of the essence, whereas they are more likely to use a selective mechanism when they have foreknowledge of which response tendency they may need to stop. Here we further investigate the relationship between foreknowledge and selective stopping. In Experiment 1 we adapted the earlier design to show that individual differences in recall accuracy for the stopping goal correlate with the selectivity of the stopping. This confirms that encoding and using a foreknowledge memory cue is a key enabler for a selective stopping mechanism. In Experiment 2, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to test the hypothesis that foreknowledge \"sets up\" a control set whereby control is applied onto the response representation that may need to be stopped in the future. We applied TMS to the left motor cortex and measured motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right hand while participants performed a similar behavioral paradigm as Experiment 1. In the foreknowledge period, MEPs were significantly reduced for trials where the right hand was the one that might need to be stopped relative to when it was not.

The repetitive application (rTMS), causing longer lasting effects, was used to study the influence on a variety of cerebral functions. High-frequency (>1 Hz) rTMS is known to depolarize neurons under the stimulating coil and to indirectly affect areas being connected and related to emotion and behavior. Researchers found selective cognitive improvement after high-frequency (HF) stimulation specifically over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This article provides a systematic review of HF-rTMS studies (1999-2009) stimulating over the prefrontal cortex of patients suffering from psychiatric/neurological diseases or healthy volunteers, where the effects on cognitive functions were measured. The cognitive effect was analyzed with regard to the impact of clinical status (patients/healthy volunteers) and stimulation type (verum/sham). RTMS at 10, 15 or 20 Hz, applied over the left DLPFC, within a range of 10-15 successive sessions and an individual motor threshold of 80-110%, is most likely to cause significant cognitive improvement. In comparison, patients tend to reach a greater improvement than healthy participants. Limitations concern the absence of healthy groups in clinical studies and partly the absence of sham groups. Thus, future investigations are needed to assess cognitive rTMS effects in different psychiatric disorders versus healthy subjects using an extended standardized neuropsychological test battery.

This is true to such an extent that the human motor cortex is deeply involved in reflex regulation and it is common to speak of \"transcortical reflex loops.\" Such loops appear to add flexibility to the human stretch reflex, once considered to be immutable, allowing it to adapt across a range of functional tasks. However, the purpose of this adaptation remains unclear. A common proposal is that stretch reflexes contribute to the regulation of limb stability; increased reflex sensitivity during tasks performed in unstable environments supports this hypothesis. Alternatively, before movement onset, stretch reflexes can assist an imposed stretch, opposite to what would be expected from a stabilizing response. Here we show that stretch reflex modulation in tasks that require changes in limb stability is mediated by motor cortical pathways, and that these differ from pathways contributing to reflex modulation that depend on how the subject is instructed to react to an imposed perturbation. By timing muscle stretches such that the modulated portion of the reflex occurred within a cortical silent period induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, we abolished the increase in reflex sensitivity observed when individuals stabilized arm posture within a compliant environment.

We combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the occipital pole and psychophysics for \"neurometric\" and psychometric assays of changes in low-level visual cortex excitability (i.e., phosphene induction) and perception, respectively. Across three experiments we show that structured looming sounds considerably enhance visual cortex excitability relative to other sound categories and white-noise controls. The time course of this effect showed that modulation of visual cortex excitability started to differ between looming and stationary sounds for sound portions of very short duration (80 ms) that were significantly below (by 35 ms) perceptual discrimination threshold.

In these years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively, new paradigms of stimulation have been developed (e.g., patterned repetitive TMS) and technical advances have led to new device designs and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

When guided by the detailed localizing and mapping capabilities of fMRI, TMS can be used as a means by which the functional roles of different visual areas can be investigated. This review highlights recent insights that the techniques of fMRI and TMS have given us with regard to the function and contributions of the many different visual areas to human visual perception.", "pages": "98-103"}, {"volume": "164", "title": "Horizontal and vertical dimensions of visual extinction: a theta burst stimulation study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17978047", "authors": ["Cazzoli, D", "M\u00fcri, RM", "Hess, CW", "Nyffeler, T"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by demyelination and axonal degeneration. Corpus callosum (CC) is commonly involved during the disease process leading to atrophy (93%). Currently, there are no established markers of disease progression and the interplay of processes leading to brain atrophy in MS remains unknown. The primary aim of this study was to assess the frequency of CC atrophy in MS patients. Furthermore, the relationship between expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked motor potentials (MEP) were assessed to capture disease effects by independent parameters. Seventy-nine MS patients and 50 controls were included and their CC volumes were assessed. Out of 79 patients, 31 patients (39\u00b72%) had CC atrophy. The distribution of EDSS scores among the group with CC atrophy [13 (32%) patients with EDSS 0-2; 11 (58%) patients with EDSS 2-4; 19 (24%) patients with EDSS \u22654] was not statistically significant (p>0\u00b705). MEP latency was abnormal in 34 (43%) patients, 67 (85%) patients had abnormal MEP amplitude and CMCT was abnormal in 32 (41%) patients. The relation between EDSS and MEP was statistically significant among the patient population including the subgroup of patients with CC atrophy (p<0.05). Our results lacked to provide an association between disability and CC atrophy, but there was a correlation between CC atrophy and TMS evoked motor potentials. Early evolution of axonal degeneration and brain atrophy should be considered in terms of follow-up measures to provide long-term efficiency impacting disability, progression and brain atrophy.", "pages": "98-103"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Role of 1 and 3 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor function recovery after acute ischaemic stroke.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "17942623", "authors": ["Khedr, EM", "Abdel-Fadeil, MR", "Farghali, A", "Qaid, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "European journal of neurology : the official journal of the European Federation of Neurological Societies", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of posterior parietal vs. superior temporal sites cause differential effects on conventional conjunction vs. feature search tasks, respectively.

SICF occurs at three distinct phases and is likely to be related to the generation of indirect (I) waves. Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is an inhibitory phenomenon and intracortical facilitation (ICF) is an excitatory phenomenon occurring in the M1 that can be studied with TMS. We studied the interactions between SICI/ICF and SICF in 17 healthy subjects. Six experiments were conducted. The first experiment examined the effects of different S1 intensities on SICI, ICF and SICF at three peaks. The effects of SICI on SICF were tested by a triple-pulse TMS protocol in the second experiment. We performed Experiments 3-5 to further test the interactions between SICI and SICF with various strengths of SICI, at SICF peaks and troughs, and with SICF generated by different current direction which preferentially generates late I waves. The effects of ICF on SICF were examined in Experiment 6. The results showed that ICF and SICF decreased whereas SICI increased with higher S1 intensities. SICI facilitated SICF mediated by late I waves both at the peaks and the troughs of SICF. The increase of SICF in the presence of SICI correlated to the strength of SICI. ICF decreased the third peak of SICF. We conclude that SICI facilitates SICF at neuronal circuits responsible for generating late I waves through disinhibition, while ICF may have the opposite effects.", "pages": "98-103"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "\"All that spikes is not fits\", mistaking the woods for the trees: the interictal spikes--an \"EEG chameleon\" in the interface disorders of brain and mind: a critical review.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10716702", "authors": ["Shelley, BP", "Trimble, MR"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "We investigated the analgesic effects of unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in two models of experimental pain in healthy volunteers. Two studies were carried out in parallel in two groups of 26 paid healthy volunteers. The effects of active or sham rTMS (frequency, 10Hz; intensity, 80% resting motor threshold) applied to the right M1 or DLPFC were compared in a double-blind randomized cross-over design. In the first series of experiments, we analyzed the effects of rTMS on thermal (heat and cold) detection and pain thresholds measured on both hands and the left foot, by standardized quantitative sensory testing methods. In the second series of experiments, we measured the effects of M1 or DLPFC rTMS on the threshold and recruitment curves of the RIII nociceptive reflex evoked by ipsilateral electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and recorded on the biceps femoris of both lower limbs. In both studies, measurements were taken before and up to 60min after the end of rTMS. Active rTMS of both M1 and DLPFC significantly increased the thermal pain thresholds, measured for both hands and the left foot, this effect being most marked for cold pain. These effects, which lasted at least 1h after rTMS, were selective because they were not associated with changes in non-painful thermal sensations. By contrast, the second study showed that rTMS of M1 or DLPFC had no significant effect on the threshold or recruitment curve of the nociceptive flexion RIII reflex. Our findings demonstrate that unilateral rTMS of M1 or DLPFC induces diffuse and selective analgesic effects in healthy volunteers. The lack of effect on the RIII reflex suggests that such analgesic effects may not depend on the activation of descending inhibitory systems.", "pages": "98-103"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Advances in the application of technology to epilepsy: the CIMIT/NIO Epilepsy Innovation Summit.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11352607", "authors": ["Schachter, SC", "Guttag, J", "Schiff, SJ", "Schomer, DL", ""], "year": "2009", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate if laser therapy in combination with pulsed electromagnetic field therapy/repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would lead to positive treatment results for hyperacusis patients.", "pages": "98-103"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Coding of visual space during motor preparation: Approaching objects rapidly modulate corticospinal excitability in hand-centered coordinates.", "issue": "38", "pmid": "11698506", "authors": ["Makin, TR", "Holmes, NP", "Brozzoli, C", "Rossetti, Y", "Farn\u00e8, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Eight of the first ten patients treated for tinnitus, who were also suffering from chronic hyperacusis, claimed their hyperacusis improved.
