It is now recognized that the pre-SMA is part of a \"cognitive control\" network involving the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and subcortical regions, such as the striatum and subthalamic nucleus. However, two important questions remain to be addressed. First, it is not clear if the main role of the pre-SMA in cognitive control lies in inhibition or switching of actions. From imaging evidence, the right pre-SMA is consistently recruited during inhibition and switching, but the extent to which it participates specifically in either of these processes is unknown. Secondly, the pre-SMA may perform inhibition and switching alone or as part of a larger brain network. The present study used online and offline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to dissociate the roles of pre-SMA in cognitive control, but also to investigate the potential contribution of connectivity between the pre-SMA and IFG. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over the right IFG before participants performed a stop switching task while receiving single TMS pulses over the right pre-SMA. The results were compared to a sham cTBS session and pulses applied over the vertex region. Significant worsening of inhibition as well as response adaptation during inhibition was found when applying pulses over the pre-SMA. However, no such worsening was observed in switch trials. Additionally, after cTBS over the IFG, inhibition was also delayed, suggesting its critical necessity in stopping of actions. The results reveal a key contribution of the pre-SMA in inhibition and could suggest a dissociative role in the switching of actions.

The mechanisms by which riluzole exerts neuroprotective effects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains to be fully elucidated, although inhibition of glutamatergic transmission and modulation of Na+ channel function have been proposed. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which riluzole exerts neuroprotective effects, in particular to dissect the relative contributions of inhibition of glutamatergic transmission and Na+ channel modulation, the present study utilized a combination of cortical and peripheral axonal excitability approaches to monitor changes in excitability and function in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cortical assessment was undertaken by utilising the threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique and combined with peripheral axonal excitability studies in 25 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Studies were performed at baseline and repeated when patients were receiving riluzole 100 mg/day. At the time of second testing all patients were tolerating the medication well. Motor evoked potential and compound muscle action potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. At baseline, features of cortical hyperexcitability were evident in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, indicated by marked reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition (P < 0.001) and cortical silent period duration (P < 0.001), as well as an increase in the motor evoked potential amplitude (P < 0.01). Riluzole therapy partially normalized cortical excitability by significantly increasing short interval intracortical inhibition (short interval intracortical inhibitionbaseline 0.5 \u00b1 1.8%; short interval intracortical inhibitionON riluzole 7.9 \u00b1 1.7%, P < 0.01). In contrast, riluzole did not exert any modulating effect on cortical silent period duration (P = 0.45) or motor evoked potential amplitude (P = 0.31). In terms of peripheral nerve function, axonal excitability studies established that, relative to control subjects, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had significant increases in depolarizing threshold electrotonus [amyotrophic lateral sclerosisbaseline TEd (90-100 ms) 49.1 \u00b1 1.8%; controlsTEd (90-100 ms) 45.2 \u00b1 0.6%, P < 0.01] and superexcitability (amyotrophic lateral sclerosisbaseline 30.1 \u00b1 2.3%; control subjects 23.4 \u00b1 1.0%, P < 0.01) at baseline. Following institution of riluzole therapy there was a significant reduction in superexcitability (amyotrophic lateral sclerosisbaseline 30.1 \u00b1 2.3%; amyotrophic lateral sclerosisON riluzole 27.3 \u00b1 2.3%, P < 0.05) and refractoriness at 2 ms (amyotrophic lateral sclerosisbaseline 98.7 \u00b1 10.7%; amyotrophic lateral sclerosisON riluzole 67.8 \u00b1 9.3%, P < 0.001). In conclusion, the present study has established that riluzole exerts effects on both central and peripheral nerve function, interpreted as partial normalization of cortical hyperexcitability and reduction of transient Na+ conductances. Taken together, these findings suggest that the neuroprotective effects of riluzole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are complex, with evidence of independent effects across both compartments of the nervous system.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "8", "title": "The supplementary motor area exerts a tonic excitatory influence on corticospinal projections to phrenic motoneurons in awake humans.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "23614046", "authors": ["Laviolette, L", "Ni\u00e9rat, MC", "Hudson, AL", "Raux, M", "Allard, E", "Similowski, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sensorimotor integration is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long latency afferent inhibition (LAI) measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to measure sensorimotor integration. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been found to restore these abnormalities, but the time course of these changes is not known. We prospectively evaluated the short-term and long-term effects of STN DBS on SAI, LAI and proprioception. We hypothesised plasticity changes induced by chronic stimulation are necessary to normalise sensorimotor integration and proprioception. METHODS: Patients with PD were studied preoperatively, at 1 month and more than 6 months postoperatively. SAI was tested with median nerve stimulation to the wrist preceding TMS pulse to motor cortex by \u223c20 ms and LAI by 200 ms. Proprioception (distance and spatial errors) in the arm was quantitatively assessed. For postoperative assessments, patients were studied in the medication-off/stimulator-off, medication-off/stimulator-on, medication-on/stimulator-off and medication-on/stimulator-on conditions. RESULTS: 11 patients with PD and 10 controls were enrolled. Preoperatively, SAI and proprioception was abnormal during the medication-on conditions and LAI was reduced regardless of the medication status. STN DBS had no significant effect on SAI, LAI and proprioception at 1 month. However, at 6 months SAI, LAI and distance errors were normalised in the medication-on/stimulator-on condition. Spatial error was normalised with DBS on and off.

Dopaminergic drugs are the focus of many therapies targeting the motor system, where high inter-individual differences in response are common. The current study examined the hypothesis that genetic variation in the dopamine system is associated with significant differences in motor learning, brain plasticity, and the effects of the dopamine precursor L-Dopa. Skilled motor learning and motor cortex plasticity were assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 50 healthy adults during two study weeks, one with placebo and one with L-Dopa. The influence of five polymorphisms with established effects on dopamine neurotransmission was summed using a gene score, with higher scores corresponding to higher dopaminergic neurotransmission. Secondary hypotheses examined each polymorphism individually. While training on placebo, higher gene scores were associated with greater motor learning (p = .03). The effect of L-Dopa on learning varied with the gene score (gene score*drug interaction, p = .008): participants with lower gene scores, and thus lower endogenous dopaminergic neurotransmission, showed the largest learning improvement with L-Dopa relative to placebo (p<.0001), while L-Dopa had a detrimental effect in participants with higher gene scores (p = .01). Motor cortex plasticity, assessed via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), also showed a gene score*drug interaction (p = .02). Individually, DRD2/ANKK1 genotype was significantly associated with motor learning (p = .02) and its modulation by L-Dopa (p<.0001), but not with any TMS measures. However, none of the individual polymorphisms explained the full constellation of findings associated with the gene score. These results suggest that genetic variation in the dopamine system influences learning and its modulation by L-Dopa. A polygene score explains differences in L-Dopa effects on learning and plasticity most robustly, thus identifying distinct biological phenotypes with respect to L-Dopa effects on learning and plasticity.

They were compared with 15 age- and sex-matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response time and its 4 subparts, processing time, conduction time, motor time, and movement time. These were assessed with an electromyogram-supported lower-limb response time task and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure the motor-evoked potential latency of the M. tibialis anterior. In addition, participants were tested for lower-extremity muscle strength, gait capacity, visual acuity, and upper-extremity response time. RESULTS: Well-recovered subjects with incomplete paraplegia still suffered from deficits in conduction and movement time, whereas their processing and motor times were essentially normal. In addition, these patients showed delayed movement times of the upper limb, even if their injury was located in the thoracic or lumbar region.

Eleven healthy individuals and 11 MS patients completed a series of transcranial magnetic stimulation studies to examine central conduction and cortical excitability under thermoneutral and heat-stressed (HS) conditions at rest and after a fatiguing thumb abduction task.

We examined neuroplasticity in a cortical region not considered to be a primary component of the central pain matrix in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) patients. We hypothesised that neuroplasticity would be exaggerated in CTTH patients compared to healthy controls, which might explain (in part) the development of chronic pain in these individuals. METHODS: Neuroplasticity was examined following a ballistic motor training task in CTTH patients and control subjects (CS). Changes in peak acceleration (motor learning) and motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation were compared. RESULTS: CTTH patients showed significantly less motor learning on the training task than CS (mean acceleration increase 87% CTTH, 204% CS, P \u2009<\u2009.05), and CS but not CTTH patients showed a significant increased MEP amplitude following training (CS: F \u2009=\u20092.9, P \u2009<\u2009.05; CTTH: F \u2009=\u20091.6, P \u2009>\u2009.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a deficit in use-dependent neuroplasticity within networks responsible for task performance in CTTH patients which might reflect reciprocal influences between primary motor cortex and interconnected pain processing networks.

For instance, the perception of the orientation of a book can be enhanced when preparing to grasp it (but not when pointing to it). However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood. We argue that brain areas controlling arm movements are involved in establishing this effect through top-down feedback to early visual areas, similar to the neuronal mechanisms linking visual attention and eye movements. To investigate this involvement, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation to a grasping motor area, the left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), during grasping or pointing preparation. Concurrently, an orientation change detection task was performed. As a control area, the vertex was stimulated. We found that stimulation of aIPS selectively modulates orientation sensitivity during action preparation compared with control stimulation (vertex), negating the increased orientation sensitivity with grasping preparation over pointing preparation. We argue that aIPS is a critical part of the mechanism underlying perceptual modulations during action preparation. The present results and recent literature suggest that this action-modulated perception for hand movements is implemented through a cortical feedback connection between aIPS and early visual areas.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Stimulation of the Pre-SMA Influences Cerebral Blood Flow in Frontal Areas Involved with Inhibitory Control of Action.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1953408", "authors": ["Obeso, I", "Cho, SS", "Antonelli, F", "Houle, S", "Jahanshahi, M", "Ko, JH", "Strafella, AP"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Neural plasticity is crucial for understanding the experience-dependent reorganization of brain regulatory circuits and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

The phenotype is a promising marker for the effects of plasticity-enhancing interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and can be studied in healthy volunteers in the absence of illness-related confounds, but the relationship to brain plasticity is unexplored. We recruited 39 healthy volunteers to investigate the effects of 5 Hz rTMS on prefrontal-hippocampal coupling during working memory and rest. In a randomized and sham-controlled experiment, neuronavigation-guided rTMS was applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and fMRI and functional connectivity analyses [seeded connectivity and psychophysiological interaction (PPI)] were used as readouts. Moreover, the test-retest reliability of working-memory related connectivity markers was evaluated. rTMS provoked a significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the right DLPFC and left hippocampus during working memory that proved to be relatively time-invariant and robust. PPI analyses provided evidence for a nominal effect of rTMS and poor test-retest reliability. No effects on n-back-related activation and DLPFC-hippocampus resting-state connectivity were observed.

Participants were required to perform an index finger flexion reaction time task in response to an auditory cue. In a series of experiments, SAI was evoked from the mixed, median nerve at the wrist or the cutaneous, digital nerve stimulation of the index finger. To assess the spinal versus cortical origin of movement-related modulation of SAI, F-wave amplitudes were measured during rest and the three movement components. Results indicated that SAI was reduced during all movement components compared to rest, an effect that occurred for both nerves stimulated. Pre-movement SAI reduction was primarily attributed to reduced cortical inhibition, while increased spinal excitability additionally contributed to reduced SAI during tonic and phasic components of movement.

Here we show, using fMRI and pattern classification methods, that the activity in the OTC also represents how stimuli will be interacted with by the body - a level of processing more traditionally associated with the preparatory activity in sensorimotor circuits of the brain. Combining functional mapping of different OTC areas with a real object-directed delayed movement task, we found that the pre-movement spatial activity patterns across the OTC could be used to predict both the action of an upcoming hand movement (grasping vs. reaching) and the effector (left hand vs. right hand) to be used.

Recently, cortical reorganization was demonstrated among patients with ligamentous injury; however, these neural changes have not been assessed relative to joint laxity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study is to determine if changes in cortical excitability and inhibition occur in subjects with functional ankle instability, and to investigate the relationship between these measures and joint laxity. DESIGN: Post-test only with control group. SETTING: University laboratory. PATIENTS: Twelve subjects with no history of ankle sprain (CON) and twelve subjects with a history of unilateral functional ankle instability (UNS). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were tested for joint laxity using an instrumented ankle arthrometer. Cortical excitability and inhibition were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to obtain motor evoked potentials and the cortical silent period from the lower leg muscles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Joint laxity was quantified as peak anterior displacement and inversion rotation. Active motor threshold (AMT), slope and intensity at 50% of peak slope (I50) of TMS-derived recruitment curves were used to quantify cortical excitability from lower leg muscles, while the cortical silent period (CSP) from the peroneus longus was used to represent intracortical inhibition. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between groups for laxity or cortical measures. CON demonstrated a significant relationship between laxity and TA excitability, as well as laxity and silent period; while UNS ankles demonstrated significant relationships between peroneal and soleus excitability and laxity measures. CONCLUSION: Our results support relationships between laxity and measures of excitability and inhibition that differ among healthy and unstable subjects. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms behind these findings and consider cortical influences when investigating altered joint laxity.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Exercise-induced strengthening of inter-digital connections in musicians.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "1416805", "authors": ["Kang, SY", "Hallett, M", "Sohn, YH"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Increased attentional demand has been shown to reduce motor performance, leading to increases in accidents, particularly in elderly populations.

This mini-review initially discusses past behavioral research, before moving to studies investigating corticomotor areas in response to changes in attention. Recent dual task studies have revealed a possible decline in the ability of older, but not younger, adults to activate inhibitory processes within the motor cortex, which may be correlated with poor motor performance, and thus accidents.

Neuropathic pain often follows spinal cord injury (SCI). OBJECTIVE: . To compare the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over different motor cortex targets (hand vs leg area) versus sham stimulation on neuropathic pain and local neurophysiological changes in patients with SCI. METHODS: . A total of 16 patients with complete or incomplete motor SCI and chronic neuropathic pain participated in a double-blind, cross-over randomized study. Three single sessions of sham or active rTMS (10 Hz, total of 2000 stimuli) were applied in random order over the hand or leg area with a minimal 2-week interval. The MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: were the numeric rating scale for pain sensation and parameters derived from motor mapping of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, including maximal amplitude of evoked response as well as map area, volume, and location. RESULTS: . rTMS applied to either the hand or the leg area, but not sham stimulation, induced a significant but equivalent reduction in pain for the first 48 hours postintervention (P < .05). Participants with an incomplete lesion showed greater analgesia than those with a complete lesion (21% vs 3%, respectively; P < .05). The main change observed for motor map measurements was an increase in corticospinal excitability after stimulation of the hand area (P = .04) but not for the other conditions.

Ultimately, TMS measures of plasticity can become the foundation for a brain health index (BHI) to enable objective correlates of an individual's brain health over time, assessment across diseases and disorders, and reliable evaluation of indicators of efficacy of future preventive and therapeutic interventions.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "146", "title": "Reduction of cortical GABAergic inhibition correlates with working memory impairment in recent onset schizophrenia.", "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "17553420", "authors": ["Takahashi, S", "Ukai, S", "Kose, A", "Hashimoto, T", "Iwatani, J", "Okumura, M", "Tsuji, T", "Shinosaki, K"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Schizophrenia research", "abstract": "Changes in cortical excitability during motor imagery were investigated in order to reveal the effect of hand dominance.

Patients with OSA show altered brain structure and function that may manifest as impaired neuroplasticity. We assessed this hypothesis in 13 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA and 11 healthy control subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to induce and measure neuroplastic changes in the motor cortex by assessing changes in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a hand muscle. Baseline measurements of cortical excitability included active (AMT) and resting motor thresholds (RMT), and the maximal stimulator output producing a 1-mV MEP. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) was investigated with short- and long-interval ICI paradigms (SICI and LICI, respectively), and neuroplastic changes were induced using continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS). At baseline, differences were found between groups for RMT (9.5% maximal stimulator output higher in OSA) and 1-mV MEPs (10.3% maximal stimulator output higher in OSA), but not AMT. No differences were found between groups for SICI or LICI. The response to cTBS was different between groups, with control subjects showing an expected reduction in MEP amplitude after cTBS, whereas the MEPs in patients with OSA did not change. The lack of response to cTBS suggests impaired long-term depression-like neuroplasticity in patients with OSA, which may be a consequence of sleep fragmentation or chronic blood gas disturbance in sleep. This reduced neuroplastic capacity may have implications for the learning, retention or consolidation of motor skills in patients with OSA.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "76", "title": "Efficient and robust identification of cortical targets in concurrent TMS-fMRI experiments.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16595189", "authors": ["Yau, JM", "Hua, J", "Liao, DA", "Desmond, JE"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Abstract We aimed to investigate whether motor learning induces different excitability changes in the human motor cortex (M1) between two different muscle contraction states (before voluntary contraction [static] or during voluntary contraction [dynamic]). For the same, using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we compared excitability changes during these two states after pinch-grip motor skill learning. The participants performed a force output tracking task by pinch grip on a computer screen. TMS was applied prior to the pinch grip (static) and after initiation of voluntary contraction (dynamic). MEPs of the following muscles were recorded: first dorsal interosseous (FDI), thenar muscle (Thenar), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles. During both the states, motor skill training led to significant improvement of motor performance. During the static state, MEPs of the FDI muscle were significantly facilitated after motor learning; however, during the dynamic state, MEPs of the FDI, Thenar, and FCR muscles were significantly decreased.

Why is this so? It has been suggested that proactive gaze when viewing a given hand action depends on the recruitment of motor areas such as the ventral premotor (PMv) cortex that would be involved in the execution of that action. However, direct evidence for a distinctive role of the PMv cortex in driving gaze behavior is still lacking. We recorded eye moments while viewing hand actions before and immediately after delivering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left PMv and the posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus, which is known to be involved in high-order visual action processing. Our results showed that rTMS-induced effects were selective with respect to the viewed actions following the virtual lesion of the left PMv only. This, for the first time, provides direct evidence that the PMv cortex might selectively contribute to driving the viewer's gaze to the action's target. When people view another's action, their eyes may be driven by motor processes similar to those they would need to perform the action themselves.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "75", "title": "Interregional compensatory mechanisms of motor functioning in progressing preclinical neurodegeneration.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17260171", "authors": ["Scheller, E", "Abdulkadir, A", "Peter, J", "Tabrizi, SJ", "Frackowiak, RS", "Kl\u00f6ppel, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Major depression is one of the leading causes of disabling condition worldwide and its treatment is often challenging and unsatisfactory, since many patients become refractory to pharmacological therapies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive neurophysiological investigation mainly used to study the integrity of the primary motor cortex excitability and of the cortico-spinal tract. The development of paired-pulse and repetitive TMS (rTMS) paradigms has allowed investigators to explore the pathophysiology of depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases linked to brain excitability dysfunctions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has also therapeutic and rehabilitative capabilities since it is able to induce changes in the excitability of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal networks that may persist in time. However, the therapeutic effects of rTMS on major depression have been demonstrated by analyzing only the improvement of neuropsychological performance. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical excitability changes on 12 chronically-medicated depressed patients (test group) after rTMS treatment and to correlate neurophysiological findings to neuropsychological outcomes. In detail, we assessed different parameters of cortical excitability before and after active rTMS in the test group, then compared to those of 10 age-matched depressed patients (control group) who underwent sham rTMS. In line with previous studies, at baseline both groups exhibited a significant interhemispheric difference of motor cortex excitability. This neurophysiological imbalance was then reduced in the patients treated with active rTMS, resulting also in a clinical benefit as demonstrated by the improvement in neuropsychological test scores. On the contrary, after sham rTMS, the interhemispheric difference was still evident in the control group. The reported clinical benefits in the test group might be related to the plastic remodeling of synaptic connection induced by rTMS treatment.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Brain stimulation studies of non-motor cerebellar function: a systematic review.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "18815249", "authors": ["Tomlinson, SP", "Davis, NJ", "Bracewell, RM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews", "abstract": "Visual selection requires mechanisms for representing object salience and for shifting the focus of processing to novel objects.
