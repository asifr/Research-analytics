One explanation accounting for deficits in the exploration of contralateral space following a unilateral hemispheric lesion refers to a loss of the normal interhemispheric balance, with a resultant hyperactivation of the unaffected hemisphere due to the release of reciprocal inhibition by the affected one. In order to verify this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a TMS-induced transient dysfunction of the normal hemisphere upon contralateral tactile extinctions in two groups: (i) 14 right brain-damaged patients and (ii) 14 left brain-damaged control patients. Single-pulse TMS was delivered to frontal and parietal scalp sites of the unaffected hemisphere after an interval of 40 ms from an electrical unimanual or bimanual digit stimulation. In right brain-damaged patients, left frontal TMS significantly reduced the rate of contralateral extinctions compared with controls. After left parietal TMS, the number of extinctions was comparable to the baseline. This pattern of increased sensitivity to cutaneous stimulation ipsilateral to TMS was not observed in left brain-damaged control patients. In this group, right hemisphere TMS did not significantly alter the recognition of bimanual stimuli delivered to the space contralateral to the lesion. The suggestion is made that extinctions produced by right brain damage may be dependent on a breakdown in the balance of hemispheric rivalry in directing spatial attention to contralateral hemispace, so that the unaffected hemisphere generates an unopposed orienting response to the side of the lesion.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether TMS could detect an asymmetrical hemispheric specialization in the sensory perception of unimanual and bimanual, ipsilateral and contralateral sensory stimuli. At each interpulse interval, the right parietal cortex was significantly more sensitive to TMS interference with stimulus detection for both contralateral and ipsilateral stimuli compared with the left parietal cortex.

Our results are indicative of an interhemispheric difference in the detection of cutaneous sensation, showing right hemispheric prevalence in the perception of contralateral as well as of ipsilateral stimuli.

Forty-nine patients with Parkinson's disease were divided into four groups, each given one stimulus, repeated 30 times, once or twice a day ( approximately 0.34Tesla (T), approximately 0.57T, approximately 0.80T). Patients were followed for 3 months and assessed using two different parkinsonian scales: the graded clinical rating scale and Unified Parkinson Disability Rating Scale (UPDRS), and with a short-term memory test (Ziehen-Ranschburg word pair test). No effect was seen in the group treated with approximately 0.34T\\30 stimuli once a day. In all of the groups receiving TMS twice a day, the parkinsonian scores were significantly decreased compared with that of baselines after 1 month of treatment. The greatest improvement in the hypokinesia was detected in the group treated with approximately 0.57T\\30 stimuli twice a day (baseline total UPDRS: 30.62 +/- 15.23; 1 month after treatment: 17.08 +/- 7.04, P < 0.01; 3 months after treatment: 16.08 +/- 7.06, P < 0.01).

Following voluntary movements, there are two phases of increased corticospinal excitability from 0 to approximately 100 ms and from approximately 100 to 160 ms after EMG offset. The first phase may correspond to the frontal peak of motor potential in movement-related cortical potentials studies and the movement-evoked magnetic field I (MEFI) in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies, and likely represents a time when decreasing output from the motor cortex falls below that required for activation of spinal motoneurons, but is still above resting levels. The second phase of increased corticospinal excitability may be due to peripheral proprioceptive inputs or may be centrally programmed representing a subthreshold, second agonist burst. This may correspond to the MEFII in MEG studies. Corticospinal excitability was reduced below baseline levels from about 500 to 1,000 ms after EMG offset, similar to the timing of increase in the power (event-related synchronization, ERS) of motor cortical rhythm. Similarly, motor cortex excitability is reduced at the time of ERS of motor cortical rhythm following median nerve stimulation.

Movement kinematics and EMG activity in antagonistic forearm muscles were analysed. In the ballistic task, repetitive TMS had little effect on the velocity or acceleration of the initial segment of the movement, although it induced large terminal oscillations (tremor) around the target position at frequencies between 4.4 and 7.2 Hz. The likelihood that tremor would occur increased with increasing stimulus intensities or frequencies. It was maximal with stimulation over the forearm area, and decreased with stimulation over the leg area, or over parietal sites; there was no tremor during stimulation of cervical nerve roots. The frequency of the induced tremor was independent of the rate of stimulation and did not depend on the presence of excitatory and inhibitory motor responses to the stimulus. Stimulation could also induce tremor of the same frequency in the fixed task, but only during co-contraction of forearm muscles. The amplitude of tremor was proportional to the level of co-contraction. Clinically, the tremor induced by repetitive TMS appeared very similar to cerebellar tremors. In order to confirm this we investigated two cerebellar patients, one with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and the other with multiple sclerosis. Both of them had a terminal tremor of 6-7 Hz in the wrist movement task. In the holding task, the amplitude of their postural tremor increased with the level of co-contraction in forearm muscles. Since the frequency of repetitive TMS-induced tremor was independent of stimulus parameters, we conclude that it represents some intrinsic property of the CNS. We suggest that the tremor is caused by disruption of cortical processes involved in terminating a voluntary movement or maintaining a posture. Similarities to cerebellar patients suggest that repetitive TMS may cause tremor by interfering with adaptive cerebellar afferent inflow to motor cortex.

Because large changes occur in the muscle action potential, we tested whether changes in the response to stimulation of the peripheral motor nerve could fully account for the increase in the MEP. Subjects (n=8) performed sustained maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the right elbow flexors for 2 min. During the contraction, the MEP and the response to supramaximal stimulation of motor-nerve fibres in the brachial plexus were alternately recorded. During the contraction, responses to motor-nerve stimulation increased in area by 87+/-35% (mean+/-SD) in the biceps brachii and 74+/-30% in the brachioradialis, but the area of the MEPs increased by 153+/-86% and 175+/-122%, respectively. Thus, the increase in the MEP was greater than the increase in the peripheral M-wave. The onset latency of the MEP in the biceps brachii increased by 0.7+/-0.6 ms (range: -0.2 to 1.9 ms) during the sustained contraction. A smaller increase occurred in response to peripheral nerve stimulation (0.3+/-0.3 ms; from -0.3 to 0.9 ms). In the contralateral elbow flexors, neither responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation nor responses to motor-nerve stimulation changed in size or latency. During the sustained contraction, the short silent period after stimulation of the peripheral nerve (48+/-5 ms in biceps brachii and 48+/-4 ms in brachioradialis) increased in duration by about 12 ms (to 61+/-12 ms and 60+/-9 ms, respectively), whereas the silent period following transcranial magnetic stimulation increased from 238+/-39 ms in biceps brachii and 243+/-34 ms in brachioradialis to 325+/-41 ms and 343+/-42 ms, respectively. During a sustained MVC, while the motor responses to peripheral and to cortical stimulation grow concurrently, growth of the MEP cannot be entirely accounted for by changes in the muscle action potential. Hence, some of the increase in MEP size during fatigue must reflect changes in the central nervous system. Increased latency of the MEPs and lengthening of the peripherally evoked silent period are consistent with decreased excitability of the alpha motoneurone pool. Thus, an increased response from the motor cortex to the magnetic stimulus remains a likely contributor to the increase in the size of the MEP in fatigue.", "pages": "205-10"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Psychiatry].", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9402583", "authors": ["Manes, F", "Crespo-Facorro, B"], "year": "", "journal": "Actas espa\u00f1olas de psiquiatr\u00eda", "abstract": "Seven subjects reacted to an auditory stimulus by pressing a response key and judged their reaction time (RT) by reporting the position of a rotating clock-hand at which they pressed the key.

EMPs were studied in tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GM), and abductor digiti minimi (AD) muscles during treadmill walking.

EMP facilitation proved to be modulated throughout the stride cycle when normalising EMP with respect to the underlying electromyogram (EMG). Facilitation was strongest in TA prior to the swing phase. Significant differences of EMP facilitation between the visual and control tasks were present. In the visual task, maximal facilitation of TA EMPs prior to and during the swing phase was decreased compared to the control task. Conversely, there was increased facilitation of GM EMPs during swing phase of the visual task, prior to the heel strike and prior to the plantarflexion, which was the moment when the target was hit.

However, evidence exists to suggest that afferent input may be, at least in part, responsible for the reduction in inhibition. The experiments described here were designed to investigate this possibility further. The results of these experiments showed that afferent input, produced by electrical peripheral-nerve stimulation, reduced the level of intracortical inhibition. Also, motor imagery, which activates similar brain regions as overt movement, but does not result in afferent input, failed to produce significant changes in intracortical inhibition.

Growing evidence points toward involvement of the human motor cortex in the control of the ipsilateral hand. We used focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the pathways of these ipsilateral motor effects. 2. Ipsilateral motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained in hand and arm muscles of all 10 healthy adult subjects tested. They occurred in the finger and wrist extensors and the biceps, but no response or inhibitory responses were observed in the opponens pollicis, finger and wrist flexors and the triceps. 3. The production of ipsilateral MEPs required contraction of the target muscle. The threshold TMS intensity for ipsilateral MEPs was on average 1.8 times higher, and the onset was 5.7 ms later (in the wrist extensor muscles) compared with size-matched contralateral MEPs. 4. The corticofugal pathways of ipsilateral and contralateral MEPs could be dissociated through differences in cortical map location and preferred stimulating current direction. 5. Both ipsi- and contralateral MEPs in the wrist extensors increased with lateral head rotation toward, and decreased with head rotation away from, the side of the TMS, suggesting a privileged input of the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex to the pathway of the ipsilateral MEP. 6. Large ipsilateral MEPs were obtained in a patient with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. 7. The dissociation of the pathways for ipsilateral and contralateral MEPs indicates that corticofugal motor fibres other than the fast-conducting crossed corticomotoneuronal system can be activated by TMS. Our data suggest an ipsilateral oligosynaptic pathway, such as a corticoreticulospinal or a corticopropriospinal projection as the route for the ipsilateral MEP. Other pathways, such as branching of corticomotoneuronal axons, a transcallosal projection or a slow-conducting monosynaptic ipsilateral pathway are very unlikely or can be excluded.", "pages": "205-10"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Differential inhibition of chromatic and achromatic perception by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human visual cortex.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "9696383", "authors": ["Paulus, W", "Korinth, S", "Wischer, S", "Tergau, F"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "1. To help clarify the use of measurements of 'excitability', a simple model motoneurone receiving noisy tonic background excitation was tested with brief stimuli. Its response was determined from its PSTH (post-stimulus time histogram). The tonic background was varied from well below to well above the threshold for tonic firing. The conclusions should apply to many other neurones. 2. The response of the model to a stimulus depended upon a number of factors, including stimulus strength, synaptic membrane noise and especially whether or not the background drive elicited tonic firing. With the onset of firing, the shape of the stimulus-response curve changed drastically and the model then responded to the smallest stimulus without a threshold. When the drive was subthreshold, increasing the background excitation always increased the response to a given stimulus. However, what happened when the tonic drive exceeded the threshold for tonic firing depended upon the stimulus strength. With weak stimuli, the response increased with the drive to reach a plateau level where it was independent of the background firing rate; this occurred for stimuli comparable in size to the synaptic noise. With stronger stimuli, the response rose to a maximum for very low firing rates, but then decreased by up to 50 % to a plateau for high firing rates. Increasing the membrane noise reduced or abolished the maximum. 3. The model was also used to simulate a monosynaptic conditioning-testing paradigm. The effect of a given conditioning stimulus was then found to change with the onset of firing, including when the strength of the testing stimulus was adjusted to make the size of the test response the same in the presence and absence of firing. 4. The behaviour of real motoneurones can be expected to be at least as complex with the transition from silence to firing, so H reflex and other tests of 'excitability' must then be treated with caution. In particular, as has been observed experimentally, the response of a unit may decrease with increasing background excitation, as well as with inhibition. 5. Transferring the findings to corticospinal neurones makes it unlikely that the magnitude of the descending volley elicited by a given cortical stimulus ('excitability') will always increase with the initial level of cortical activity. In addition, the appreciable threshold for transcranial magnetic stimulation during voluntary contraction suggests that it first excites axons rather than the neural pacemakers.", "pages": "205-10"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "Modulation of intracortical excitability for different muscles in the upper extremity: paired magnetic stimulation study with focal versus non-focal coils.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9705480", "authors": ["Shimizu, T", "Filippi, MM", "Palmieri, MG", "Oliveri, M", "Vernieri, F", "Pasqualetti, P", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Human handedness may be associated with asymmetry in the corticospinal motor system.

We therefore undertook this investigation to test the hypothesis that handedness is associated with asymmetry in cortical motor representations. We used TMS to map contralateral cortical motor representations of the right and left abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles in nine normal subjects (three left-handed).

However, we observed that the number of scalp stimulation sites eliciting MEPs was statistically greater for APB and FCR muscles of the preferred limb. We found significant asymmetry between right-handed and left-handed subjects, such that in right-handers, the representation of the right APB was larger than that of the left APB, but in left-handers the representation of right APB was smaller than that of the left APB.

In 4 subjects, MEPs evoked by transcranial electric stimulation or by TMS during slight muscle contraction showed a comparable trigeminomotor inhibition. These findings demonstrate that electromagnetic stimulation of trigeminal afferents interferes with the motor output to the intrinsic hand muscles inducing a bilateral inhibition which is probably mediated by a multisynaptic subcortical network. In all 6 subjects, TMS over the motor hand area or the cerebellum elicited a reproducible blink reflex. Since the blink reflex is a sensitive indicator of trigeminal excitation, one has to assume that TMS is associated with a significant excitation of trigeminal afferents. Therefore, trigeminomotor inhibition has to be considered in all TMS studies that use a conditioning-test design.", "pages": "205-10"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "A method to monitor motor cortical excitability in human stroke through motor evoked potentials.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "2731025", "authors": ["Traversa, R", "Cicinelli, P", "Filippi, M", "Oliveri, M", "Palmieri, MG", "Pasqualetti, P", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Brain research.
