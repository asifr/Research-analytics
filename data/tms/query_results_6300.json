However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of rTMS are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed mRNA expression changes of monoamine transporter (MAT) genes, which are targets for antidepressants and psychostimulants. Following a 20-day rTMS treatment, these genes were found to be differentially expressed in the mouse brain. Down-regulation of serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA levels and the subsequent decrease in serotonin uptake and binding were observed after chronic rTMS. In contrast to the SERT changes, increased mRNA levels of dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) were observed. For NET, but not DAT, there were accompanying changes in uptake and binding. Similar effect on NET was observed in PC12 cells stimulated by rTMS for 15 days. These results indicate that modulation of MATs by chronic rTMS may be one therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Exploring the contributions of premotor and parietal cortex to spatial compatibility using image-guided TMS.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15627572", "authors": ["Koski, L", "Molnar-Szakacs, I", "Iacoboni, M"], "year": "2005", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated increased activity in dorsal premotor and posterior parietal cortex when performing spatial stimulus-response compatibility tasks (SRC).

TMS over the left premotor cortex produced various facilitatory effects, depending on the timing of the stimulation. At short intervals, TMS appeared to prime the left dorsal premotor cortex to select a right-hand response more quickly, regardless of stimulus-response compatibility. The strongest effect of stimulation, however, occurred at the 200-ms interval, when TMS facilitated left-hand responses during the incompatible condition.

It consisted of two phases. In a group of ten healthy subjects, single and paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex was used to study the behavior of the resulting motor evoked potentials (MEP) in lower-limb muscles. Interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 15-100 ms were examined for augmentation of test MEPs by threshold or subthreshold conditioning stimuli. The second phase of this study examined eight incomplete spinal cord injured (iSCI) subjects, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale C (n = 5) and D (n = 3) in whom voluntary motor control was quantified using the surface EMG (sEMG) based Voluntary Response Index (VRI). The VRI is calculated to characterize relative output patterns across ten lower-limb muscles recorded during a standard protocol of elementary voluntary motor tasks. VRI components were calculated by comparing the distribution of sEMG in iSCI subjects with prototype patterns collected from 15 healthy subjects using the same rigidly administered protocol, The resulting similarity index (SI) and magnitude values provided the measure of voluntary motor control. Corticospinal system connections were characterized by the thresholds for MEPs in key muscles. Key muscles were those that function as the prime-movers, or agonists for the voluntary movements from which the VRI data were calculated. Results include healthy-subject data that showed significant increases in conditioned MEP responses with paired stimuli of 15-50 ms ISI. Stimulus pairs of 75 and 100 ms showed no increase in MEP peak amplitude over that of the single-pulse conditioning stimulus alone, usually no response. For the iSCI subjects, 42% of the agonists responded to single-pulse TMS and 25% required paired-pulse TMS to produce an MEP. American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale component motor scores for agonist muscles, Quadriceps, Tibialis Anterior, and Triceps Surae, were significantly lower where MEPs could not be obtained (p < 0.05). VRI values were also significantly lower for motor tasks with agonists that had no resting MEP (p < 0.01).

Seven subjects made brief (2-3 s) and sustained (2 min) MVCs of elbow flexor muscles in two experiments. Core temperature was normal (approximately 37 degrees C) in the first experiment, and elevated (approximately 38.5 degrees C) by passive heating in the second. During some MVCs, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex (TMS) was delivered, and the evoked torque (superimposed twitch) and EMG responses were measured. During hyperthermia, voluntary torque was reduced by approximately 2.4% during brief MVCs (P = 0.03), and decreased further (approximately 12%) during sustained MVCs (P = 0.01). The superimposed twitch amplitude in the sustained MVC was approximately 50% larger (P = 0.01). Thus, the ability to drive the muscle maximally in a sustained fashion was decreased, and some motor cortical output, which could have increased torque, remained untapped by voluntary drive. The additional central fatigue was not associated with altered motor cortical 'excitability', as EMG responses produced by TMS were similar at the two temperatures. However, the peak relaxation rate of muscle increased by approximately 20% (P = 0.005) during hyperthermia. Hence, faster motor unit firing rates would be required to produce fusion of force.

These observations suggest that the depression of the H-reflex by rTMS can be explained, at least partly, by an increased presynaptic inhibition of soleus Ia afferents. In contrast, rTMS had no effect on disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition from ankle dorsiflexors to plantarflexors.

In a first experiment, we gave 1500 stimuli of 5 Hz rTMS. At an intensity of 90% of active motor threshold, rTMS produced no effect on MEP amplitude at rest. Increasing the intensity to 90% of resting motor threshold (RMT), rTMS produced an increase in MEP amplitude.

In a second experiment, MEPs were elicited during tonic contraction using weak anodal electrical or magnetic test stimuli. 1500 (but not 600) conditioning stimuli at 90% of RMT induced a facilitation of MEPs in the contracting FDI muscle.

Moreover, it became clear that the preparatory motor sets offer a privileged window to investigate the interaction between cognitive and sensorimotor function in the motor cortex. In the present review, we examine how the study of the preparatory motor sets anticipating a mechanical movement perturbation contributes to enlightening this question. Following the initial observation made by Hammond that some components of the stretch reflex can be modulated by a prior intention either to resist or to relax in response to a subsequent perturbation, first evidence of the phenomenon was obtained in behaving monkeys. Moreover, this study related this peripheral fact to the observed anticipatory activity of motor cortex neurons after a prior instruction telling the animal how to respond to the subsequent perturbation, which triggered the instructed movement. Indeed, this anticipatory activity was found to be different according to the instruction. In the 1980s, this work inspired a lot of studies in human beings that brought support to the idea of a cognitive tuning of the long latency stretch response (LLSR). Specifically, the MI component of the response was shown to be modulated by a prior intent to resist versus to let go when faced with the perturbation. Recently, new approaches have been developed to obtain evidence of a cognitive tuning of CS excitability, thanks to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS has been used both as a reliable tool for quantifying the CS excitability via the motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and to centrally perturb the organization of movement. Such central perturbations offer the unique opportunity to activate the descending motor tracts while shunting, for a short time period, the ascending tracts assisting the movement. Thus, CS excitability was measured before the movement was perturbed. These studies demonstrated the readiness of the CS tract to be involved in anticipatory compensatory responses to central movement perturbations induced by TMS in relation to the subject's cognitive attitudes. The question of the cerebral regions upstream of the motor cortex that could be responsible for this modulation in CS excitability remains largely open.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "160", "title": "Excitability of the motor cortical representation of the external anal sphincter.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "6889502", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In 8 subjects TMS was concurrently applied to the motor cortex of each hemisphere using 2 figure-8 coils. MEPs (n = 50) were recorded from left and right first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and extensor digitorum communis. At rest, MEPs were significantly positively correlated for pairs of muscles of the same (75% of comparisons) and opposite limb (56% of comparisons). The correlation for within-limb muscle pairs was strongest for FDI and ADM. In contrast, between-limb MEP correlations showed no somatotopic organization. Voluntary activation reduced the strength of MEP correlations between limbs, even for muscle pairs that remained at rest while a remote upper limb muscle was active. In contrast, activation of a remote muscle did not affect the strength of MEP correlation for muscle pairs within the same limb that remained at rest. For within-limb comparisons, activation of one or both muscles of a pair reduced the strength of the MEP correlation, but to a lesser extent than for between-limb pairs. It is concluded that the process linking corticospinal excitability in the two hemispheres is suppressed during voluntary activation, and that different processes contribute to common fluctuations in MEP size for muscles within the same limb.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "What do we know about how humans cough?", "issue": "6", "pmid": "6891306", "authors": ["Fong, J", "Sandhu, G", "Ellaway, P", "Davey, N", "Strutton, P", "Murphy, K", "Guz, A"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics", "abstract": "To investigate the effects of task-specific practice on hand function in stroke subjects who were given computer-assisted training and to look for associated changes in corticospinal connectivity.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in children and adolescents: a review and report of two cases of epilepsia partialis continua.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "4077800", "authors": ["Morales, OG", "Henry, ME", "Nobler, MS", "Wassermann, EM", "Lisanby, SH"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America", "abstract": "Single case design experiments.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Emerging brain-based interventions for children and adolescents: overview and clinical perspective.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "3621076", "authors": ["Hirshberg, LM", "Chiu, S", "Frazier, JA"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America", "abstract": "Subjects' homes.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Interhemispheric transmission of visuomotor information for motor implementation.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "10561405", "authors": ["Terao, Y", "Furubayashi, T", "Okabe, S", "Arai, N", "Mochizuki, H", "Kobayashi, S", "Yumoto, M", "Nishikawa, M", "Iwata, NK", "Ugawa, Y"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Seven chronic stroke subjects with impaired hand function.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Reorganization in congenital hemiparesis acquired at different gestational ages.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "3079553", "authors": ["Staudt, M", "Gerloff, C", "Grodd, W", "Holthausen, H", "Niemann, G", "Kr\u00e4geloh-Mann, I"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Daily intensive practice of fast and accurate force changes in pinch grip and knob turning grip for four weeks.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "65 Suppl 14", "title": "A qualitative analysis of nonresponse: management of treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "issue": "", "pmid": "3443940", "authors": ["Pallanti, S", "Hollander, E", "Goodman, WK"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The Journal of clinical psychiatry", "abstract": "Pinch and power grip strength and dexterity measured using the Ten-hole Peg Test and a timed nuts and bolts test were recorded twice a week throughout the study.

If a patient has been treated for several months and has not yet responded to treatment with several SRIs, the physician should perform a careful assessment of resistant and/or residual clinical symptoms and any comorbid conditions to determine which next-step treatment would be the most appropriate. One strategy for patients who have not responded to treatment with an SRI is to switch them to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, because some patients may respond better to agents that target multiple systems. Another promising approach is the augmentation of SRIs with neuroleptics. In addition, open trials have shown that intravenous (IV) clomipramine and IV citalopram may be effective in the treatment of resistant OCD. Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments and electroconvulsive therapy have been attempted, with mixed success. Recently, researchers have been studying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and neurosurgical approaches such as gamma knife capsulotomy and deep brain stimulation to learn if these procedures are effective in treating treatment-resistant OCD.

Magnetic stimulation of the radial nerve and, in normal subjects, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex were used to produce weak brief non-voluntary twitches. In estimation tasks, the subjects had to ascribe verbal marks on a 1-5 scale to the forces of stimulation-induced twitches. Loose covariations of marks and forces were observed, while directions of force variations between successive twitches were relatively well detected. GL did less well than normal subjects in detecting directions of force variations. In production tasks, subjects had to produce twitches matching verbal command marks in a 1-5 range, with or without visual feedback. Performances of normal subjects and GL resembled those of estimation tasks and were not improved by visual feedback. In reproduction tasks, subjects had to duplicate stimulation-induced test twitches: first without visual feedback, second with and third again without.

In the third step, improvement with respect to the first one was significantly more marked with TMS than with peripheral stimulation. GL improved her performance in the third step, possibly because she could use information provided by group III and group IV afferents still present in her nerves. Altogether, for normal subjects (1) the performances in estimation tasks are consistent with the known behaviour of Golgi tendon organs as observed in animal experiments, and (2) results observed in reproduction tasks suggest that cortical stimulation might elicit, in addition to corticospinal activation of motoneurones, collateral discharges that could be stored as a memory of motor command.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals abnormal plastic response to premotor cortex stimulation in schizophrenia.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "15911832", "authors": ["Oxley, T", "Fitzgerald, PB", "Brown, TL", "de Castella, A", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "Kulkarni, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Several lines of evidence indicate that motor cortex excitability can be modulated by manipulation of afferent inputs, like peripheral electrical stimulation.

To investigate the possible effects of high-frequency peripheral stimulation on motor cortical excitability we recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left motor cortex from the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) in normal subjects, before and after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of 30 min duration applied over the FCR. The amplitude of MEPs from the FRC was significantly reduced from 10 to 35 min after TENS while the amplitude of MEPs from ECR was increased. No effects were observed in the FDI muscle. Indices of peripheral nerve (M-wave) and spinal cord excitability (H waves) did not change throughout the experiment. Electrical stimulation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve has no significant effect on motor cortex excitability. These findings suggest that TENS of forearm muscles can induce transient reciprocal inhibitory and facilitatory changes in corticomotoneuronal excitability of forearm flexor and extensor muscles lasting several minutes. These changes probably may occur at cortical site and seem to be mainly dependent on stimulation of muscle afferents.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at a range of intensities was applied to obtain a recruitment curve of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle before and after training. We also explored the effect of training on inhibitory and facilitatory cortical circuits by using a paired-pulse TMS technique at intervals of 2.5 ms (short-interval intracortical inhibition, SICI) and 8 ms (intracortical facilitation, ICF). During motor skill training, subjects were instructed to make a cursor follow a series of target lines on a computer screen by performing voluntary ankle dorsi- and plantarflexion movements. Non-skill and passive training consisted of repeated voluntary and assisted dorsi- and plantarflexion movements, respectively. Recruitment curves increased significantly after 32 min of motor skill training but not after non-skill and passive training, suggesting that only skill motor training increases motor cortical excitability. Motor skill training was not accompanied by any changes in the recruitment curves of TA MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation, suggesting that the increased MEPs to TMS was likely caused by changes in excitability at a cortical site. SICI was decreased after 32 min of motor skill training but no changes were observed in ICF. We conclude that similar plastic changes as have previously been reported for the hand motor following motor skill training may also be observed for the leg motor area.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method which involves placing an electromagnetic coil on the scalp. A pulse generates a magnetic field and this one passes, unattenuated by the skin and scalp, into the cortex inducing a current which results in neural activity. The technique shows a good temporal resolution and, moreover, because it represents an interference technique, can be said to have excellent functional resolution. For this reason, TMS appears to be a new tool for research in neuropsychology, producing transitory 'virtual lesion'effects which could help to understand how, when and where cognitive tasks are performed. The purpose of this article is to review recent research using TMS in cognition and neuropsychology, in a non exhaustive way. In safety studies, single TMS over motor cortex can produce simple movements. Several groups have applied TMS to the study of visual processing and found an impaired detection of visual stimuli. In a same way, TMS can disrupt speech when it was delivered in the language dominant hemisphere. Studies on the memory effects of TMS have been conflicting and the results seem to depend on the choice of paradigm and parameters. Other study depicted improvements in executive functioning after TMS on the left middle frontal gyrus or a diminution in reaction time during an analogic reasoning task. Moreover, some facial emotions seem to be less recognizable after TMS. Although TMS seem to be a new tool for neuro-psychological investigations in healthy subjects, few studies reported cognitive effects of rTMS treatment in psychiatry. In a therapeutic view, many of these trials have supported a significant effect of TMS, but in some studies the effect is small and short lived. Several groups have reported on the use of rTMS as a treatment in resistant major depression and the impact on cognition functioning. Most of results tend to find no adverse cognitive effects after several weeks of daily rTMS in depressed patients, compared to Electroconvulsivo-therapy (ECT). The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on hallucination severity and neurocognition were studied in a recent study.

Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the leg area of the motor cortex (MCx) was used to determine the time course of changes in motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) during the reaction time (RT). In one condition the voluntary contraction was superimposed on tonic EMG activity maintained at 10% of maximal voluntary contraction. In the other condition the voluntary contraction was made starting from rest. MEPs in the TA contralateral to the stimulation coil were evoked at various times during the RT in each condition. These were compared to the control MEPs evoked during tonic voluntary activity or with the subject at rest. The RT was measured trial by trial from the EMG activity of the TA ipsilateral to the magnetic stimulus, taking into account the nearly constant time difference between the two sides. The MEPs became far greater than control MEPs during the RT (mean = 332%, SD = 44 %, of control MEPs, P < 0.001) without any measurable change in the background level of EMG activity. The onset of this facilitation occurred on average 12.80 ms (SD = 7.55 ms) before the RT. There was no difference in the onset of facilitation between the two conditions. Because MEPs were facilitated without a change in the background EMG activity, it is concluded that this facilitation is specifically due to an increase of MCx excitability just before voluntary muscle activation. This conclusion is further reinforced by the observation that MEPs evoked by near-threshold anodal stimuli to the MCx were not facilitated during the RT, in contrast to those evoked by near-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, several observations in the present and previous studies indicate that MEP amplitude may be more sensitive to alpha-motoneuron activity than to motor cortical neuron activity, an idea that has important methodological implications.", "pages": "218-24"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Low-frequency repetitive TMS of premotor cortex can reduce painful axial spasms in generalized secondary dystonia: a pilot study of three patients.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "15563728", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP", "F\u00e9nelon, G", "M\u00e9nard-Lefaucheur, I", "Wendling, S", "Nguyen, JP"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the human primary motor cortex (M1) provides a means of inducing lasting changes in cortical excitability and synaptic activity. Here we combined rTMS with positron emission tomography of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to examine how an rTMS-induced change in intracortical excitability of inhibitory circuits affects regional synaptic activity. In a first set of experiments, we gave 150 biphasic pulses of 5 Hz rTMS at 90% of active motor threshold to left M1 and used single- and paired-pulse TMS to assess the conditioning effects of rTMS on motor cortical excitability at rest. rTMS conditioning led to a selective decrease in short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) without affecting short-latency intracortical facilitation or corticospinal excitability. The decrease in SICI lasted for approximately 8 min. In a second experiment, we used the same rTMS protocol and measured changes in regional synaptic activity (as indexed by rCBF) during and for up to 14 min after the end of rTMS. Subthreshold 5 Hz rTMS induced a region-specific increase in resting rCBF in the stimulated M1 lasting approximately 8 min. These results suggest that in the stimulated M1, temporary attenuation of SICI is paralleled by an increase in synaptic activity, consistent with reduced efficacy of intracortical GABA(A)-ergic synapses. The present findings demonstrate that short trains of low-intensity 5 Hz rTMS can be used to induce a transient change in function within a distinct cortical area.

We assessed this possibility by stimulating PPC with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects learned to make reaching movements with their right hand in a velocity-dependent force field. We reasoned that, if PPC is necessary to adjust the trajectory of the arm as it interacts with a novel mechanical system, interfering with the functioning of PPC would impair adaptation. Single pulses of TMS were applied over the left PPC 40 msec after the onset of movement during adaptation. As a control, another group of subjects was stimulated over the visual cortex. During early stages of learning, the magnitude of the error (measured as the deviation of the hand paths) was similar across groups. By the end of the learning period, however, error magnitudes decreased to baseline levels for controls but remained significantly larger for the group stimulated over PPC.
