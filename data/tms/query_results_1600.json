We used a novel explorative paradigm to map the origin of cortico-M1 pathways assessed by dual transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in three healthy participants. Subthreshold conditioning TMS (cTMS) was delivered over a grid of \u2248100 spots. Covering the left hemisphere, and was followed by suprathreshold test (tTMS) delivered over the ipsilateral M1. Grid points were tested eight times, with inter-stimulus intervals between cTMS and tTMS of 4 and 7\u2009ms. Participants were asked to stay relaxed with no particular task. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from cTMS\u2009+\u2009tTMS were normalized to MEPs from tTMS alone and were compared to the value expected from tTMS alone using t-statistics. The t-values from each grid point were then used to plot statistical maps. Several foci of significant cortico-M1 interactions were found in the dorsal-medial frontal cortex, in the ventral frontal cortex, in the superior and inferior parietal lobules and in the parietal operculum. The majority of active foci had inhibitory effects on corticospinal excitability. The spatial location of the network of different subjects overlapped but with some anatomical variation of single foci. TMS statistical mapping during the resting state revealed a complex inhibitory cortical network. The explorative approach to TMS as a brain mapping tool produced results that are self-standing in single subjects overcoming inter-individual variability of cortical active sites.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Utility of repetitive transcranial stimulation as an augmenting treatment method in treatment-resistant depression.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "22021964", "authors": ["Jhanwar, VG", "Bishnoi, RJ", "Jhanwar, MR"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Indian journal of psychological medicine", "abstract": "About 30 to 46% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to fully respond to initial antidepressants.

In an open-label study, 21 patients with DSM-IV MDD without psychotic features who had failed to respond to an adequate trial of at least 2 antidepressants were given rTMS therapy for 4 weeks, keeping the dose of pre-existing antidepressants unchanged. High-frequency (10 Hz) stimulations were delivered over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at intensity of 110% of patient's motor threshold. Treatment response was defined as a reduction in score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary efficacy measures included scores on the Clinical Global Impressions-Change and -Severity scales. At the end of 4 weeks, 19 patients completed the 4-week study and were assessed.

Stopping of this kind appears to have global effects on the motor system. For example, by delivering transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the leg area of the primary motor cortex, it is possible to detect suppression in the leg when the hand is being stopped (Badry R et al. Suppression of human cortico-motoneuronal excitability during the stop-signal task. Clin Neurophysiol 120: 1717-1723, 2009). Here, we asked if such \"global suppression\" can be observed proactively, i.e., when people anticipate they might have to stop. We used a conditional stop signal task, which allows the measurement of both an \"anticipation phase\" (i.e., where proactive control is applied) and a \"stopping\" phase. TMS was delivered during the anticipation phase (experiment 1) and also during the stopping phase (experiments 1 and 2) to measure leg excitability. During the anticipation phase, we did not observe leg suppression, but we did during the stopping phase, consistent with Badry et al. (2009). Moreover, when we split the subject groups into those who slowed down behaviorally (i.e., exercised proactive control) and those who did not, we found that subjects who slowed did not show leg suppression when they stopped, whereas those who did not slow did show leg suppression when they stopped. These results suggest that if subjects prepare to stop, then they do so without global effects on the motor system.

However, ppTMS protocols in rodent disease models, where mechanistic insight into the ppTMS physiology and into disease processes may be obtained, have been limited due to the requirement for anesthesia and needle electromyography. To eliminate the confounding factor of anesthesia and to approximate human ppTMS protocols in awake rats, we adapted the mechanomyogram (MMG) method to investigate the ppTMS inhibitory phenomenon in awake rats and then applied differential pharmacology to test the hypothesis that long-interval cortical inhibition is mediated by the GABA(A) receptor. Bilateral hindlimb-evoked MMGs were elicited in awake rats by long-interval ppTMS protocols with 50-, 100-, and 200-ms interstimulus intervals. Acute changes in ppTMS-MMG were measured before and after intraperitoneal injections of saline, the GABA(A) agonist pentobarbital (PB), and GABA(A) antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). An evoked MMG was obtained in 100% of animals by single-pulse stimulation, and ppTMS resulted in predictable inhibition of the test-evoked MMG. With increasing TMS intensity, MMG amplitudes increased in proportion to machine output to produce reliable input-output curves. Simultaneous recordings of electromyography and MMG showed a predictable latency discrepancy between the motor-evoked potential and the evoked MMG (7.55 \u00b1 0.08 and 9.16 \u00b1 0.14 ms, respectively). With pharmacological testing, time course observations showed that ppTMS-MMG inhibition was acutely reduced following PTZ (P < 0.05), acutely enhanced after PB (P < 0.01) injection, and then recovered to pretreatment baseline after 1 h. Our data support the application of the ppTMS-MMG technique for measuring the cortical excitability in awake rats and provide the evidence that GABA(A) receptor contributes to long-interval paired-pulse cortical inhibition. Thus ppTMS-MMG appears a well-tolerated biomarker for measuring GABA(A)-mediated cortical inhibition in rats.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "142", "title": "Targeting unlesioned pharyngeal motor cortex improves swallowing in healthy individuals and after dysphagic stroke.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21666129", "authors": ["Michou, E", "Mistry, S", "Jefferson, S", "Singh, S", "Rothwell, J", "Hamdy, S"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate corticospinal contributions to locomotor drive to leg muscles involved in cycling. We studied 1) if activation of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex via subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) caused a suppression of EMG and 2) how the responses to stimulation of the motor cortex via TMS and cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS) were modulated across the locomotor cycle. TMS at intensities subthreshold for activation of the corticospinal tract elicited suppression of EMG for approximately one-half of the subjects and muscles during cycling, and in matched static contractions in vastus lateralis. There was also significant modulation in the size of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS across the locomotor cycle (P < 0.001) that was strongly related to variation in background EMG in all muscles (r > 0.86; P < 0.05). When MEP and CMEP amplitudes were normalized to background EMG, they were relatively larger prior to the main EMG burst and smaller when background EMG was maximum. Since the pattern of modulation of normalized MEP and CMEP responses was similar, the data suggest that phase-dependent modulation of corticospinal responses during cycling in humans is driven mainly by spinal mechanisms. However, there were subtle differences in the degree to which normalized MEP and CMEP responses were facilitated prior to EMG burst, which might reflect small increases in cortical excitability prior to maximum muscle activation. The data demonstrate that the motor cortex contributes actively to locomotor drive, and that spinal factors dominate phase-dependent modulation of corticospinal excitability during cycling in humans.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Modulation of large-scale brain networks by transcranial direct current stimulation evidenced by resting-state functional MRI.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "12091558", "authors": ["Pe\u00f1a-G\u00f3mez, C", "Sala-Lonch, R", "Junqu\u00e9, C", "Clemente, IC", "Vidal, D", "Bargall\u00f3, N", "Falc\u00f3n, C", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Pascual-Leone, \u00c1", "Bartr\u00e9s-Faz, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Forty-five years of studies on magnetism and bioelectromagnetics, in our laboratory, are presented.

Alpha amplitude increase, on the other hand, can be found at ipsilateral visual cortex. There is some evidence suggesting an involvement of prefrontal brain areas during the control of attention-related anticipatory alpha amplitude asymmetry. This open question has been studied in detail using a multimodal approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy humans. Slow (1\u2009Hz) repetitive TMS leading to reduced excitability of the stimulation site was delivered either to right frontal eye field (FEF) or a control site (vertex). Subsequently, participants had to perform a spatial cuing task in which covert shifts of attention were required to either the left or the right visual hemi-field. After stimulation at the vertex (control condition) a pattern of anticipatory, attention-related ipsilateral alpha increase/contralateral alpha decrease over posterior recording sites could be obtained. Additionally, there was pronounced coupling between (in particular right) FEF and posterior brain sites at EEG alpha frequency. When, however, right prefrontal cortex had been virtually lesioned preceding the task, these EEG correlates of visuospatial attention were attenuated. Notably, the effect of TMS at the right FEF on interregional fronto-parietal alpha coupling predicted the effect of TMS on response times.

Interpretation of this finding is challenging as the mechanisms of 1 ms ISI SICI are not well understood, but we speculate that our results support the possibility that 1 ms ISI SICI reflects a distinct GABAergic inhibitory process, possibly that of extrasynaptic GABA tone.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Evaluation of differentiated neurotherapy programs for a patient after severe TBI and long term coma using event-related potentials.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "9474057", "authors": ["Pachalska, M", "\u0141ukowicz, M", "Kropotov, JD", "Herman-Sucharska, I", "Talar, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "abstract": "Previous studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have shown that advancing age may influence plasticity induction in human motor cortex (M1), but these changes have been assessed with TMS-induced paradigms or simple motor tasks.

Electromyographic recordings were obtained from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of 16 young (20-35 years) and 16 older (aged 60-75 years) adults before and after motor skill training. Motor training consisted of three 6-minute blocks of a complex visuomotor task that required matching the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint angle of the index finger using abduction-adduction movements. Single- and paired-pulse TMS over the left M1 was used to assess changes in right FDI motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) before and after each training block. Visuomotor tracking performance was diminished in old compared with young adults throughout training. However, improvement in tracking error was similar for young and old adults (7-24% increase in each training block). For young and old adults, motor training increased FDI MEP amplitude (\u2265 20%) and reduced the magnitude of SICI (\u2265 19%) after each visuomotor training block, reflecting use-dependent plasticity. However, no difference in corticomotor plasticity (change in MEP or SICI) was observed between young and old adults.

The current study elucidates whether the cortical motor command for dynamic contractions is also restricted to a certain population of cortical neurons responsible for the fast corticospinal projections. Therefore, corticospinal transmission was assessed with high temporal resolution during dynamic contractions after both, magnetic stimulation over M1 and the brainstem. The high temporal resolution could be obtained by conditioning the soleus H-reflex with different interstimulus intervals by cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS-conditioning) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 (M1-conditioning). This technique provides a precise time course of facilitation and inhibition. CMS- and M1-conditioning produced an 'early facilitation' of the H-reflex, which occurred around 3 ms earlier with CMS-conditioning. The early facilitation is believed to be caused by activation of direct monosynaptic projections to the spinal motoneurons. CMS-conditioning resulted in a subsequent 'late facilitation', which is considered to reflect activity of slow-conducting and/or indirect corticospinal pathways. In contrast, M1-conditioning produced a 'late dis-facilitation' or even 'late inhibition'. As the late dis-facilitation was only seen following M1- but not CMS-conditioning, it is argued that cortical activation during dynamic tasks is restricted to fast, direct corticospinal projections whereas corticomotoneurons responsible for slow and/or indirectly projecting corticospinal pathways are inhibited. The functional significance of restricting the descending cortical drive to fast corticospinal pathways may be to ensure a temporally focused motor command during the execution of dynamic movements.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Tongue corticospinal modulation during attended verbal stimuli: priming and coarticulation effects.", "issue": "13", "pmid": "16510720", "authors": ["D'Ausilio, A", "Jarmolowska, J", "Busan, P", "Bufalari, I", "Craighero, L"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Most neuroimaging studies on planning report bilateral activations of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).

Moreover, no interaction between task demands and stimulation type (real vs. sham) and/or stimulation side (left vs. right hemisphere) were found.

It has been suggested that priming these two types of self-construal affects the cognitive processing style that an individual adopts, especially with regard to context sensitivity. Specifically, an interdependent self-construal is thought to promote attention to others and social context to a greater degree than an independent self-construal.

Priming interdependent self-construal increased motor cortical output whereas priming independent self-construal did not, compared with a no-priming baseline condition.

Interestingly, the pattern of these self-construal-induced changes in the motor system corroborates with previously observed self-construal effects on overt behavioral mimicry in social settings, and as such, our results provide strong evidence that motor resonance likely mediates nonconscious mimicry in social settings.

The purpose of this study was to examine if this could be explained by removal of spinal inhibition of the descending command to soleus motoneurons. To test this, we investigated how afferent inputs from the tibialis anterior muscle modulate the corticospinal activation of soleus spinal motoneurons at rest, during static contraction and prior to movement. MEPs activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes), activated by electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve (PTN), were conditioned by prior stimulation of the common peroneal nerve (CPN) at a variety of conditioning-test (CT) intervals. MEPs in the precontracted soleus muscle were inhibited when the TMS pulse was preceded by CPN stimulation with a CT interval of 35 ms, and they were facilitated for CT intervals of 50-55 ms. A similar inhibition of the soleus H-reflex was not observed. To investigate which descending pathways might be responsible for the afferent-evoked inhibition and facilitation, we examined the effect of CPN stimulation on short-latency facilitation (SLF) and long-latency facilitation (LLF) of the soleus H-reflex induced by a subthreshold TMS pulse at different CT intervals. SLF is known to reflect the excitability of the fastest conducting, corticomotoneuronal cells whereas LLF is believed to be caused by more indirect descending pathways. At CT intervals of 40-45 ms, the LLF was significantly more inhibited compared to the SLF when taking the effect on the H-reflex into account. Finally, we investigated how the CPN-induced inhibition and facilitation of the soleus MEP were modulated prior to dorsiflexion. Whereas the late facilitation (CT interval: 55 ms) was similar prior to dorsiflexion and at rest, no inhibition could be evoked at the earlier latency (CT interval: 35 ms) prior to onset of dorsiflexion. The observation that the CPN-induced inhibition of soleus MEPs disappears prior to onset of dorsiflexion may explain why soleus MEPs are facilitated prior to onset of dorsiflexion contraction. A possible mechanism involves the removal of inhibition of the descending command to the motoneurons at a spinal interneuronal level because the inhibition was seen in LLF and not in SLF, and the MEP inhibition was not observed in the H-reflex. The data illustrate that spinal interneuronal pathways modify descending commands to human spinal motoneurons and influence the size of MEPs elicited by TMS.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic patients.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "21219259", "authors": ["Montagne-Larmurier, A", "Etard, O", "Ma\u00efza, O", "Dollfus, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Current opinion in psychiatry", "abstract": "We investigated whether essential tremor (ET) can be altered by suppressing the corticospinal excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "pages": "14"}, {"volume": "504", "title": "Magnetic stimulation intensity modulates motor inhibition.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12849236", "authors": ["Berger, U", "Korngreen, A", "Bar-Gad, I", "Friedman, A", "Wolfus, S", "Yeshurun, Y", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "10 Patients with ET and 10 healthy controls underwent transcranial continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left primary motor hand area at 80% (real cTBS) and 30% (control cTBS) of active motor threshold in two separate sessions at least one week apart.

As TMS interferes with neural activity, the hypothetical function of the stimulated area can thus be tested. One unresolved methodological issue in TMS experiments is the question of how to adequately calibrate stimulation intensities. The motor threshold (MT) is often taken as a reference for individually adapted stimulation intensities in TMS experiments, even if they do not involve the motor system. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether it is reasonable to adjust stimulation intensities in each subject to the individual MT if prefrontal regions are stimulated prior to the performance of a cognitive paradigm.", "pages": "14"}]
