In this combined rTMS/EEG study, we aimed to investigate changes in oscillatory activity after high-frequency (\u223c11 Hz) rTMS relative to the number of applied pulses. Twenty intermittent trains of 20 or 60 rTMS pulses were delivered over the human primary motor cortex at rest and tuned to individual mu frequency. The regional and interregional oscillatory neural activity after stimulation were evaluated using event-related power (ERPow) and event-related coherence (ERCoh) transformations. The most prominent changes for ERPow were observed in the theta band (4-7 Hz), as an increase in ERPow up to 20 s following 60 rTMS pulses, whereas ERPow increases were smaller in mu (10-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz). ERCoh revealed that rTMS 60 modulated the connectivity in the theta band for up to 20 s. The topography of mu and theta changes were not identical; mu was more focal and theta was more global. Our data suggested the presence of independent cortical theta and mu generators with different reactivity to rTMS but could not rule out possible thalamocortical contributions in generating theta and mu over the motor network.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "A review of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the in vivo functional evaluation of central cholinergic circuits in dementia.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21822020", "authors": ["Nardone, R", "Golaszewski, S", "Ladurner, G", "Tezzon, F", "Trinka, E"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders", "abstract": "Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling electrical peripheral stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. The short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) is reduced in cholinergic forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, while it is normal in non-cholinergic forms of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia. This finding suggests that this method can be used as a non-invasive additional tool for discriminating between cholinergic and non-cholinergic forms of dementia. Interestingly, SAI was also found to be significantly smaller in early AD patients. Identification of SAI abnormalities that occur early in the course of AD will allow earlier diagnosis and treatment with cholinergic drugs. In patients with vascular dementia, SAI responses varied widely; the number of patients with abnormal SAI conceivably reflects the percentage of subjects with a significant cholinergic dysfunction. It has recently been demonstrated that brain microbleeds have an impact on SAI that is independent of the extent of associated white matter changes and ischemic stroke. Since SAI can be increased by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, TMS may help in identifying the patients who would be suitable for long-term treatment with cholinergic agents.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Speech facilitation by left inferior frontal cortex stimulation.", "issue": "16", "pmid": "21820308", "authors": ["Holland, R", "Leff, AP", "Josephs, O", "Galea, JM", "Desikan, M", "Price, CJ", "Rothwell, JC", "Crinion, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Electrophysiological studies in humans and animals suggest that noninvasive neurostimulation methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can elicit long-lasting [1], polarity-dependent [2] changes in neocortical excitability.

To address this issue, we investigated the inhibitory effects of a continuous theta-burst TMS (cTBS) applied over left BA 44 in healthy subjects, just before they performed a serial RT task (SRTT). SRTT has been widely used to study motor skill learning and is also of interest because, for complex structured sequences, subjects spontaneously organize them into smaller subsequences, referred to as chunks. As a control, cTBS was applied over the vertex in another group, which underwent the same experiment. Control subjects showed both a general practice learning effect, evidenced by a progressive decrease in RT across blocks and a sequence-specific learning effect, demonstrated by a significant RT increase in a pseudorandom sequence. In contrast, when cTBS was applied over left BA 44, subjects lacked both the general practice and sequence-specific learning effects. However, surprisingly, their chunking pattern was preserved and remained indistinguishable from controls. The present study indicates that left BA 44 plays a role in motor sequence learning, but without being involved in elementary chunking.

For example, is scene perception simply an extension of object perception, or can global scene \"gist\" be processed independently of its component objects? Specifically, when recognizing a scene such as an \"office,\" does one need to first recognize its individual objects, such as the desk, chair, lamp, pens, and paper to build up the representation of an \"office\" scene? Here, we show that temporary interruption of object processing through repetitive TMS to the left lateral occipital cortex (LO), an area known to selectively process objects, impairs object categorization but surprisingly facilitates scene categorization. This result was replicated in a second experiment, which assessed the temporal dynamics of this disruption and facilitation. We further showed that repetitive TMS to left LO significantly disrupted object processing but facilitated scene processing when stimulation was administered during the first 180 msec of the task. This demonstrates that the visual system retains the ability to process scenes during disruption to object processing. Moreover, the facilitation of scene processing indicates disinhibition of areas involved in global scene processing, likely caused by disrupting inhibitory contributions from the LO.

Recently, utilization of transcranial magnetic stimulation has enhanced methodological rigour in this research because in addition to correlational studies causal effects of the distinct cortical systems involved can be studied. In these studies, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been implied as the brain area involved in deceptive behaviour. However, combined brain imaging and stimulation research has been concerned mostly with deceptive behaviour in the contexts of mock thefts and/or denial of recognition of critical objects. Spontaneous, \"criminally decontextuated\" propensity to lying and its dependence on the activity of selected brain structures has remained unexplored. The purpose of this work is to test whether spontaneous propensity to lying can be changed by brain stimulation. Here, we show that when subjects can name the colour of presented objects correctly or incorrectly at their free will, the tendency to stick to truthful answers can be manipulated by stimulation targeted at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Right hemisphere stimulation decreases lying, left hemisphere stimulation increases lying. Spontaneous choice to lie more or less can be influenced by brain stimulation.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation enhances BDNF-TrkB signaling in both brain and lymphocyte.", "issue": "30", "pmid": "21818722", "authors": ["Wang, HY", "Crupi, D", "Liu, J", "Stucky, A", "Cruciata, G", "Di Rocco, A", "Friedman, E", "Quartarone, A", "Ghilardi, MF"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive procedure whereby a pulsed magnetic field stimulates electrical activity in the brain.

Vestibular stimulation was induced with unilateral ear caloric irrigation (30\u00b0C) with subjects supine. Single transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses were delivered (double-cone coil, intensities 60-75% maximal output) every 10-20\u00a0s during vestibular activation and during baseline. Bilateral surface electromyography (EMG) from splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), obliquus externus abdominis, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior and peroneus longus was obtained. During whole-body maximal rotatory voluntary isometric contraction (MRVC), only SCM and BF displayed EMG activation/inhibition patterns indicating axial rotatory action. TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after caloric irrigation revealed that only SCM showed consistent vestibular-mediated excitation/inhibition responses, i.e. an increase in MEP area contralateral to the irrigation and a decrease in MEP area ipsilaterally (+12.7 and -6.3% of the MRVC, respectively). A putative head turn induced by this SCM activity pattern would be in the same direction of the slow-phase eye movement. EMG in the 100\u00a0ms preceding TMS showed muscle tone values of approximately 10% of MRVC. After caloric irrigation, these values increased by ca. 2% for all muscles bilaterally and hence cannot explain the direction-specific SCM MEP changes. Thus, SCM MEPs show caloric-induced amplitude modulation indicating that SCM is under both horizontal semicircular canal and corticospinal control. This vestibular modulation of corticospinal SCM control likely occurs at cortical levels. The direction of the MEP modulation indicates a directional coupling between vestibularly induced head and eye movements.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation modulates tinnitus intensity and tinnitus-distress-related brain activity.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "18083143", "authors": ["Vanneste, S", "De Ridder, D"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Recovery of motor function after stroke may depend on a balance of activity in the neural network involving the affected and the unaffected motor cortices.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "A randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study using a low frequency magnetic field in the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18466752", "authors": ["de Carvalho, ML", "Motta, R", "Konrad, G", "Battaglia, MA", "Brichetto, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)", "abstract": "To assess whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase the training-induced recovery of motor functions.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "The sound of size: crossmodal binding in pitch-size synesthesia: a combined TMS, EEG and psychophysics study.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18598264", "authors": ["Bien, N", "ten Oever, S", "Goebel, R", "Sack, AT"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "In an exploratory study, 14 patients with chronic stroke and mean Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Assessment of 29 (range = 8-50) entered a double-blind sham-controlled study, aimed to investigate neurophysiological and behavioral effects of bihemispheric tDCS (cathodal stimulation of the unaffected motor cortex and anodal stimulation of the affected motor cortex), combined with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "213", "title": "The effect of baclofen and diazepam on motor skill acquisition in healthy subjects.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "18678897", "authors": ["Willerslev-Olsen, M", "Lundbye-Jensen, J", "Petersen, TH", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of the left PMC in sensorimotor timing and error correction using theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS). In Experiment 1, subjects performed a sensorimotor synchronization task (SMS) with the left and the right hand before and after either continuous or intermittent TBS (cTBS or iTBS). Timing accuracy was assessed during synchronized finger tapping with a regular auditory pacing stimulus. Responses following perceivable local timing shifts in the pacing stimulus (phase shifts) were used to measure error correction. Suppression of the left PMC using cTBS decreased timing accuracy because subjects tapped further away from the pacing tones and tapping variability increased. In addition, error correction responses returned to baseline tap-tone asynchrony levels faster following negative shifts and no overcorrection occurred following positive shifts after cTBS. However, facilitation of the left PMC using iTBS did not affect timing accuracy or error correction performance. Experiment 2 revealed that error correction performance may change with practice, independent of TBS. These findings provide evidence for a role of the left PMC in both sensorimotor timing and error correction in both hands.

The conditioning cerebellar stimulus was given over the cerebellum and the test stimulus over the primary motor cortex. We studied how the conditioning stimulus modulated motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to the cortical test stimulus. In non-ataxic limbs, the cerebellar stimulus normally suppressed cortical MEPs. In ataxic limbs, the cerebellar inhibition was not elicited in patients with a lesion at the posterior limb of internal capsule (case 1) or thalamus (case 2). In contrast, normal cerebellar inhibition was elicited in the ataxic limb in a patient with a lesion at sensori-motor cortex (case 3). Lesions at the internal capsule and thalamus involved the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways and reduced the cerebellar suppression effect. On the other hand, a lesion at the pre- and post-central gyri should affect cortico-pontine pathway but not involve the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways.

Our aim was to investigate if such a mechanism plays a role in the case of pitch-size stimulus combinations. Using a combination of psychophysics and ERPs, we could show that despite violations of spatial correspondence, the brain specifically integrates certain stimulus combinations which are congruent with respect to our hypothesis of pitch-size synesthesia, thereby impairing performance on an auditory spatial localisation task (Ventriloquist effect). Subsequently, we perturbed this process by functionally disrupting a brain area known for its role in multisensory processes, the right intraparietal sulcus, and observed how the Ventriloquist effect was abolished, thereby increasing behavioural performance. Correlating behavioural, TMS and ERP results, we could retrace the origin of the synesthestic pitch-size mappings to a right intraparietal involvement around 250 ms. The results of this combined psychophysics, TMS and ERP study provide evidence for shifting the current viewpoint on synesthesia more towards synesthesia being at the extremity of a spectrum of normal, adaptive perceptual processes, entailing close interplay between the different sensory systems.

The study was designed as a semi-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 16 healthy human subjects. The motor skill task required the subjects to match a given force trajectory by increasing or decreasing ankle dorsiflexor torque. Subjects trained for a total of 30\u00a0min. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex leg area was applied to elicit motor evoked potentials in the anterior tibial muscle (TA). Coupling between populations of TA motor units was calculated in the frequency (coherence) domain during isometric dorsiflexion. Subjects receiving placebo showed statistically significant improvement in motor performance (q\u00a0=\u00a034.1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014) accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in intramuscular coherence. Subjects receiving baclofen and diazepam conversely showed no progression in motor performance (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), and the training was not accompanied by a decrease in intramuscular coherence. TA motor evoked potentials had significantly lower threshold following the training in the placebo group, whereas this was not the case in the treatment groups. These data indicate that diazepam and baclofen interfere with the acquisition of a motor skill by disrupting some of the neuroplastic changes that are involved in improved motor performance. This suggests that antispastic treatment should be used with caution in subjects receiving concomitant physiotherapy.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Mirroring avatars: dissociation of action and intention in human motor resonance.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17180162", "authors": ["Borroni, P", "Gorini, A", "Riva, G", "Bouchard, S", "Cerri, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "We investigated whether chronic headache related to medication overuse (MOH) is associated with changes in brain mechanisms regulating inhibitory cortical responses compared with healthy volunteers and episodic migraineurs recorded between attacks, and whether these changes differ according to the drug overused.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "213", "title": "Intense training overcomes effects of the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism on short-term plasticity.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17170134", "authors": ["McHughen, SA", "Pearson-Fuhrhop, K", "Ngo, VK", "Cramer, SC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Peripheral fatigue was measured using brachial plexus (elbow flexors) or sacral plexus (AS) stimulation during contraction and at rest.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "What does Neural Plasticity Tell us about Role of Primary Visual Cortex (V1) in Visual Awareness?", "issue": "", "pmid": "7702443", "authors": ["Silvanto, J", "Rees, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "abstract": "Ability to maximally activate AS (75.9%) was less than for the elbow flexors at baseline (91.6%).

There are two primary methods of noninvasive brain stimulation currently available: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Both noninvasive neuromodulation techniques appear to rely on modulating brain plasticity and thus open new hopes in the treatment of brain circuit and plasticity disorders. Since many childhood psychiatric disorders involve disturbances in the timing or mechanisms of plasticity within frontostriatal circuits, and the developing brain shows a greater capacity of brain plasticity, noninvasive brain stimulation might induce greater benefits in this population than in adults. Although the utilization of TMS and tDCS remains limited in children, there is enough evidence for their rational, safe use in this population. In this paper, we review the principles of noninvasive brain stimulation and the diagnostic and therapeutic applications in child-hood psychiatric disorders in order to inform its development into safe and reliable diagnostic and effective therapeutic approaches in pediatric psychiatry.", "pages": "2224-37"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Functional mapping of rat brain activation following rTMS using activity-induced manganese-dependent contrast.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "8815919", "authors": ["Fa, Z", "Zhang, P", "Wu, W", "Wang, Z", "Huang, F", "Yang, L", "Chang, H", "Xu, R", "Wen, Z", "Zhang, J", "Zeng, Y", "Jiang, X"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "The hemodynamic response to low-intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has previously been demonstrated at motor cortex using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
