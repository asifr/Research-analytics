Eleven normal subjects and 12 patients with dystonia involving the upper limbs (7 with generalized dystonia, 2 with segmental dystonia, and 3 with focal dystonia) were studied. Patients were assessed clinically with the Dystonia Movement Scale. Paired magnetic stimuli were delivered by two Magstim 200 magnetic stimulators connected through a Bistim module to a figure-of-eight coil placed over the motor area of the forearm muscles. Paired stimulation was given at rest. A subthreshold (80% of motor threshold) conditioning stimulus was delivered 3 and 5 msec before the suprathreshold (120% of motor threshold) test stimulus. Electromyographic signals were recorded over the flexor or extensor muscles of the forearm on the affected side. We measured the amplitude of the test motor evoked potential (expressed as a percentage of the unconditioned motor evoked potential). All results were compared using ANOVA. In all patients, a botulinum toxin type A injection (50-100 mouse units) reduced dystonic movements in the arm. In normal subjects, electromyographic recordings showed significant inhibition of the test response. Before botulinum toxin injection, patients had less test response inhibition than normal subjects. One month after injection, patients had test response inhibition similar to that of normal subjects. At 3 months after injection, they again had less inhibition than normal subjects or patients at 1 month after injection. In conclusion, our data suggest that botulinum toxin can transiently alter the excitability of the cortical motor areas by reorganizing the inhibitory and excitatory intracortical circuits. The cortical changes probably originate through peripheral mechanisms.", "pages": "58-61"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in acute facial nerve injury.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "10894209", "authors": ["Har-El, G", "McPhee, JR"], "year": "2000", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "abstract": "Available electrodiagnostic tests that are used to evaluate facial nerve injury examine the nerve distal to the stylomastoid foramen; because most facial nerve injuries are within the temporal bone, the tests cannot evaluate the nerve at or across the injury site.

To assess the excitability of the cortical inhibitory mechanisms responsible for the silent period after transcranial stimulation, we studied, in 15 healthy human subjects, the recovery cycle of the silent period evoked by transcranial and mixed nerve stimulation delivered with a paired stimulation technique. The recovery cycle is defined as the time course of the changes in the size or duration of a conditioned test response when pairs of stimuli (conditioning and test) are used at different conditioning-test intervals. The recovery cycle of the duration of the silent period in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle during maximum voluntary contraction after transcranial magnetic stimulation was studied by delivering paired magnetic shocks (a conditioning shock and a test shock) at 120% motor-threshold intensity. Conditioning-test intervals ranged from 20-550 ms. The recovery cycle of the silent period in the FDI muscle during maximum voluntary contraction after nerve stimulation was evaluated by paired, supramaximum bipolar electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist (conditioning-test intervals ranging from 20 to 550 ms). Electromyographic activity was recorded by a pair of surface-disk electrodes over the FDI muscle. The recovery cycle of the silent period after transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered through the large round coil showed two phases of facilitation (lengthening of the silent period), one at 20-40 ms and the other at 180-350 ms conditioning-test intervals, with an interposed phase of inhibition (shortening of the silent period) at 80-160 ms. The conditioning magnetic shock left the size of the test motor-evoked potentials statistically unchanged during maximum voluntary contraction. Paired transcranial stimulation with a figure-of-eight coil increased the duration of the test silent period only at short conditioning-test intervals.

Transcortical reflex pathways according to this view are reserved for the control of the distal upper limb and are seen in close relation to the evolution of the primate hand.

Noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human occipital cortex can evoke the perception of flashes or spots of light (phosphenes). To assess changes in visual cortex excitability following light deprivation, we measured the minimum intensity of stimulation required to elicit phosphenes (phosphene threshold) and the number of phosphenes elicited by different TMS stimulus intensities (stimulus-response curves). A reduced phosphene threshold was detected 45 min after the onset of light deprivation and persisted for the entire deprivation period (180 min). Following re-exposure to light, phosphene thresholds returned to predeprivation values over 120 min. Stimulus-response curves were significantly enhanced in association with this intervention. In a second experiment, we studied the effects of light deprivation on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals elicited by photic stimulation. fMRI results showed increased visual cortex activation after 60 min of light deprivation that persisted following 30 min of re-exposure to light.

Nine right-handed subjects performed right and left thumb extensions in simple (SRT), choice (CRT) and go/no-go auditory RT paradigms. TMS, inducing motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) simultaneously in the extensor pollicis brevis muscles bilaterally, was applied at different latencies from the tone. For all paradigms, MEP amplitudes on the side of movement increased progressively in the 80-120 ms before EMG onset, while the resting side showed inhibition. The inhibition was significantly more pronounced for right than for left thumb movements. For the left SRT, significant facilitation occurred on the right after EMG onset. Initial bilateral facilitation occurred in SRT trials with slow RT. After no-go tones, bilateral inhibition occurred at a time corresponding to the mean RT to go tones. The timing of the corticospinal rise in excitability on the side of movement was independent of task difficulty and RT. This suggests that corticospinal activation is, to some extent, in series and not in parallel with stimulus processing and response selection. Corticospinal inhibition on the side not to be moved implies that suppression of movement is an active process.
