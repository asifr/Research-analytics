The neural substrates of this rhythmic motor entrainment are still under investigation. Correlational neuroimaging data suggest an involvement of the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). In 14 healthy volunteers, we more specifically investigated the neural network underlying this phenomenon using a causal approach by an established 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol, which produces a focal suppression of cortical excitability outlasting the stimulation period. Synchronization accuracy between rhythmic cues and right index finger tapping, as measured by the mean time lag (asynchrony) between motor and auditory events, was significantly affected when the right dPMC function was transiently perturbed by \"off-line\" focal rTMS, whereas the reproduction of the rhythmic sequence per se (inter-tap-interval) was spared. This approach affected metrical rhythms of different complexity, but not non-metrical or isochronous sequences. Conversely, no change in auditory-motor synchronization was observed with rTMS of the SMA, of the left dPMC or over a control site (midline occipital area). Our data strongly support the view that the right dPMC is crucial for rhythmic auditory-motor synchronization in humans.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Can cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation become a valuable neurorehabilitation intervention?", "issue": "11", "pmid": "23234389", "authors": ["Block, HJ", "Celnik, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Expert review of neurotherapeutics", "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been widely used, with some modification of its methods, for the treatment of refractory mental disorders.

There is growing evidence that a neural network of both auditory and non-auditory cortical areas is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic subjective tinnitus. Targeting several core regions of this network by rTMS might constitute a promising strategy to enhance treatment effects. This study intends to test the effects of a multisite rTMS protocol on tinnitus severity. 45 patients with chronic tinnitus were treated with multisite stimulation (left dorsolateral prefrontal, 2,000 stimuli, 20\u00a0Hz; left temporoparietal, 1,000 stimuli, 1\u00a0Hz; right temporoparietal, 1,000 stimuli, 1\u00a0Hz). Results were compared with a historical control group consisting of 29 patients who received left temporal stimulation (2,000 stimuli, 1\u00a0Hz). Both groups were treated on ten consecutive working days. Tinnitus severity was assessed at three time points: at baseline, after the last treatment session (day 12) and after a follow-up period of 90\u00a0days. A change of tinnitus severity over time was tested using repeated measures ANOVA with the between-subjects factor treatment group. Both groups improved similarly from baseline to day 12. However, there was a difference on day 90: the multisite stimulation group showed an overall improvement whereas patients receiving temporal stimulation returned to their baseline level of tinnitus severity.

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying these opposite changes in corticomotor excitability remains elusive. Modulation of primary sensory cortex (S1) excitability could underlie altered corticomotor excitability with PES. Here we examined whether changes in primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex excitability follow the same time-course when PES is applied using identical stimulus parameters. Corticomotor excitability was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and sensory cortex excitability using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) before and after 30 min of PES to right abductor pollicis brevis (APB). Two PES paradigms were tested in separate sessions; PES sufficient to induce a tetanic motor contraction (30-50 Hz; strong motor intensity) and PES at sub motor-threshold intensity (100 Hz). PES applied to induce strong activation of APB increased the size of the N(20)-P(25) component, thought to reflect sensory processing at cortical level, and increased corticomotor excitability. PES at sensory intensity decreased the size of the P25-N33 component and reduced corticomotor excitability. A positive correlation was observed between the changes in amplitude of the cortical SEP components and corticomotor excitability following sensory and motor PES. Sensory PES also increased the sub-cortical P(14)-N(20) SEP component. These findings provide evidence that PES results in co-modulation of S1 and M1 excitability, possibly due to cortico-cortical projections between S1 and M1.

Movement speed and accuracy of the right hand were assessed in 15 right-handed subjects before and after (0, 30 and 60 min) tACS of M1. Cortical silent period (CSP) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were determined as measures of M1 excitability. While 10 Hz tACS particularly increased movement variability, especially in tasks requiring internal pacing, 20 Hz tACS resulted in movement slowing. Behavioural effects occurred in distinct time windows. While 10 Hz effects developed over 30 min after stimulation, 20 Hz tACS effects were found immediately after stimulation. Following 10 Hz tACS these effects were significantly correlated with CSP duration, indicating interference with inhibitory pathways.

Postural stability (\u03c3r) was quantified from plane phase plots based on center or pressure, and psychological indices of depression, fatigue and kinesiophobia were obtained. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess corticospinal excitability by quantifying the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude of the flexor carpi radialis, and intracortical excitability was assessed by quantifying indices of intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval and long-interval intracortical inhibition using a paired-pulse TMS paradigm.

Complexity arises because reach-to-grasp actions not only require directing the hand towards the object (transport component), but also preshaping the hand according to the features of the object (grip component). Yet, the functional influence that specific PPC regions exert over ipsilateral M1 during the planning of different hand movements remains unclear in humans. Here we manipulated transport and grip components of goal-directed hand movements and exploited paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ((pp)TMS) to probe the functional interactions between M1 and two different PPC regions, namely superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) and the anterior region of the intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), in the left hemisphere. We show that when the extension of the arm is required to contact a target object, SPOC selectively facilitates motor evoked potentials, suggesting that SPOC-M1 interactions are functionally specific to arm transport. In contrast, a different pathway, linking the aIPS and ipsilateral M1, shows enhanced functional connections during the sensorimotor planning of grip. These results support recent human neuroimaging findings arguing for specialized human parietal regions for the planning of arm transport and hand grip during goal-directed actions.

Spinal and supra-spinal mechanisms can be involved. A fundamental contribution to the comprehension of these mechanisms is provided by non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. They have revealed a general reduction of motor cortical excitability and central drive during fatiguing exercise, also confirmed by direct recording of corticospinal activity.

However, clinical trials to date have reported conflicting evidence concerning its overall efficacy, which might have resulted from low statistical power. Thus, meta-analytical approaches could be useful in examining this issue by allowing the integration of findings from multiple studies and thus producing more accurate estimates of the treatment effect. Method We searched the literature for randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on bilateral rTMS for treating MD from 1995 to July 2012 using EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and from October 2008 until May 2012 using Medline. The main outcome measures were response and remission rates. We used a random-effects model, odds ratios (ORs) and the number needed to treat. RESULTS: Data were obtained from seven RCTs, totaling 279 subjects with MD. After an average of 12.9 (s.d.\u00a0=\u00a02.7) sessions, 24.7% (40/162) and 6.8% (8/117) of subjects receiving active bilateral rTMS and sham rTMS were classified as responders [OR 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95-9.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001].

No difference between baseline mean depression scores for the bilateral and sham rTMS groups was found, and the former was comparable with the latter in terms of drop-out rates at study end. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences efficacy- and acceptability-wise between active bilateral and unilateral rTMS at study end. Finally, heterogeneity between the included RCTs was not significant, and the risk of publication bias was found to be low.

To learn more about the effects of repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS), we established an in vitro model of rMS using mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures. We assessed the outcome of a high-frequency (10 Hz) rMS protocol on functional and structural properties of excitatory synapses in mature hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry, and time-lapse imaging techniques revealed that rMS induces a long-lasting increase in glutamatergic synaptic strength, which is accompanied by structural remodeling of dendritic spines. The effects of rMS on spine size were predominantly seen in small spines, suggesting differential effects of rMS on subpopulations of spines. Furthermore, our data indicate that rMS-induced postsynaptic changes depend on the NMDA receptor-mediated accumulation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors. These results provide first experimental evidence that rMS induces coordinated functional and structural plasticity of excitatory postsynapses, which is consistent with a long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "26", "title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation and motor cortex stimulation in neuropathic pain].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "23220839", "authors": ["Mylius, V", "Ayache, SS", "Teepker, M", "Kappus, C", "Kolodziej, M", "Rosenow, F", "Nimsky, C", "Oertel, WH", "Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Schmerz (Berlin, Germany)", "abstract": "We used adaptation to high and low gains in a virtual reality setup of the hand to test competing hypotheses about the excitability changes that accompany motor learning. Excitability was assayed through changes in amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in relevant hand muscles elicited with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). One hypothesis is that MEPs will either increase or decrease, directly reflecting the effect of low or high gain on motor output. The alternative hypothesis is that MEP changes are not sign dependent but rather serve as a marker of visuomotor learning, independent of performance or visual-to-motor mismatch (i.e., error). Subjects were required to make flexion movements of a virtual forefinger to visual targets. A gain of 1 meant that the excursions of their real finger and virtual finger matched. A gain of 0.25 (\"low gain\") indicated a 75% reduction in visual versus real finger displacement, a gain of 1.75 (\"high gain\") the opposite. MEP increases (>40%) were noted in the tonically activated task-relevant agonist muscle for both high- and low-gain perturbations after adaptation reached asymptote with kinematics matched to veridical levels. Conversely, only small changes in excitability occurred in a control task of pseudorandom gains that required adjustments to large errors but in which learning could not accumulate.

Of these, only two (transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation) currently have US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of depression.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Comparing Cortical Plasticity Induced by Conventional and High-Definition 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 Ring tDCS: A Neurophysiological Study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "15033139", "authors": ["Kuo, HI", "Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Minhas, P", "Paulus, W", "Kuo, MF", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a sensorimotor disorder where the sensitivity to external and internal stimuli might be increased and unwanted responses to such stimuli cannot be sufficiently suppressed.Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies indicate that, at rest, axonal excitability of cortico-spinal neurons and intra-cortical inter-neurons was consistently normal in GTS. However, synaptic excitability in cortico-spinal neurons and the SICI circuit may be lower than normal. In addition, an electrophysiological marker of sensory motor integration, SAI, was reduced in the baseline state consistent with reduced efficiency of synaptic inhibition. Given the possible influence of sensory inputs in triggering the release of tics reduced SAI may be a direct physiological reflection of increased access of sensory input to motor output in GTS. Experiments examining control of voluntary movements revealed that in GTS motor cortex excitability increases less than in controls when preparing a movement even though intra-cortical inhibition (i.e. SICI) normalises. In GTS the gain of many motor circuits may be reduced and hence less sensitive to small changes in input from other areas. These cortical changes may constitute an adaptive response to abnormal basal ganglia-motor cortex inputs.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "212", "title": "Structural and functional cortical disconnection in Alzheimer's disease: a combined study using diffusion tensor imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16796215", "authors": ["Wegrzyn, M", "Teipel, SJ", "Oltmann, I", "Bauer, A", "Thome, J", "Gro\u00dfmann, A", "Hauenstein, K", "H\u00f6ppner, J"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) allows non-invasive stimulation of the human brain.

The patients received daily sessions of rTMS over the left prefrontal cortex as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy. The rTMS intensity was set at 100% of the motor threshold and 25 Hz stimulation, with train duration of 2 seconds delivered at 30-second intervals. A full course comprised 1000 magnetic pulses. Depression was rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) before and after treatment. Response was defined as a 50% reduction in the HAMD score. Patients with HAMD scores of less than 8 were considered to be in remission. The mean HAMD score for the study group decreased from 22.59 \u00b1 5.92 to 10.50 \u00b1 5.83 (P < .001). After the treatment period, 268 (64%) out of 419 patients demonstrated significant mood improvements, as indexed by a reduction of more than 50% on the HAMD score. In addition, 140 patients (33.4%) attained remission (HAMD score <8); and 11 patients achieved a partial response. Treatment was generally well tolerated, and no serious adverse effects were reported. In conclusion, high-frequency (25\u00a0Hz) rTMS was well tolerated and found to be statistically and clinically effective in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

Interestingly, subanesthetic doses of racemic ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, had no effects on intracortical excitability evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this study, we aimed to substantiate these findings by using the more active enantiomer (S)-ketamine. (S)-ketamine has a threefold higher affinity for the NMDA receptor, but relatively little is known about its specific effects on human motor cortex excitability. Eleven healthy subjects (two female) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study with four treatment conditions: either placebo or one of three subanesthetic doses of intravenous (S)-ketamine (serum target 10, 30 and 50 ng/ml, respectively). We assessed intracortical inhibition and facilitation using a paired-pulse TMS-paradigm. Resting motor threshold and cortical silent period were assessed as additional parameters. Solely at highest (S)-ketamine concentrations, intracortical inhibition was significantly reduced and intracortical facilitation strongly tended to be enhanced. In addition, we found a tendency to a prolonged silent period, while resting motor threshold was unaffected. We conclude that subanesthetic doses of (S)-ketamine show an enhancement on excitability in human motor cortex. Similar to findings using the racemic mixture of ketamine, the effect may be due to an increase in non-NMDA glutamatergic transmission which outweighs the NMDA receptor blockade.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "47", "title": "[Research progress of transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for tinnitus].", "issue": "9", "pmid": "23213288", "authors": ["Peng, Z", "Gong, SS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery", "abstract": "Neuromuscular deficits are common in people with chronic ankle instability (CAI).
