The purposes of the current study were (1) to determine whether corticospinal tract (CST) excitability is altered by resisted walking and (2) to ascertain whether changes in cortical excitability are muscle specific. Forty healthy participants walked with a robotic gait device (Lokomat) that applied a velocity-dependent resistance against hip and knee movements during walking. CST excitability was assessed by quantifying motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately before and after baseline and resisted walking. MEPs were measured in either the biceps femoris (BF) or the rectus femoris (RF). Recruitment curves were collected by stimulating in 5 % increments from 105 to 145 % of active motor threshold. Results demonstrated a significant increase in MEP amplitude in the BF following baseline walking in the Lokomat. The RF did not demonstrate these changes. There was no further change in MEP size following resisted walking in either muscle group. These results suggest that locomotion increases CST excitability in a muscle-specific fashion.

We recruited 25 healthy adults to take part in three experimental sessions. Cortical excitability was examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the right first dorsal interosseus muscle. Levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cortisol were assessed throughout the experiments. Following baseline testing, participants cycled on a stationary bike at a workload equivalent to 57% (low intensity, 30 min) or 77% age-predicted maximal heart rate (moderate intensity, 15 min), or a seated control condition. Neuroplasticity within the primary motor cortex was then examined using a continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) paradigm. We found that exercise did not alter cortical excitability. Following cTBS, there was a transient inhibition of first dorsal interosseus motor-evoked potentials during control and low-intensity conditions, but this was only significantly different following the low-intensity state. Moderate-intensity exercise alone increased serum cortisol levels, but brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels did not increase across any condition. In summary, low-intensity cycling promoted the neuroplastic response to cTBS within the motor cortex of healthy adults.

It was hypothesised that by engaging similar 'planning' processes, the dual-task condition may facilitate the activation of shared 'planning' circuitry that includes dorsal premotor cortex (dPM), an important neural substrate for CRT task performance and movement preparation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects underwent a randomized crossover experiment to induce virtual aphasia by targeting the Brodmann area 44 and 45 for nTMS, and F3 of international 10-20 system for cTMS. Reaction time for a picture naming task and the reaction duration for a six-digit number naming task were measured before and after each session of stimulation, and compared between the cTMS and nTMS. The stability of the coil positioning on the target was measured by depicting the variability of talairach coordinates (x, y, z) of the sampled stimulation localizations. RESULTS: At baseline, outcome variables were comparable between cTMS and nTMS. nTMS induced significant delays in reaction time from 944.0 \u00b1 203.4 msec to 1304.6 \u00b1 215.7\u2009msec (p < 0.001) and reaction duration from 1780.5 \u00b1 286.8\u2009msec to 1914.9 \u00b1 295.6\u2009msec (p < 0.001) compared with baseline, whereas cTMS showed no significant changes (p = 0.959 and p = 0.179, respectively). The mean talairach space coordinates of nTMS demonstrated greater consistency of localization of stimulation with the target, and the error range relative to the target was narrower for the nTMS compared with the cTMS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: nTMS leads to more robust neuromodulation of Broca's area, resulting in delayed verbal reaction time as well as more accurate targeting of the intended stimulation location, demonstrating superiority of nTMS over cTMS for therapeutic use of rTMS in neurorehabilitation.", "pages": "187-791"}, {"volume": "136", "title": "Capturing the epileptic trait: cortical excitability measures in patients and their unaffected siblings.", "issue": "Pt 4", "pmid": "23485850", "authors": ["Badawy, RA", "Vogrin, SJ", "Lai, A", "Cook, MJ"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "The authors' aim was to determine the cortical mechanisms that underlie the transition from effective performance to its disruption.

Forty-four subjects performed either 5 or 10 min of repetitive finger movements paced by tones at 2 Hz, a frequency below the spontaneous movement rate. Changes of corticospinal excitability were assessed with TMS at rest and during motor response preparation (premovement facilitation paradigm). Over time, variability of movement rate increased, while the average movement rate shifted toward self-paced rhythms, without significant changes in other kinematic parameters. Amplitudes of motor evoked potentials at rest decreased depending on task duration and TMS intensity. Moreover, 5-min exercise induced fully compensatory increases in premovement facilitation, while 10-min exercise produced partially compensatory increases with loss of temporal modulation. Our findings suggest that protracted exercise induces significant decrements in corticospinal excitability with initial impairment of the phasic motor neurons that are recruited at higher stimulus intensities.

In the particular domain of visual perception, specific frequency bands in different brain regions and networks, from sensory areas to large-scale frontoparietal systems, have been associated with distinct aspects of visual behavior. Nonetheless, their contributions to human visual cognition remain to be causally demonstrated. We hereby used non-uniform (and thus non-frequency-specific) and uniform (frequency-specific) high-beta and gamma patterns of noninvasive neurostimulation over the right frontal eye field (FEF) to isolate the behavioral effects of oscillation frequency and provide causal evidence that distinct visual behavioral outcomes could be modulated by frequency-specific activity emerging from a single cortical region. In a visual detection task using near-threshold targets, high-beta frequency enhanced perceptual sensitivity (d') without changing response criterion (beta), whereas gamma frequency shifted response criterion but showed no effects on perceptual sensitivity. The lack of behavioral modulations by non-frequency-specific patterns demonstrates that these behavioral effects were specifically driven by burst frequency. We hypothesize that such frequency-coded behavioral impact of oscillatory activity may reflect a general brain mechanism to multiplex functions within the same neural substrate.

It has been suggested that the source of interference is competition of neural resources, although the neuronal mechanisms are unknown. Learning induces long-term potentiation (LTP), which can ultimately limit the ability to induce further LTP, a phenomenon known as occlusion. In humans we quantified the magnitude of occlusion of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation-induced increased excitability after learning a skill task as an index of the amount of LTP-like plasticity used. We found that retention of a newly acquired skill, as reflected by performance in the second day of practice, is proportional to the magnitude of occlusion. Moreover, the degree of behavioral interference was correlated with the magnitude of occlusion. Individuals with larger occlusion after learning the first skill were (1) more resilient to retrograde interference and (2) experienced larger anterograde interference when training a second task, as expressed by decreased performance of the learned skill in the second day of practice. This effect was not observed if sufficient time elapsed between training the two skills and LTP-like occlusion was not present.

Magnetic stimulation over the spinal enlargements can activate spinal nerves at the neuroforamina (magnetic-neuroforamina stimulation). This stimulation method provides us with information related to the latency of compound-muscle action potential (CMAP), which is usually interpreted as peripheral motor-conduction time (PMCT). However, this stimulation method has faced several problems in clinical applications. One is that supramaximal CMAPs were unobtainable. Another is that magnetic stimulation did not usually activate the spinal nerves in the spinal canal, i.e., the cauda equina, which prevented an evaluation of its conduction. For these reasons, magnetic-neuroforamina stimulation was rarely used to evaluate the conduction of peripheral nerves. It was mainly used to evaluate the conduction of the corticospinal tract using the parameter of central motor-conduction time (CMCT), which was calculated by subtracting PMCT from the latency of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex. Recently, supramaximal stimulation has been achieved in magnetic-neuroforamina stimulation, and this has contributed to the measurement of both CMAP size and latency. The achievement of supramaximal stimulation is ascribed to the increase in magnetic-stimulator output and a novel coil, the magnetic augmented translumbosacral stimulation (MATS) coil. The most proximal part of the cauda equina can be reliably activated using the MATS coil (magnetic-conus stimulation), thus contributing to the measurement of cauda equina conduction time (CECT) and cortico-conus motor-conduction time (CCCT). These recent developments in magnetic-motor-root stimulation enable us to more precisely evaluate the conduction of the proximal part of peripheral nerves and that of the corticospinal tract for lower-limb muscles.

Neurophysiological tests were conducted before and after robotic gait training in one person with a motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) while at rest and during robotic-assisted stepping. The TA flexion reflex was evoked following nonnociceptive sural nerve stimulation and was conditioned by TMS at 0.9 TA motor evoked potential resting threshold at conditioning-test intervals that ranged from 70 to 130 ms. Subthreshold TMS induced a significant facilitation on the TA flexion reflex before training, which was reversed to depression after training with the subject seated at rest. During stepping, corticospinal facilitation of the flexion reflex at early and midstance phases before training was replaced with depression at early and midswing followed by facilitation at late swing after training.

Consequently, it is of interest to find out which factors cause modulation of SICI. Purpose: To establish if visual feedback and force requirements influence SICI. Methods: SICI was assessed from 10 healthy adults (5 males and 5 females aged between 21 and 35 years) in three submaximal isometric elbow flexion torque levels [5, 20, and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] and with two tasks differing in terms of visual feedback. Single-pulse and paired-pulse motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), supramaximal M-wave, and background surface electromyogram (sEMG) were recorded from the biceps brachii muscle. Results: Repeated measures MANOVA was used for statistical analyses. Background sEMG did not differ between tasks (F = 0.4, P = 0.68) nor was task \u00d7 torque level interaction observed (F = 1.2, P = 0.32), whereas background sEMG increased with increasing torque levels (P = 0.001). SICI did not differ between tasks (F = 0.9, P = 0.43) and no task \u00d7 torque level interaction was observed (F = 2.3, P = 0.08).

Here, we demonstrate by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that the transient disruption of the right, but not the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), reduces parochial punishment in a third-party punishment paradigm with real social groups. Moreover, we show that this observed TMS effect on parochial punishment is mediated by a classical punishment motive, i.e. retaliation.

Bolus modification with adaptation of texture and viscosity of solids and fluids and postural adjustments should be part of the minimal treatment protocol, but they do not change the impaired swallow physiology nor promote recovery of damaged neural swallow networks in stroke patients.

The expectation is that these methods may promote recovery of function following brain injury. To assess their effects on motor output, it is typical to assess the state of corticospinal projections from primary motor cortex to muscles of the hand, via electromyographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation. If a range of stimulation intensities is employed, the recruitment curves (RCs) obtained can, at least for intrinsic hand muscles, be fitted by a sigmoid function. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To establish whether sigmoid fits provide a reliable basis upon which to characterize the input-output properties of the corticospinal pathway for muscles proximal to the hand, and to assess as an alternative the area under the (recruitment) curve (AURC). METHODS: A comparison of the reliability of these measures, using RCs obtained for muscles that are frequently the targets of rehabilitation. RESULTS: The AURC is an extremely reliable measure of the state of corticospinal projections to hand and forearm muscles, which has both face and concurrent validity. Construct validity is demonstrated by detection of widely distributed (across muscles) changes in corticospinal excitability induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS). CONCLUSION(S): The parameters derived from sigmoid fits are unlikely to provide an adequate means to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic regimes. The AURC can be employed to characterize corticospinal projections to a range of muscles, and gauge the efficacy of longitudinal interventions in clinical rehabilitation.", "pages": "187-791"}, {"volume": "133", "title": "Combined rTMS to the auditory cortex and prefrontal cortex for tinnitus control in patients with depression: a pilot study.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "20164404", "authors": ["Park, S", "Park, HJ", "Kyeong, SH", "Moon, IS", "Kim, M", "Kim, HN", "Choi, JY"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Acta oto-laryngologica", "abstract": "Involvement of pyramidal cells and/or changes in excitability of brain areas remote from an ischemic stroke has been demonstrated.

Here, we report the results of a systematic targeting procedure with small \"high-definition\" electrodes that was used in preparation for a pilot study on 8 stroke patients with chronic aphasia. We employ functional and anatomical magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI/MRI) to define a target and optimize (with respect to the electric field magnitude at the target) the electrode configuration, respectively, and demonstrate that electric field strengths in targeted cortex can be substantially increased (63%) over the conventional approach. The optimal montage exhibits significant variation across subjects as well as when perturbing the target location within a subject. However, for each displacement of the target co-ordinates, the algorithm is able to determine a montage which delivers a consistent amount of current to that location.

Here we used theta burst stimulation (TBS) to examine whether the BDNF val(66)met genotype can be used to predict the expression of TBS-induced homeostatic metaplasticity in human M1HAND.

We assessed this possibility by targeting the high-level cognitive abilities of learning and automaticity in the mathematical domain. Notably, learning and automaticity represent critical abilities for potential cognitive enhancement in typical and atypical populations. Over 6 d, healthy human adults underwent cognitive training on a new numerical notation while receiving TES to the posterior parietal cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation to the the posterior parietal cortex facilitated numerical learning, whereas automaticity for the learned material was impaired.

Thirty-three psychotic patients indicated the presence of AVH during two subsequent scans. Reproducibility was measured by calculating 1) the distance between local maxima of significantly activated clusters and 2) percentage overlap of activation patterns over the two scans. These measurements were obtained both in single subjects and on group-level in five regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs consisted of the areas that were most frequently activated during AVH. Scans were considered reproducible if the distance between local maxima was smaller than 2 cm, as rTMS-treatment may target an area of approximately 2-4 cm. The median distance between local maxima was smaller than 2 cm for all ROIs on single-subject level, as well as on group-level. In addition, on single-subject level median percentage overlap varied between 14 and 38% for the different ROIs. On group-level, this was substantially higher with percentages overlap varying between 34 and 98%.

The amplitudes of the ipsilateral and contralateral TEPs were reduced in four of the five MCS patients, and the TEPs were bilaterally absent in one MCS patient. Among the VS patients, five did not manifest ipsilateral or contralateral TEPs, and three of the patients exhibited only ipsilateral TEPs with reduced amplitudes. The SEPs were altered in five VS and two MCS patients but did not correlate with the clinical diagnosis. The ERPs were impaired in all patients and did not correlate with the clinical diagnosis. These TEP results suggest that cortical reactivity and connectivity are severely impaired in all VS patients, whereas in most MCS patients, the TEPs are preserved but with abnormal features.

While these investigations show promise, investigations to date have neglected to consider the possible effect of 1\u00a0Hz rTMS on other functions of the auditory cortex of these individuals, such as auditory processing. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This placebo-controlled pilot study aimed to determine whether 1\u00a0Hz rTMS applied to the primary auditory cortex (PAC), specifically Brodmann Area 41 (BA41), of adults with chronic, bilateral tinnitus would influence their auditory processing abilities. METHODS: Eight participants with bilateral, chronic tinnitus were randomized to receive a 10-day course of neuronavigationally guided active rTMS (n\u00a0=\u00a04) or placebo rTMS (n\u00a0=\u00a04) treatment applied to a focal region of the left PAC (BA41). Participants' auditory processing was measured using Time Compressed Reverberant Speech and three-pair Dichotic Digits (DD). Their tinnitus was measured using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and a psychoacoustic measure of tinnitus perception. All outcome measures were administered at baseline (1\u00a0week prior to rTMS), 1 week, 1, 2 and 3\u00a0months post-rTMS. RESULTS: All four participants in the active rTMS (A) group, and none of the participants in the sham (placebo) rTMS (S) group, showed improved auditory processing scores at multiple assessment points post-stimulation, with the group differences in median normalized gain scores reaching significance at the 5% level from 1\u00a0week or 1\u00a0month post-stimulation onwards.

We hypothesized that potential interaction between MT and iTBS would be dependent on BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which is known to affect neuroplasticity in the human motor cortex. Eighty two healthy volunteers were genotyped for BDNF polymorphism. Thirty subjects were assigned for MT alone, 23 for iTBS alone, and 29 for MT + iTBS paradigms. TMS indices for cortical excitability and motor map areas were measured prior to and after each paradigm. MT alone significantly increased the motor cortical excitability and expanded the motor map areas. The iTBS alone paradigm also enhanced excitability and increased the motor map areas to a slightly greater extent than MT alone. A combination of MT and iTBS resulted in the largest increases in the cortical excitability, and the representational motor map expansion of MT + iTBS was significantly greater than MT or iTBS alone only in Val/Val genotype. As a result, the additive interaction between MT and iTBS was highly dependent on BDNF Val66Met polymorphism.

Yet, neurophysiological evidences on the nature of interhemispheric interactions during mental movements are still meagre. Here, we asked whether the content of mental images, investigated by task complexity, is finely represented in the inhibitory interactions between the two primary motor cortices (M1s). Subjects' left M1 was stimulated by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while they were performing actual or mental movements of increasing complexity with their right hand and exerting a maximum isometric force with their left thumb and index. Thus, we simultaneously assessed the corticospinal excitability in the right opponent pollicis muscle (OP) and the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) in the left OP during actual and mental movements. Corticospinal excitability in right OP increased during actual and mental movements, but task complexity-dependent changes were only observed during actual movements. Interhemispheric motor inhibition in the left OP was similarly modulated by task complexity in both mental and actual movements. Precisely, the duration and the area of the iSP increased with task complexity in both movement conditions.

Cholinergic dysfunction may contribute to its pathophysiology and can be assessed using short latency afferent inhibition. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with PD (11 cognitively normal; 11 with mild cognitive impairment) and 22 controls participated. Short latency afferent inhibition was measured by conditioning motor evoked potentials, which were elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex with electrical stimuli delivered to the contralateral median nerve at varying interstimulus intervals. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between cognitively normal PD and controls for short latency afferent inhibition (62.8\u00b130.3% vs. 55.7\u00b121.7%; P=0.447). The PD-mild cognitive impairment group had significantly less inhibition (88.4\u00b125.8%) than both cognitively normal PD (P=0.021) and controls (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cholinergic dysfunction occurs early in those with PD -mild cognitive impairment.

To ascertain the causal involvement of S1, and its possible hemispheric lateralization, in encoding the affective valence of emotional scenes, depicting, or not, a tactile event, we gave to healthy participants a picture-based affective go/no-go task and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was chosen as control site. rTMS over the right, but not the left, S1 selectively increased the participants' latencies in the affective go/no-go task, but only when the affective state was conveyed by touch; intriguingly, this interfering effect was associated with the empathic ability to adopt the subjective perspective of others. The left, not the right, DLPFC is also involved in affective go/no-go performance, but regardless of the sight of touch, and independently of empathic abilities.

In animals, behavioral variability is critical for the motor exploration required to select the action that optimizes reward and minimizes cost/punishment and is guided by dopamine (DA). The aim of this study was to test in humans whether low-level movement parameters are affected by punishment and reward in ways similar to high-level action selection. Moreover, we addressed the proposed dependence of behavioral and neurophysiological variability on DA and whether this may underpin the exploration of kinematic parameters. Participants performed an out-and-back index finger movement and were instructed that monetary reward and punishment were based on its maximal acceleration (MA). In fact, the feedback was not contingent on the participant's behavior but predetermined. Blocks highly biased toward punishment were associated with increased MA variability relative to blocks either with reward or without feedback. This increase in behavioral variability was positively correlated with neurophysiological variability, as measured by changes in corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex. Following the administration of a DA antagonist, the variability associated with punishment diminished and the correlation between behavioral and neurophysiological variability no longer existed. Similar changes in variability were not observed when participants executed a predetermined MA, nor did DA influence resting neurophysiological variability. Thus, under conditions of punishment, DA-dependent processes influence the selection of low-level movement parameters. We propose that the enhanced behavioral variability reflects the exploration of kinematic parameters for less punishing, or conversely more rewarding, outcomes.", "pages": "187-791"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Neuromodulation for brain disorders: challenges and opportunities.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "23473040", "authors": ["Johnson, MD", "Lim, HH", "Netoff, TI", "Connolly, AT", "Johnson, N", "Roy, A", "Holt, A", "Lim, KO", "Carey, JR", "Vitek, JL", "He, B"], "year": "2013", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "abstract": "Although most health insurance plans do not cover repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of major depression, coverage is increasing, with approval often granted on a case-by-case basis.
