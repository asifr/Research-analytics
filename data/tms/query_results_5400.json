We examined reflex organization in the sensorimotor cortex. Subjects performed point-to-point arm movements into predictable force fields. When a small perturbation was applied just before the arm encountered the force field, reflex responses in the shoulder muscles changed according to the upcoming force field direction, indicating anticipatory reflex gain modulation. However, when a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied before the reflex response to such perturbations so that the silent period caused by TMS overlapped the reflex processing period, this modulation was abolished, while the reflex itself remained. Loss of reflex gain modulation could not be explained by reduced reflex amplitudes nor by peripheral effects of TMS on the muscles themselves. Instead, we suggest that TMS disrupted interneuronal networks in the sensorimotor cortex, which contribute to reflex gain modulation rather than reflex generation.

A second aim was to examine whether the pattern of facilitation would be affected by age. Corticomotor facilitation was determined in two groups of participants (young n = 21, 24 +/- 2 years; old n = 19, 62 +/- 6 years) by monitoring changes in the amplitude and latency of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited in hand muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation. MEP responses were measured from both the first dorsal interosseous (FDI, task selective muscle) and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) of the right hand while participants attended to four different video presentations. Each of four videos provided specific instructions for participants to either: (1) close their eyes and relax (REST), (2) observe the action attentively (OBS), (3) close their eyes and mentally simulate the action (IMAG), or (4) imitate the action (IMIT). The action depicted in the videos represented a male subject cutting a piece of material with scissors. In the young group, the pattern of results revealed selective facilitation in the FDI in conditions involving either covert (OBS and IMAG) or overt action execution (IMIT). In the ADM, only overt execution with action imitation was associated with significant MEP facilitation. In the old group, a similar pattern of results was observed, although the modulation was less selective than that seen in the young group. In fact, older individuals often exhibited concomitant facilitation in both the FDI and ADM during either covert (OBS and IMAG conditions) or overt action execution (IMIT condition). Taken together, these results further corroborate the notion that the corticomotor system is selectively active when actions are covertly executed through internal simulation triggered by observation or by motor imagery, as proposed by Jeannerod (Neuroimage 14:S103-S109, 2001). With aging, the ability to produce corticomotor facilitation in association with covert action execution appears to be largely preserved, although there seems to be a loss in selectivity. This lack of selectivity may, in turn, reflect age-related alterations in the function of the corticospinal system, which may impair the ability to individuate finger movements either in the covert or overt stage of action execution.", "pages": "1963-6"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Comparison of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy in unipolar non-psychotic refractory depression: a randomized, single-blind study.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16924489", "authors": ["Rosa, MA", "Gattaz, WF", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F", "Rosa, MO", "Rumi, DO", "Myczkowski, M", "Silva, MF", "Mansur, C", "Rigonatti, SP", "Jacobsen Teixeira, M", "Marcolin, MA"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)", "abstract": "GABAergic intracortical inhibition (ICI) in human motor cortex (M1) assists fractionated activation of muscles, and it has been suggested that hemispheric differences in ICI may contribute to hand preference. Previous studies of this issue have all been conducted at rest, with conflicting results. Testing during voluntary activation may reveal functionally relevant differences. In normal subjects, we assessed (1) operation of ICI circuits during selective activation of an intrinsic hand muscle at different forces, and (2) whether this differs between right and left hemispheres. Surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in eleven right-handed subjects. A circular coil applied paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with posteriorly directed current in the brain. Conditioning intensity was 0.8 x active threshold and interstimulus interval was 3 ms. TMS was applied to right or left M1 while subjects were at rest or performing isometric thumb abduction at different forces (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 N) with the contralateral hand. Conditioning TMS was less effective at suppressing the muscle evoked potential in APB during 2-10 N thumb abduction (P < 0.0001) versus rest, but not with lower target forces (0.5, 1 N). Conditioning TMS was less effective for FDI and ADM only during 10 N thumb abduction. We conclude that differential modulation of ICI in M1 during selective muscle activation is a function of target isometric force level. At low forces (<5% MVC), ICI is not modulated for the corticospinal neurons controlling the active or inactive muscles. There is a progressive reduction of ICI effects on corticospinal neurons at higher forces, which is largely restricted to corticospinal neurons controlling the muscle targeted for activation over the range of forces tested (up to approximately 25% MVC). The pattern of ICI modulation with selective voluntary muscle contraction was similar in left and right hemispheres during this relatively simple static task. If hemispheric differences in operation of M1 ICI circuits contribute to hand preference, a more challenging finger movement protocol may be needed to demonstrate this asymmetry.", "pages": "1963-6"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "The two sides of associative plasticity in writer's cramp.", "issue": "Pt 10", "pmid": "16923778", "authors": ["Weise, D", "Schramm, A", "Stefan, K", "Wolters, A", "Reiners, K", "Naumann, M", "Classen, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Abnormalities in brain motor system function are present following spinal cord injury (SCI) and could reduce effectiveness of restorative interventions.

Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) were analysed to assess cortex excitability. The MEPs in response to single pulse TMS were gradually increased in the premovement period in general, but strongly augmented in a period of 90-100 ms before the voluntary myoelectrical activity (EMG) onset. In paired-pulse TMS (13 ms ISI), the MEP augmentation was smaller but started earlier before the EMG burst, and a gradual increase of MEP amplitudes was not evident. In case of 3 ms ISI, the expected intracortical inhibition (ICI) was evident only when TMS preceded the voluntary EMG by an interval of more than 60 ms, but at shorter intervals, rather some MEP augmentation was observed. Generally, the augmentation of MEPs in the premovement period was more pronounced in single pulse TMS. Most strikingly, a dead band period without MEP occurrences was observed within an interval of 30-50 ms before the voluntary EMG.

Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined repetitive electric stimulation of the median or ulnar nerve (MN or UN) with subsequent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral dominant motor cortex at 21.5 ms (MN-PAS21.5; UN-PAS21.5) or 10 ms (MN-PAS10).

Following MN-PAS21.5 or UN-PAS21.5 in non-dystonic subjects, motor responses increased if the afferent PAS-component came from a homologous peripheral region and remained stable with a non-homologous input. In contrast, following either MN-PAS21.5 or UN-PAS21.5, both APB- and ADM-amplitudes increased in patients. Compared with controls, this increase started earlier, its magnitude was larger and its duration longer. Following MN-PAS10 in controls, APB-amplitudes decreased, while ADM-amplitudes increased. In writer's cramp, the decrease of APB-amplitudes started earlier and lasted longer. Of note, ADM-amplitudes were decreased, too.

Tendon vibration of a limb excites the muscle spindle afferents that contribute to eliciting illusory movements of the limb. After the cessation of vibration, a transient sensation in which the vibrated limb returns towards its original position (kinesthetic aftereffect) is often experienced, even in the absence of the afferent inputs recruited by the vibration. We vibrated the tendon of either the right wrist extensor or flexor muscle that elicited an illusory flexion or extension movement, which was followed by its corresponding extension or flexion aftereffect. First, we psychophysically investigated how the preceding illusory movement affects the aftereffect. Second, we examined the cortico-spinal excitability during the aftereffect to evaluate its changes from the time during the illusion. We measured the amplitude of the motor-evoked potential that is evoked by a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the hand section of the contralateral motor cortex (M1). All 19 subjects experienced the aftereffect, and the amount of aftereffect was approximately 70% of the preceding illusion. During the illusion, the cortico-spinal excitability increased more in non-vibrated than in vibrated muscle, so as to reflect the illusory directions. During the aftereffect, the excitability was significantly reduced only in the non-vibrated muscle, with no change in the vibrated muscle, which, in turn, caused an opposite pattern in the unbalanced excitability between the two muscles, and the degree of unbalanced excitability was correlated with the sensation of aftereffect. The kinesthetic aftereffect seems to be elicited by a sensory process that is determined by the preceding illusory movements. Motor-cortical processing of the unbalanced sensory information from the stimulated and non-stimulated muscles may contribute to the elicitation of kinesthetic aftereffect.", "pages": "1963-6"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Concurrent TMS-fMRI and psychophysics reveal frontal influences on human retinotopic visual cortex.", "issue": "15", "pmid": "15634727", "authors": ["Ruff, CC", "Blankenburg, F", "Bjoertomt, O", "Bestmann, S", "Freeman, E", "Haynes, JD", "Rees, G", "Josephs, O", "Deichmann, R", "Driver, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can reduce cortical excitability.

Eight healthy subjects (mean age 26.9 +/- 3.1) underwent 1 Hz frequency rTMS delivered on the right cerebellar hemisphere.

Five different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) were used to assess SICI (2 and 4 ms) and ICF (7, 10 and 15 ms). Amplitude of the responses was expressed as the percentage of motor evoked potential (MEP) to test stimulus alone. Results showed a significant decrease of ICF at 10 ms ISI that persisted up to 20 min after cerebellar rTMS.

These effects selectively suppress the sustained component of responses to flashed spots or moving grating stimuli and are the result of loss of spikes fired in tonic mode, whereas the number of spikes fired in bursts remain the same. We conclude that acute inactivation of the corticogeniculate downflow selectively affects the tonic mode.

M waves, voluntary activation, F waves, resting motor threshold (rMT), recruitment curves (100-140% of rMT), and short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation were measured. Moreover, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and cortical silent periods were determined during brief isometric maximum right index finger abductions. Hypoxia was induced by breathing a fraction of inspired oxygen of 12% via a face mask. M waves, voluntary activation, and F waves did not differ between NX and HX. The rMT was significantly lower in HX (55.79 +/- 9.40%) than in NX (57.50 +/- 10.48%) (P < 0.01), whereas MEP recruitment curve, short-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, maximum right index finger abduction, and MEPs were unaffected by HX. In contrast, the cortical silent periods in HX (158.21 +/- 33.96 ms) was significantly shortened compared with NX (169.42 +/- 39.69 ms) (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of topiramate (TPM) at different doses on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the facilitation of the MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in eight patients before and after treatment with TPM at different doses for chronic neuropathic pain. In each patient, rTMS (5 Hz frequency-120% resting motor threshold) was applied at baseline and during the TPM induction phase (drug intake schedule: week I 25 mg/day, week II 50 mg/day, week III 75 mg/day, week IV 100 mg/day) and total TPM plasma concentrations were measured. The effects on the MEP size of 5 Hz-rTMS delivered over repeated sessions were tested in eight control subjects. TPM had no effect on the resting motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment at increasing doses abolished the normal rTMS-induced MEP facilitation. ANOVA showed that this was a dose-related effect. Accordingly, in patients receiving TPM at higher doses (75 and 100 mg) rTMS failed to elicit the MEP facilitation. TPM left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. In control subjects, rTMS applied over repeated sessions elicited a constant increase in MEP size. Our results suggest that TPM modulates the excitatory intracortical interneurons probably by altering rTMS-induced synaptic potentiation. These drug-induced effects are related to TPM doses and plasma concentrations.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that musical training can result in structural and functional plasticity in the brains of musicians, and that this plasticity is greater for those who begin training early in life. However, previous studies have not controlled for differences between early-trained (ET) and late-trained (LT) musicians in the total number of years of musical training and experience. In the present experiment, we tested musicians who began training before and after the age of 7 on learning of a timed motor sequence task. The groups were matched for years of musical experience, years of formal training and hours of current practice. Results showed that ET musicians performed better than LT musicians, and that this performance advantage persisted after 5 days of practice. Performance differences were greatest for a measure of response synchronization, suggesting that early training has its greatest effect on neural systems involved in sensorimotor integration and timing. These findings support the idea that there may be a sensitive period in childhood where enriched motor training through musical practice results in long-lasting benefits for performance later in life.
