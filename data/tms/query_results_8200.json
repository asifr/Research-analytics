We therefore conducted a functional study of the cerebral loci processing human volitional swallowing with 15O-labeled water positron emission tomography (PET) activation imaging. Regional cerebral activation was investigated in 8 healthy right handed male volunteers with a randomized 12-scan paradigm of rest and water swallows (5 ml/bolus, continuous infusion) at increasing frequencies of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 Hz, which were visually cued and monitored with submental electromyogram (EMG).

In five of eight subjects, the cortical motor representation of pharynx was subsequently mapped with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a posthoc manner to substantiate findings of hemispheric differences in sensorimotor cortex activation seen with PET. During swallowing, group PET analysis identified increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) (P < 0.001) within bilateral caudolateral sensorimotor cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 3, 4, and 6], right anterior insula (BA 16), right orbitofrontal and temporopolar cortex (BA 11 and 38), left mesial premotor cortex (BA 6 and 24), left temporopolar cortex and amygdala (BA 38 and 34), left superiomedial cerebellum, and dorsal brain stem.

Individual PET analysis revealed asymmetric representation within sensorimotor cortex in six of eight subjects, four lateralizing to right hemisphere and two to left hemisphere. TMS mapping in the five subjects identified condordant interhemisphere asymmetries in the motor representation for pharynx, consistent with the PET findings. We conclude that volitional swallowing recruits multiple cerebral regions, in particular sensorimotor cortex, insula, temporopolar cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem, the sensorimotor cortex displaying strong degrees of interhemispheric asymmetry, further substantiated with TMS.

Since the unconditioned motor threshold was lower during voluntary tonic contraction than at rest (31.9+/-5.4% vs. 45.6+/-7.5%), it is suggested that the difference between active and resting motor threshold indicates the magnitude of the voluntary drive on the cortico-muscular pathway. Therefore, we compared conditioned resting and active motor threshold (cRMT and cAMT) during the SP. cRMT showed an intensity-dependent period of elevation of more than 200 ms in duration and approximately 17% of the maximum stimulator output above the unconditioned threshold, due to decreased excitability of the cortico-muscular pathway after the conditioning stimulus. Some 3040 ms after the conditioning stimulus, cAMT approximated cRMT, indicating complete suppression of the voluntary motor drive. This suppression did not start directly after the conditioning stimulus since cAMT was still significantly lower than the cRMT within the first 30-40 ms. Threshold elevation was significantly longer than the SP (220+/-41 vs. 151+/-28 ms). Recovery of the voluntary motor drive started late in the SP and was nearly complete at the end of the SP, although thresholds were still significantly elevated. We conclude that the SP is largely due to a suppression of voluntary motor drive, while the threshold elevation is a different inhibitory phenomenon that is of less importance for the generation of the SP, at least in its late part.

TMS can disrupt cognitive functions for a few tens of milliseconds (although some effects of TMS can be seen for longer), with spatial resolution in the order of a centimetre and therefore allows one to study the role of brain areas without the masking effects of cortical reorganisation. The spatial and temporal resolutions are not unique to TMS but because TMS can be used as a temporary interference technique, it has a functional resolution with which one can address questions beyond the range of other neuroimaging and patient studies.

Our goal was to evaluate, for different levels and severity of spinal cord injury, potential differences in the distribution and latency of motor responses in a large sample of muscles affected by the injury. The spinal cord injury (SCI) population was divided into subgroups based upon injury location (cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar) and clinical status (motor-complete versus motor-incomplete). Cortical stimuli were delivered while subjects attempted to contract individual muscles, in order to both maximize the probability of a response to TMS and minimize the response latency. Subjects with motor-incomplete injuries to the cervical or thoracic spinal cord were more likely to demonstrate volitional and TMS-evoked contractions in muscles controlling their foot and ankle (i.e., distal lower limb muscles) compared to muscles of the thigh (i.e., proximal lower limb muscles). When TMS did evoke responses in muscles innervated at levels caudal to the spinal cord lesion, response latencies of muscles in the lower limbs were delayed equally for persons with injury to the cervical or thoracic spinal cord, suggesting normal central motor conduction velocity in motor axons caudal to the lesion. In fact, motor response distribution and latencies were essentially indistinguishable for injuries to the cervical or thoracic (at or rostral to T10) levels of the spine. In contrast, motor-incomplete SCI subjects with injuries at the thoracolumbar level showed a higher probability of preserved volitional movements and TMS-evoked contractions in proximal muscles of the lower limb, and absent responses in distal muscles. When responses to TMS were seen in this group, the latencies were not significantly longer than those of able-bodied (AB) subjects, strongly suggestive of \"root sparing\" as a basis for motor function in subjects with injury at or caudal to the T11 vertebral body. Both the distribution and latency of TMS-evoked responses are consistent with highly focal lesions to the spinal cord in the subjects examined.

Of the natural motor tasks, duration of SPs of small hand muscles was longest during tactile exploration (APB 205+/-42 ms; FDI 213+/-47 ms). SP duration at tonic isometric contraction amounted to 172+/-35 ms in APB and 178+/-31 ms in FDI, respectively. SP duration in FDI was shortest when elicited during visually guided isometric finger movements (159+/-15 ms). At tonic isometric contraction, SP was shortened when PES was applied at latencies -30 to +70 ms in conjunction with TMS. The latter effect was most pronounced when PES was applied 20 ms before TMS. PES-induced effects increased with increasing stimulation strength up to a saturation level which appeared at the transition to painful stimulation strengths. Both isolated stimulation of muscle afferents and of low-threshold cutaneous afferents shortened SP duration. However, PES of the contralateral median nerve had no effect on SPs.

The patients had no functionally relevant motor disturbances in daily life or on clinical testing. Corticospinally mediated excitatory (response thresholds, amplitudes, central motor latencies) and inhibitory [duration of postexcitatory inhibition (PI)] effects of fTMS were investigated in contralateral hand muscles. Transcallosal inhibition (TI) (onset latency, duration, transcallosal latency) of tonic electromyographic (EMG) activity was tested in ipsilateral muscles. Peripheral motor latencies were determined for responses elicited by magnetic stimulation over cervical nerve roots. Ten normal subjects served as controls. Since in all PKU patients, central and peripheral motor latencies were normal, no neurophysiological indication of a demyelination of corticospinal or peripheral motor fibres was found. However, cortical thresholds of corticospinally mediated responses were increased (52.1, SD 11.6% versus 35.0, SD 7.4% of maximum stimulator output; P < 0.05; n = 24 hands) and their amplitudes reduced (2.9, SD 1.4 mV versus 6.1, SD 1.5 mV, P < 0.05). The duration of PI was shortened (132, SD 53 ms versus 178, SD 57 ms; P < 0.05). TI was absent in 37.5% of the investigated hands or tended to be weak. When TI was present, its onset latencies (38.0, SD 3.6 ms versus 34.7, SD 3.3 ms) and transcallosal latencies were prolonged (18.5, SD 3.8 ms versus 14.8, SD 3.2 ms), while its duration was normal. These abnormal excitatory and inhibitory effects of fTMS suggest a reduced susceptibility of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuronal structures compatible with a loss of neurons or a rarefication of their dendrites.", "pages": "113-6"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Motor evoked potentials in unilateral lingual paralysis after monohemispheric ischaemia.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "10080380", "authors": ["Muellbacher, W", "Artner, C", "Mamoli, B"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "In a previous study where reaction-time methods were combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex, cortico-spinal excitability was shown to reflect time preparation. Provided that subjects can accurately estimate time, the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) diminish progressively during the interval separating the warning signal from the response signal (i.e., the foreperiod). On the other hand, several experiments have demonstrated that the amplitude of the Hoffman (H) reflex elicited in prime movers diminishes during the foreperiod of reaction-time tasks. The aim of the present study was to compare the time course of the respective decrements of H-reflex and MEP amplitude during a constant 500-ms foreperiod. The subjects (n=8) participated in two experimental sessions. In one session, H-reflexes were induced in a tonically activated, responding hand muscle, the flexor pollicis brevis, at different times during the foreperiod of a visual-choice reaction-time task. In the other session, motor potentials were evoked in the same muscle by TMS of the motor cortex delivered in the same behavioral conditions and at the same times as in the first session. The results show that both H-reflexes and MEPs diminish in amplitude during the foreperiod, which replicates and extends previous findings. Interestingly, the time constants of the two decrements differed. There was a facilitatory effect of both electrical and magnetic stimulations on the subject's performance: reaction time was shorter for the trials during which a stimulation was delivered than for the no-stimulation trials. This facilitation was maximal when the stimulations were delivered simultaneously with the warning signal and vanished progressively with stimulation time.", "pages": "113-6"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "The human motor cortex after incomplete spinal cord injury: an investigation using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "10080379", "authors": ["Puri, BK", "Smith, HC", "Cox, IJ", "Sargentoni, J", "Savic, G", "Maskill, DW", "Frankel, HL", "Ellaway, PH", "Davey, NJ"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The compound muscle action potentials elicited from the erector spinae muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation was studied in 15 healthy adults.", "pages": "113-6"}, {"volume": "513 ( Pt 2)", "title": "The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on the soleus H reflex during human walking.", "issue": "", "pmid": "10080378", "authors": ["Petersen, N", "Christensen, LO", "Nielsen, J"], "year": "1998", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "To describe the recording procedure for consistent compound muscle action potentials elicited from the human erector spinae by transcranial magnetic stimulation and to establish the normal latency ranges of the responses, at respective spinal levels, for the practical use of this test.", "pages": "113-6"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Fast corticospinal system and motor performance in children: conduction proceeds skill.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10080377", "authors": ["Heinen, F", "Fietzek, UM", "Berweck, S", "Hufschmidt, A", "Deuschl, G", "Korinthenberg, R"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Pediatric neurology", "abstract": "Although recording of the compound muscle action potentials from limb muscles after transcranial magnetic stimulation has been extensively studied, the use of the erector spinae as the target muscle has not, probably because of the difficulty of consistently evoking compound muscle action potentials.", "pages": "113-6"}, {"volume": "160", "title": "New method to measure central motor conduction time using transcranial magnetic stimulation and T-response.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10080376", "authors": ["Ofuji, A", "Kaneko, K", "Taguchi, T", "Fuchigami, Y", "Morita, H", "Kawai, S"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Compound muscle action potentials from the erector spinae muscles were recorded with the subject prone during tonic voluntary background contraction of the back extensor muscles at approximately 20% of maximum effort.

The motor cortex was activated transcranially using a focal magnetic stimulation coil. For each subject, the entire input-output (I-O) curve [i.e., the integral of the motor evoked-potential (MEP) versus stimulus strength] was measured during a prescribed tonic voluntary contraction of either the tibialis anterior (TA) or the soleus. Similarly, I-O curves were measured in the early part of the swing phase, or in the early part of the stance phase of walking. The I-O data points were fitted by the Boltzmann sigmoidal function, which accounted for >/=80% of total data variance. There was no statistically significant difference between the I-O curves of the TA measured during voluntary ankle dorsiflexion or during the swing phase of walking, at matched levels of background electromyographic (EMG) activity. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the relation between the coefficient of variation and the amplitude of the MEPs measured in each task, respectively. In comparison, during the stance phase of walking the soleus MEPs were reduced on average by 26% compared with their size during voluntary ankle plantarflexion. Furthermore, during stance the MEPs in the inactive TA were enhanced relative to their size during voluntary ankle plantarflexion and in four of six subjects the TA MEPs were larger than those of the soleus. Finally, stimulation of the motor cortex at various phases of the step cycle did not reset the cycle. The time of the next step occurred at the expected moment, as determined from the phase-resetting curve. One interpretation of this result is that the motor cortex may not be part of the central neural system involved in timing the motor bursts during the step cycle. We suggest that during walking the corticospinal tract is more closely linked with the segmental motor circuits controlling the flexor, TA, than it is with those controlling the extensor, soleus. However, during voluntary tasks requiring attention to the level of motor activity, it is equally linked with the segmental motor circuits of ankle flexors or extensors.", "pages": "113-6"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Finger movements induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation change with hand posture, but not with coil position.", "issue": "5-6", "pmid": "10080372", "authors": ["Wassermann, EM", "Tormos, JM", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "To investigate human corticobulbar projections, electromyographic responses from orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles were recorded in 11 healthy subjects after transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Cortico-cortical inhibition and facilitation induced by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human motor cortex were investigated in the distal muscle opponens pollicis (OP) and the proximal muscle biceps brachii (BB) of normal subjects. 2. The test response evoked by TMS (125 % of motor threshold, MTh) in the relaxed OP and BB muscles was inhibited by a conditioning TMS (80 % of MTh) at short interstimulus intervals (ISIs; 2-5 ms) and facilitated at longer ISIs (10-25 ms). The test response was significantly less inhibited at short ISIs and more facilitated at long ISIs in the BB than OP. 3. The MTh at rest was significantly lower for the OP than for the BB, indicating a greater excitability of OP cortical area. However, the above pattern of inhibition and facilitation was preserved both when the stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke test responses of matched size in the two muscles and within an ample range of conditioning stimulus intensities. 4. The use of a circular coil or a focal figure-of-eight coil produced no qualitative differences in the pattern of inhibition and facilitation in either muscle. 5. The significant difference in MTh between muscles was lost during voluntary activation. In both muscles, pre-innervation abolished the cortico-cortical facilitation and reduced the cortico-cortical inhibition. However, the latter remained larger in the OP than BB muscle. 6.
