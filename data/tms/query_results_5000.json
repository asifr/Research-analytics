Deficits in inhibitory processes in cortical brain areas are discussed as possible causes for ADHD. An easy measurement of these processes is provided by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We applied single- and double-pulse TMS to the left motor cortex while an electromyogram (EMG) was taken at the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) of the right hand. Intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) were measured in ten adult ADHD patients and ten healthy participants using inter-pulse intervals of 2 and 3ms (SICI), and 8 and 15ms (ICF). Furthermore, resting motor threshold (RMT) and latency of the motor evoked potential (MEP) following magnetic stimulation were compared. t-Tests were calculated for statistical analysis. TMS measurements resulted in impaired inhibition in ADHD patients, whereas there were no differences in facilitation, RMT and MEP-latency between groups. Large variability in the patient group was found.

Paired-pulse TMS at long interstimulus intervals can also be used to derive an index of long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI), however this has not yet been investigated in fatigue. Our aim was to measure LICI during and after a fatiguing exercise and determine if the changes in the index of LICI parallel the changes in SP duration. To do this, we used single and paired-pulse TMS to measure motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, LICI and SP duration during, and for 10 min after, a 10-min intermittent maximal fatiguing exercise of the index finger, designed to fatigue the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle (force after 10-min of exercise 64 +/- 7% of baseline, P < 0.05). Single-pulse MEP amplitude and SP duration were increased during fatiguing exercise (minute 10; 179 +/- 24% and 128 +/- 9% of baseline, respectively, P < 0.05), in contrast the measure of LICI was reduced compared to baseline (minute 10; 0.45 +/- 0.17 vs. baseline; 0.70 +/- 0.10, P < 0.05). These results suggest that SP duration and LICI may reflect processes occurring in different neuronal populations. The increased SP duration may correspond to processes of central fatigue in centres 'upstream' of primary motor cortex (M1), whereas the decrease in LICI, together with increased MEP amplitude, are consistent with an increase in M1 output during fatigue that may serve to compensate for reduced central drive.", "pages": "137-41"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Transcranial electrostimulation activates reparative regeneration and the insulin-producing function of pancreatic B-cells in alloxan diabetes in rats.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10022491", "authors": ["Lebedev, VP", "Bilichenko, SV", "Ordyan, NE", "Pivina, SG", "Nechiporenko, SP", "Puzyrev, AA", "Mikheeva, EA", "Kubacheva, KK"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroscience and behavioral physiology", "abstract": "To determine whether cortical cholinergic circuit impairment exists in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) brain.", "pages": "137-41"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Magnetic field therapy: a review.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10195110", "authors": ["Markov, MS"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Electromagnetic biology and medicine", "abstract": "Fifteen healthy elderly controls (NC), 16 amnesic MCI subjects and 12 probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects were recruited.

We examined whether neuronal activity in early and later stages differs in its ability to support detectable signals by measuring behavioral thresholds for detecting electrical microstimulation in different cortical areas in two monkeys. By training the animals to perform a two-alternative temporal forced-choice task, we obtained criterion-free thresholds from five visual areas--V1, V2, V3A, MT, and the inferotemporal cortex. Every site tested yielded a reliable threshold. Thresholds varied little within and between visual areas, rising gradually from early to later stages.

One-hundred and two of our subjects who participated in our tDCS studies completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes, during and after tDCS. Participants were healthy subjects (75.5%), migraine patients (8.8%), post-stroke patients (5.9%) and tinnitus patients (9.8%). During tDCS a mild tingling sensation was the most common reported adverse effect (70.6%), moderate fatigue was felt by 35.3% of the subjects, whereas a light itching sensation under the stimulation electrodes occurred in 30.4% of cases. After tDCS headache (11.8%), nausea (2.9%) and insomnia (0.98%) were reported, but fairly infrequently. In addition, the incidence of the itching sensation (p=0.02) and the intensity of tingling sensation (p=0.02) were significantly higher during tDCS in the group of the healthy subjects, in comparison to patients; whereas the occurrence of headache was significantly higher in the patient group (p=0.03) after the stimulation.

Here we studied the extent to which rhythmic movement of the legs alters reflex (Experiment 1) and corticospinal (Experiment 2) transmission to arm muscles. In experiment 1, flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H-reflex recruitment curves were recorded with the legs static, and during rhythmic leg movement, while the FCR was both contracted and relaxed. The results indicate that rhythmic leg movement suppresses reflex transmission, both when FCR is at rest and during tonic contraction, but that the effect is not phase-dependent. In experiment 2, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the contracted and relaxed FCR during static leg, and leg cycling conditions. Sub-threshold TMS was also used to condition H-reflexes in order to provide specific information about cortical excitability during leg cycling. Both resting and tonically contracting arm muscles showed a greater corticospinal excitability during leg cycling than during the static leg condition. The magnitude of TMS facilitation of H-reflexes was similar during leg cycling and rest, suggesting a considerable sub-cortical component to the increased corticospinal excitability.

TMS did cause extreme deviations in the finger's trajectory, and altered the timing perceptions of subjects with schizophrenia. Additionally, it invoked high-level deficiencies related to attention and volition in the form of lapses, implying that the connectivity between modules in the brain that underlie motor control, sensorimotor synchronization, timing perception and awareness of action, can be disrupted by TMS in subjects with schizophrenia, but not in healthy subjects.

Nine chronic subcortical stroke patients and nine age-matched controls underwent functional magnetic brain imaging whilst performing repetitive isometric hand grips. Target grip forces were varied between 15% and 45% of individual maximum grip force. Corticospinal system functional integrity was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Averaged across all forces, there was more task-related activation compared with rest in the secondary motor areas of patients with greater corticospinal system damage, confirming previous reports. However, here we were primarily interested in regional brain activation, which covaried with the amount of force generated, implying a prominent executive role in force production. We found that in control subjects and patients with lesser corticospinal system damage, signal change increased linearly with increasing force output in contralateral primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area and ipsilateral cerebellum. In contrast, in patients with greater corticospinal system damage, force-related signal changes were seen mainly in contralesional dorsolateral premotor cortex, bilateral ventrolateral premotor cortices and contralesional cerebellum, but not ipsilesional primary motor cortex.

In the patient with peripherally induced dystonia, we found a paradoxical intracortical facilitation at short interstimulus intervals of 3 and 5 milliseconds, at which regular intracortical inhibition (ICI) occurred in healthy subjects. These findings suggest that the foot dystonia may have been precipitated as the result of a preexisting abnormality of motor cortex excitability. Furthermore, the abnormality of ICI in her brother and sister indicates that altered motor excitability may be a hereditary predisposition. The study demonstrates that the paired-pulse technique is a useful tool to assess individual vulnerability, which can be particularly relevant when the causal association between trauma and dystonia is less evident.", "pages": "137-41"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Use of transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain in stroke rehabilitation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17428995", "authors": ["Profice, P", "Pilato, F", "Dileone, M", "Ranieri, F", "Capone, F", "Musumeci, G", "A Tonali, P", "Di Lazzaro, V"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Expert review of neurotherapeutics", "abstract": "Functional brain mapping may be useful for both preoperative planning and intraoperative neurosurgical decision making. \"Gold standard\" functional studies such as direct electrical stimulation and recording are complemented by newer, less invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. Less invasive techniques allow more areas of the brain to be mapped in more subjects (including healthy subjects) more often (including pre- and postoperatively). Expansion of the armamentarium of tools allows convergent evidence from multiple brain mapping techniques to bear on pre- and intraoperative decision making. Functional imaging techniques are used to map motor, sensory, language, and memory areas in neurosurgical patients with conditions as diverse as brain tumors, vascular lesions, and epilepsy. In the future, coregistration of high resolution anatomic and physiological data from multiple complementary sources will be used to plan more neurosurgical procedures, including minimally invasive procedures. Along the way, new insights on fundamental processes such as the biology of tumors and brain plasticity are likely to be revealed.", "pages": "137-41"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Motor cortex stimulation for intractable pain.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "17611260", "authors": ["Osenbach, RK"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of interest in brain stimulation techniques as therapies for psychiatric disorders.
