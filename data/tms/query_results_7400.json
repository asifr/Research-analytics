EEG signals were collected at 14 electrode sites before and after stimulation, and were filtered digitally into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a relatively new method to investigate corticospinal physiology, has been widely used to assess possible changes secondary to Parkinson's disease (PD). The use of single- and paired-pulse TMS, two varieties of the original technique, disclosed multiple functional alterations of the corticospinal pathway. For instance, when the latter was tested at 'rest', or in response to somesthetic afferents, it showed excess excitability or reduced inhibition. In turn, during production of a voluntary output, its activation was defective, or inadequately modulated. One major mechanism may be a dysfunction of the interneurons mediating the level of excitation within cortical area 4. For instance, there is a shortening of the so-termed 'central silent period', which is a complex, TMS-induced, inhibitory phenomenon possibly mediated by activation of GABA(B) receptors. The so-called 'short-interval intracortical inhibition', which is possibly mediated by GABA(A) receptors, is also diminished. Levodopa restores these and other TMS alterations, thus demonstrating that cortical area 4 is sensitive to dopamine modulation. Overall, TMS has provided substantial new pathophysiological insights, which point to a central role of the primary motor cortex in the movement disorder typical of PD. Repetitive (r-)TMS, another form of TMS, has been studied as a treatment for PD motor signs. Although some reports are favorable, others are not, and have raised the problem of appropriate control experiments. Although extremely interesting, the potential therapeutic role of r-TMS in PD needs further evaluation.", "pages": "341-5"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Segregation of areas related to visual working memory in the prefrontal cortex revealed by rTMS.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11884352", "authors": ["Mottaghy, FM", "Gangitano, M", "Sparing, R", "Krause, BJ", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Growing evidence implicates an overactivity of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of essential tremor.

This repeated \"dual\" stimulation induced significant changes in the excitability of the motor cortex together with expansion of the area of scalp from which these responses were elicited. The expansion in muscle representation was accompanied by large movements in the centre of gravity (CoG), suggesting a true reorganisation of the underlying cortical representational zone.

It is concluded that repeated dual stimulation is capable of inducing long-lasting reorganisation within the motor cortex.

As a simple approach to assessing activation of the visual cortex, subjects can be asked to report conscious subjective light sensations (phosphenes) elicited by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the occiput. We hypothesized that such induction of phosphenes can be used as an indicator of residual function of the visual cortex and studied 35 registered blind subjects after partial or complete long-term (>10 years) deafferentation of the visual cortex due to pregeniculate lesions. TMS was applied over the visual cortex in 10 blind subjects with some residual vision (visual acuity <20/400; Group 1), 15 blind subjects with very poor residual vision (only perception of movement or light; Group 2), 10 blind subjects without any residual vision (Group 3) and 10 healthy controls. A stimulation mapping procedure was performed on a 1 x 1 cm skull surface grid with 130 stimulation points overlying the occipital skull. We analysed the occurrence of phosphenes at each stimulation point with regard to frequency and location of phosphenes in the visual field. Previous experiments have shown that repetitive TMS reliably elicits brief flashes of white or coloured patches of light. Therefore, stimulation was performed with short trains of seven consecutive 15 Hz stimuli applied with an intensity of 1.3 times the motor threshold. Under such conditions, phosphenes occurred in 100% of subjects in Group 1, in 60% of Group 2 and in 20% of Group 3. Phosphene thresholds were normal, but the number of effective stimulation sites was significantly reduced in Groups 2 and 3. The results indicate that in blind subjects there is alteration in TMS-induced activation of the deafferented visual cortex or processes engaged in bringing the artificial cortex input to consciousness.

During INH, inhibitory control of the motor memory trace was confirmed by significant amplitude reduction of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) compared with baseline. This was accompanied by a significant increase of 11-13 Hz oscillatory activity over the sensorimotor areas during INH. During active retrieval of the motor memory traces, the reverse was true (increased MEP amplitudes, decreased oscillatory 11-13 Hz activity). In a small sample of dystonic patients (n = 6), the increase of 11-13 Hz oscillatory activity during INH was consistently absent. The present data demonstrate for the first time cortical correlates of appropriate, context-dependent inhibition of motor memory traces. We propose that focal increases of oscillatory activity are instrumental for inhibitory control at the cortical level. This concept is supported by the preliminary observations in dystonic patients who are known to have deficits of inhibitory motor control and in whom these context-dependent focal increases of oscillatory activity were absent.", "pages": "341-5"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Subjective reactions of children to single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "11819037", "authors": ["Garvey, MA", "Kaczynski, KJ", "Becker, DA", "Bartko, JJ"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of child neurology", "abstract": "In patients with degenerative ataxia, various abnormalities in motor cortex activation by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been observed, including a reduction of intracortical facilitation and a lengthening of the silent period.

The aim of our present study was to investigate whether differences in motor cortex activation by TMS could be observed in genetically defined subtypes of degenerative ataxia. We examined six patients with Friedreich's ataxia, three patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, seven patients with SCA2, 12 patients with SCA3, nine patients with SCA6 and 14 healthy controls. In all subjects, motor threshold, central motor conduction time, cortical silent period after TMS, and intracortical inhibition and facilitation (as assessed by TMS using a paired pulses paradigm) were determined. Additionally, F wave amplitudes evoked by electrical peripheral nerve stimulation were measured. We found a significant reduction of intracortical facilitation in SCA2 and SCA3 patients. Furthermore, motor threshold was elevated in SCA1, central motor conduction time was lengthened in patients with Friedreich's ataxia and SCA1, and F wave amplitudes were enlarged in all the genetic subgroups except for SCA6. Silent period and intracortical inhibition did not differ between patients and controls. We conclude that changes of intracortical facilitation induced by TMS and other excitability parameters of the motor system are not a common phenomenon in degenerative ataxia, but are restricted to specific subtypes.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cortical activities during two types of Go/NoGo task with different movement instructions (Push-Go and Release-Go) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and event-related potential (ERP) recordings. In the Push-Go condition, ten subjects were instructed either to push a button with their right index finger as fast as possible after a Go signal or not to push it after a NoGo signal. In the Release-Go condition, they were asked beforehand to continually depress a button by pushing, and instructed either to release it as fast as possible after a Go signal or not to release it after a NoGo signal. TMS was applied to the left primary motor cortex at 20--300 ms after each signal. In the Push-Go condition trials, the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle significantly increased at 120--300 ms after the Go signals and decreased at 160--200 ms after the NoGo signals. In contrast, the MEP amplitudes recorded during the Release-Go condition trials significantly decreased at 160--300 ms after the Go signals and significantly increased at 160--180 and 220--300 ms after the NoGo signals. On the other hand, the ERPs recorded in the frontocentral cortex after each signal for five of the subjects were identical in both the Push-Go and Release-Go condition trials. These results indicated that, while the cortical activities related to the Go/NoGo decision were similar in the two task conditions, the corticospinal excitability was modulated so as to suppress or facilitate the required Go responses depending on the given movement instructions. This suggests that the Go/NoGo decision may be separate from the subsequent motor program.", "pages": "341-5"}, {"volume": "82", "title": "Combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation evidence of ipsilateral motor pathway with congenital brain disorder: a case report.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "11784802", "authors": ["Jang, SH", "Byun, WM", "Chang, Y", "Han, BS", "Ahn, SH"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation", "abstract": "We report a 77-year-old woman with restless legs syndrome(RLS) and periodic limb movement(PLM). From 62 years of age, she was awakened by tingling and involuntary movement in her legs during sleep. There symptoms disappeared when she stood up and walked. She was treated with clonazepam (2.5 mg/day) and valproate (400 mg/day) at 77 years of age, and the symptoms clearly ameliorated. However, she developed mild truncal ataxia and was referred to our hospital. On admission, neurological examination revealed Babinski and Chaddock signs bilaterally with depressed tendon reflexes in the lower limbs, mild truncal ataxia and horizontal gaze nystagmus. She did not present with involuntary movement of the legs while taking the anti-epileptic drugs. Cessation of these drugs alleviated the truncal ataxia and nystagmus, but reexacerbated abnormal sensation with involuntary movement in her legs during sleep. The involuntary movements in her legs were slower than myoclonus and resembled a Babinski reflex (duration about 1 second), and they appeared periodically (around every 30 seconds) in I-II sleep stages. Neither brain MRI nor EEG detected any abnormality. Cervical MRI revealed focal compression of the spinal cord by osteophytes at C5-C6 (more severe on the left side). Motor evoked potentials with transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed a mild delay in the central conduction time (CCT), which was more prolonged on the left side. She was thus diagnosed as having RLS/PLM with involvement of the bilateral pyramidal tracts. Although nerve conduction studies did not detect any abnormality in the peripheral nerves, RLS/PLM of the left leg was induced by electric stimulation of the left tibial nerve. Because she did not want medication any more, we treated her with a lumbar corset, hoping that wearing a lumbar corset might induce contraction of the truncal muscles that would mimic standing and walking or might produce additional sensory input that would induce a 'sensory trick'. Consequently, her abnormal sensation and involuntary movement during sleep as well as the stimulation of the tibial nerve disappeared. Wearing a lumbar corset may inhibit the excitability of the spinal cord that generates RLS/PLM, though the level of sensory input by the corset was higher than the input level of abnormal sensation in her legs. A lumbar corset may be a useful alternative choice for patients with RLS/PLM, who cannot tolerate either anti-epileptic or dopaminergic drugs.", "pages": "341-5"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Functional MRI of cortical activations induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).", "issue": "16", "pmid": "11784448", "authors": ["Baudewig, J", "Siebner, HR", "Bestmann, S", "Tergau, F", "Tings, T", "Paulus, W", "Frahm, J"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Behavioural studies indicate that a newly acquired motor skill is rapidly consolidated from an initially unstable state to a more stable state, whereas neuroimaging studies demonstrate that the brain engages new regions for performance of the task as a result of this consolidation.

We monitored changes in elementary motor behaviour while subjects practised fast finger movements that rapidly improved in movement acceleration and muscle force generation. Here we show that low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 but not other brain areas specifically disrupted the retention of the behavioural improvement, but did not affect basal motor behaviour, task performance, motor learning by subsequent practice, or recall of the newly acquired motor skill.
