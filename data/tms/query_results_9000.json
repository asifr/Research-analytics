It is unclear whether the abnormality lies at the cortical, subcortical, or segmental level. To obtain evidence for an exaggerated effect on motor cortical excitability, we used peripheral nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation in controls and subjects with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and PME. Mean threshold intensity was higher in those with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and PME than in controls, probably as a result of anticonvulsant treatment. A long-latency response to peripheral stimulation and an exaggerated facilitatory effect of peripheral stimulation on the motor evoked potential was present in subjects with PME. Latency differences between the late responses in the upper and lower limbs provided evidence against a segmental reflex and implicated rapidly conducting fibers in the spinal cord. Both the late response and the facilitatory effect had onset latencies consistent with a transcortical pathway, suggesting an exaggerated effect of afferent input on motor cortical excitability in PME.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain in patients with mesiotemporal epileptic foci.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8420691", "authors": ["Steinhoff, BJ", "Stodieck, SR", "Zivcec, Z", "Schreiner, R", "von Maffei, C", "Plendl, H", "Paulus, W"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Clinical EEG (electroencephalography)", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human brain is mainly used for the diagnosis of diseases with disturbed central motor conduction.

We applied TMS to 19 patients with complex-partial seizures and investigated its effects and safety. In 12 patients we performed TMS during scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings.

It was the aim of the present study to answer the questions of whether this inhibitory action is mainly of cortical or of spinal origin, which brain area generates this inhibition, and whether the duration of PI differs between proximal and distal muscles. Experiments were performed on a total of 34 healthy volunteers. Brain stimuli were delivered with a Novametrix Magstim 200HP with a maximum output of 2.0 T, and stimulation was performed during tonic voluntary activation of the muscle under study. Stimulation strength was 1.5 times threshold level. Duration of PI was defined as the time from the onset of the motor evoked potential to the reoccurrence of the EMG background activity. PI was found more pronounced in distal hand muscles than in proximal arm and leg muscles. The largest PI values were observed when the primary motor cortex was stimulated. To test the excitability of the spinal motoneurones during PI, cortical double stimulation at various intervals was performed and the soleus H-reflex was evoked at different intervals after cortical stimulation. Neither test revealed a decrease in the excitability of the spinal motoneurones during PI.

Profound changes were documented in liminal D waves, there being an increase in amplitude averaging 392% following withdrawal of the volatile anaesthetic. There was a proportionately smaller increase (averaging 26%) in supraliminal D waves; these had a complex bifid or trifid shape indicating that some corticofugal axons were being activated deep to cortex. In general the effect on the D wave of withdrawing the anaesthetic agent was similar to that of increasing stimulus intensity. 3. Withdrawal of isoflurane dramatically increased the number of I waves and their mean amplitude. In the absence of isoflurane, I3 (mean latency 3.5 ms after the D wave) became the dominant I wave. The amplitude of I2 (mean latency 2.2 ms) became slightly smaller. The change in I waves could not be likened to an increase in stimulus intensity, because I waves invariably increase in, or remain of the same, amplitude as stimulus intensity is increased. 4.

We also showed that N1 and N2 of the MEPs-S originated mainly from the lower medulla or upper cervical and that N3 originated from the lower pons or upper medulla (vestibular nucleus). On the other hand, N4 of the MEPs-S had a conduction velocity of 70 m/s, which disappeared by ablation of the sensorimotor cortex and pyramidotomy. A dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord, resulting in the disappearance of N4 of the MEPs-S, indicated that it conducted in the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord. These results suggest that N4 of the MEPs-S originates from the sensorimotor cortex and conducts in the lateral corticospinal tract.

A magnetic coil was placed over the parieto-occipital skull of the subjects for stimulation, and the facial nerve was electrically stimulated in its intracranial and peripheral courses. Then an electromyogram was recorded from the nasalis muscle of the face on the stimulated side. In 9 healthy volunteers, 18 facial nerves received magnetic and electric stimuli in the peripheral region, and the actual site of stimulation was estimated from the conduction velocity of the nerve. The conduction velocity was 56.6 +/- 4.8 m/s, and the latency between CMAPs for electric at the magnetic stimuli to the posterior tragus was 1.23 +/- 0.21 ms. Therefore, the position stimulated by magnetic coil was estimated to be 70.0 +/- 11.4 mm central to the posterior tragus, i.e., near the root exit zone. In two patients undergoing surgery in the cerebellopontine angle, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation of the intracranial facial nerve were compared intraoperatively. The CMAP produced by transcranial magnetic stimulation coincided closely with that produced by direct electrical stimulation of the root exit zone. Thus, the facial nerve was stimulated at the root exit zone, and this method could be expected to be useful for evaluation of disorders of the intracranial facial nerve.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "239", "title": "Neurophysiological evaluation of sensorimotor functions of the leg: comparison of evoked cortical potentials following electrical and mechanical stimulation, long-latency muscle responses, and transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1492992", "authors": ["Ackermann, H", "Thomas, C", "Guschlbauer, B", "Dichgans, J"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "The present study determined the effects of percutaneous electrical stimulation of the plantar surface on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) of normal subjects following transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex. The conditioning stimulation consisted of a 20 msec train of electrical pulses (500 Hz; 0.1 msec rectangular) delivered to the medial border of the sole of the foot at an intensity just subthreshold for evoking a flexion reflex. The conditioning (C) stimulation preceded the test (T) cortical stimulation by intervals of 20-130 msec. Magnetic stimulation of motor cortex (Cadwell MES-10) was delivered through a 9.5 cm focal point coil positioned tangential to the scalp and located with the rim over vertex. Five healthy adults served as subjects and each was investigated on at least 2 occasions. At C-T intervals 20-50 msec there was a mild inhibition of MEPs in both TA and SOL. This was followed by marked facilitation (greater than 300%) of MEPs at C-T intervals 50-85 msec in both TA and SOL in all subjects. At longer C-T intervals greater than 110 msec, there was an inhibition of MEPs in TA but not in SOL. Based on the time course of these 3 phases of MEP amplitude modulation, and different stimulation thresholds for each phase, it appears that separate neurophysiological processes underlie each phase of MEP modulation. These observations also suggest that percutaneous electrical stimulation may be useful as a means of enhancing low amplitude or subliminal MEPs in normal subjects or patients with myelopathy.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in pontine infarction: correlation to degree of paresis.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1431984", "authors": ["Ferbert, A", "Vielhaber, S", "Meincke, U", "Buchner, H"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetoelectrical stimulation (TMS) is now widely used as a diagnostic tool in adults.

The intensity of conditioning ES was adjusted to just subthreshold for evoking flexion reflexes in TA and was delivered at conditioning-test (C-T) intervals of 15-60 msec prior to cortical stimulation. Four subjects with clinically complete SCI revealed no muscle response to cortical stimulation or following combined subliminal percutaneous ES and cortical stimulation. Four subjects (3 clinically incomplete and 1 complete injury) demonstrated muscle responses with a latency of 70-80 msec time-locked to the percutaneous ES when the conditioning subliminal stimulation was delivered at C-T: 15-40 msec. These responses, resembling suprathreshold flexion reflexes, reflect the convergence of excitatory afferent and cortical inputs and provide evidence of preserved corticospinal innervation to the L4-5 segmental motoneuron or interneuron pools. In 3 of the subjects this preserved corticospinal influence was evident despite absence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) following cortical stimulation. The effect of the combined electrical and cortical stimulation in yielding suprathreshold flexion reflexes, instead of the facilitated MEPs seen in control subjects, appears to be related to slowed central conduction, prolonged temporal dispersion of the motoneuron facilitation following cortical stimulation and segmental reflex changes associated with disrupted modulation of interneuronal pathways.

Conversely, reaction time was shortest to either subthreshold transcranial stimulation over the same scalp position or to transcranial stimulation over the ipsilateral motor cortex regardless of intensity. Suprathreshold transcranial stimulation to the motor cortex seems to transiently inhibit the neurons responsible for initiation of motor programs involving muscles in which motor evoked potentials have been induced, thereby prolonging the reaction time.

The cortical source of the paraesthesias was sought by comparing their incidence with that of muscle responses to focal MC stimulation with either a figure 8 MC or with edge stimulation of a tilted round MC in 4 susceptible subjects. In all 4, paraesthesias were best felt with MC stimulation either at, or anterior to sites yielding movement, implying an initial source in precentral gyrus (and possible premotor cortex), rather than parietal cortex. In the two subjects exhibiting the strongest paraesthesias, the threshold for the paraesthesias was less than that for movement in the relaxed arm. The optimal site of the paraesthesias within the hand was usually in the digits, but differed among subjects. Motor responses and paraesthesias following a given stimulus occurred at different sites in the hand, implying that excitation of differing sets of motor cortical neurons subserved sensory and motor responses. In only one subject were the paraesthesias sufficiently reproducible to warrant interacting electrical digital and transcranial MC pulses. The data suggested that central processing of the response to the MC pulse is slowed by an antecedent digital stimulus, but the delay for perception of each type of stimulus does not greatly differ. The central sense of movement (Amassian et al., 1989a) elicited by MC stimulation of motor cortex is compared with the paraesthesias. Both are attributed to brief, high frequency discharge by motor cortical neurons accessing the perceptual system more readily than after excitation of post-central gyrus, which requires prolonged repetitive stimulation (Libet et al., 1964). Given also the normal pattern of muscle responses in the 4 subjects, their paraesthesias are best explained by a heightened sensitivity of the perceptual system to the motor cortical response to MC stimulation.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation topography assessed by distribution and size of evoked potentials.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "3079553", "authors": ["Struppler, A", "Baykoushev, S"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Folia medica", "abstract": "In tonically active human motor neurons serving upper limb muscles there is a late rise in firing probability following transcranial magnetic stimulation termed the secondary peak (SP).

Separate peri-stimulus time histograms, constructed for trials in which the motor unit fired in the primary peak (PP) and those in which it fired in SP, showed that SP was not caused by a resumption of firing after the preceding PP. In the first dorsal interosseous muscle, the observed increase in the interval between PP and SP in patients with either HMSN or MS, when compared with healthy subjects, suggested that the pathway mediating SP had both peripheral and central components. Evidence for a peripheral component was substantiated by the observed slope of the line relating the latency of SP in different upper limb muscles to peripheral conduction distance, which was more than 3 times greater than that for PP, and by comparisons in the same motor unit made between the latency of responses to finger taps and to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Evidence for the origin of SP was consistent with a long loop reflex, or with collateral activation of gamma motor neurons and subsequent motor neuron firing from muscle afferent inputs. SP discharges were found to occur earlier than expected on the basis of the spontaneous motor unit firing rate, suggesting that SP was caused by the rising phase of an excitatory post-synaptic potential, rather than by the decay of an inhibitory postsynaptic potential.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Is there involvement of the central nervous system in hereditary sensory radicular neuropathy?", "issue": "1", "pmid": "2831303", "authors": ["Hageman, G", "Hilhorst, BG", "Rozeboom, AR"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Clinical neurology and neurosurgery", "abstract": "The optimal placement sites for eliciting motor evoked potentials from the abductor digiti minimi and abductor hallucis muscles by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation were determined using a commercially available circular coli.

Magnetic stimulation at rest activated a larger fraction of the motoneuron pool and evoked MEPs with shorter latencies from a larger number of scalp positions in muscles immediately rostral to the level of a spinal cord injury than in corresponding muscles in controls. The MEPs associated with maximal voluntary activation were not significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest enhanced excitability of motor pathways targeting muscles rostral to the level of a spinal transection, reflecting reorganization of motor pathways either within cortical motor representation areas or at the level of the spinal cord. The data do not allow the determination of the contribution of spinal or cortical mechanisms. However, they support the notion of a limited flexible relationship between primary motor cortex and its target muscles following alterations of normal input-output patterns.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Clinical and hemodynamic aspects of low-flow infarcts.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "2318046", "authors": ["Weiller, C", "Ringelstein, EB", "Reiche, W", "Buell, U"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "When recording the onset of the electromyographic (EMG) voluntary response in reaction time (RT) studies, the electrodes should be placed on the muscle which is first and foremost involved in executing the response. It is thus necessary to identify which is the prime mover muscle among active synergic muscles. This has been investigated for index finger lift or flexion RTs by delivering a magnetic stimulus to motor cortical areas prior to the subject's voluntary response. The EMG responses to the magnetic stimulus were selectively facilitated either in the extensor indicis proprius muscle (in index lift RTs) or in the first dorsal interosseous muscle (in index flexion RTs). These effects are robust and provide a method for identifying the prime mover muscle in voluntary movements.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Central motor conduction studies in hereditary spastic paraplegia.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "2308676", "authors": ["Schady, W", "Dick, JP", "Sheard, A", "Crampton, S"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The 'excitability' and 'conductivity' of motor pathways during transcranial stimulation (TCS) have been investigated in 49 patients affected by multiple sclerosis (34), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (7), spino-cerebellar ataxia (3), primary lateral sclerosis (4) and brain metastasis (1). Hyper-reflexia, spasticity and weakness were correlated with the central motor conduction time (CCT) and with the threshold intensity of TCS required to produce a motor evoked potential (MEP). MEPs to magnetic TCS were recorded from hand and foot muscles during relaxation, contraction and after tendon vibration. Thresholds and CCTs of the patients were compared with those of 30 healthy controls. Increased threshold was found in 37 out of 49 patients (75.5%). Prolongation of the CCT was found in 38 out of 63 clinically affected upper limbs (60.3%) and in 56 out of 77 clinically affected lower limbs (72.7%). Absent motor responses to maximal TCS were found in 20 out of 98 lower limbs (20.4%). Excluding ALS patients (in whom there was a lower threshold for MEP elicitation), a significant linear correlation was found between prolonged CCT and increased threshold. While MEPs with prolonged CCTs have elevated TCS threshold, it is important to note that an elevated threshold was found in 14 out of 49 patients (28.5%) despite unchanged CCT. Spasticity and/or hyper-reflexia were more frequently associated with increased threshold than with prolonged CCT, while weakness was correlated equally well with both these parameters. In this respect magnetic TCS proves to represent a new tool for the detection of abnormal 'excitability' of the central motor tracts.", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "[Evoked potentials in diagnosis of ischemic brain stem lesions].", "issue": "8", "pmid": "7374773", "authors": ["Ferbert, A", "Buchner, H"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Der Nervenarzt", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Magnetic motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in masseter muscles.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "67287", "authors": ["Pavesi, G", "Macaluso, GM", "Tinchelli, S", "Medici, D", "Gemignani, F", "Mancia, D"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Transcranial facial nerve stimulation by magnetic stimulator in normal subjects.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "4136544", "authors": ["Rimpil\u00e4inen, I", "Eskola, H", "H\u00e4kkinen, V", "Karma, P"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Leg paresthesias induced by magnetic brain stimulation in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "2174077", "authors": ["Cohen, LG", "Topka, H", "Cole, RA", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Reorganization of corticospinal pathways following spinal cord injury.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "1376678", "authors": ["Topka, H", "Cohen, LG", "Cole, RA", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Prime mover muscle in finger lift or finger flexion reaction times: identification with transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1592028", "authors": ["Tomberg, C", "Caramia, MD"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "'Excitability changes of muscular responses to magnetic brain stimulation in patients with central motor disorders.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1580771", "authors": ["Caramia, MD", "Cicinelli, P", "Paradiso, C", "Mariorenzi, R", "Zarola, F", "Bernardi, G", "Rossini, PM"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "", "pages": "186-92"}]
