The potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), another promising method of noninvasive brain stimulation, to relieve tinnitus has not been explored systematically. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled and balanced order design, 20 patients suffering from chronic untreatable tinnitus were submitted to 20 minutes of 1 mA anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS targeting the left temporoparietal area. The primary outcome measure was a change in tinnitus intensity or discomfort assessed with a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) change-scale immediately after tDCS and 1 hour later. Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly reduced tinnitus intensity immediately after stimulation; whereas cathodal tDCS failed to do so. The variances of the tinnitus intensity and discomfort VAS change-scales increased dramatically after anodal and cathodal tDCS, whereas they remained virtually unchanged after sham tDCS. Moreover, several patients unexpectedly reported longer-lasting effects (at least several days) such as tinnitus improvement, worsening, or changes in tinnitus features, more frequently after real than sham tDCS. Anodal tDCS is a promising therapeutic tool for modulating tinnitus perception. Moreover, both anodal and cathodal tDCS seem able to alter tinnitus perception and could, thus, be used to trigger plastic changes.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Corticospinal state variability and hemispheric asymmetries in motivational tendencies.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "63862", "authors": ["Schutter, DJ", "Hofman, D", "Hoppenbrouwers, SS", "Kenemans, JL"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Biological psychology", "abstract": "Cross-sectional design.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation-guided resection of a left parietal tumor: case report.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "221551", "authors": ["Coburger, J", "Musahl, C", "Weissbach, C", "Bittl, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN", "abstract": "To investigate whether recurrent low back pain (LBP) is associated with changes in motor cortical representation of different paraspinal muscle fascicles.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "589", "title": "Effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the leg motor area on lumbar spinal network excitability in healthy subjects.", "issue": "Pt 11", "pmid": "7252877", "authors": ["Roche, N", "Lackmy, A", "Achache, V", "Bussel, B", "Katz, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Fascicles of the lumbar paraspinal muscles are differentially activated during function.

We tested this by using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and concurrent electromyography. This allowed us to interrogate the corticomotor excitability of specific response representations even before action ensued. We found that the motor evoked potential of the effector that might need to be stopped in the future was significantly reduced compared with when that effector was at rest. Further, this neural index of proactive and selective suppression predicted the subsequent selectivity with which the behavioral response was stopped. These results go further than earlier reports of reduced motor excitability when responses are stopped.

The effects of TMS and tDCS when applied over motor cortex should be considered with regard not only to cortical circuits but also to spinal motor circuits. The different modes of action and specificity of TMS and tDCS suggest that their effects on spinal network excitability may be different from that in the cortex. Until now, the effects of tDCS on lumbar spinal network excitability have never been studied. In this series of experiments, on healthy subjects, we studied the effects of anodal tDCS over the lower limb motor cortex on (i) reciprocal Ia inhibition projecting from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) to the soleus (SOL), (ii) presynaptic inhibition of SOL Ia terminals, (iii) homonymous SOL recurrent inhibition, and (iv) SOL H-reflex recruitment curves. The results show that anodal tDCS decreases reciprocal Ia inhibition, increases recurrent inhibition and induces no modification of presynaptic inhibition of SOL Ia terminals and of SOL-H reflex recruitment curves. Our results indicate therefore that the effects of tDCS are the opposite of those previously described for TMS on spinal network excitability. They also indicate that anodal tDCS induces effects on spinal network excitability similar to those observed during co-contraction suggesting that anodal tDCS activates descending corticospinal projections mainly involved in co-contractions.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "211", "title": "Corticospinal excitability is specifically modulated by the social dimension of observed actions.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "19474567", "authors": ["Sartori, L", "Cavallo, A", "Bucchioni, G", "Castiello, U"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Twelve healthy males participated in at least two experimental sessions designed to assess corticospinal and spinal excitabilities. We compared the modulation of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation and Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) during isometric and anisometric MVCs. The H-reflex and MEP responses, recorded during lengthening and shortening MVCs, were compared with those obtained during isometric MVCs. The results indicate that the maximal amplitude of both MEP and H-reflex in the SOL were smaller (P < 0.01) during lengthening MVCs compared with isometric and shortening MVCs but similar (P > 0.05) in MG for all three muscle contraction types. The silent period that follows maximal MEPs was reduced (P < 0.01) during lengthening MVCs in the SOL but not the MG. Similar observations were obtained regardless of the initial length of the MG muscle. Collectively, the current results indicate that the relative contribution of both cortical and spinal mechanisms to the modulation of neural activation differs during lengthening MVCs and between two synergist muscles.

While it was initially thought that the body schema developed with experience, the existence of phantom limbs in individuals born without a limb (amelics) led to the suggestion that it was innate. The problem with this idea, however, is that the vast majority of amelics do not report the presence of a phantom limb. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) of traumatic amputees can evoke movement sensations in the phantom, suggesting that traumatic amputation does not delete movement representations of the missing hand. Given this, we asked whether the absence of a phantom limb in the majority of amelics means that the motor cortex does not contain a cortical representation of the missing limb, or whether it is present but has been deactivated by the lack of sensorimotor experience. In four upper-limb amelic subjects we directly stimulated the arm/hand region of M1 to see 1) whether we could evoke phantom sensations, and 2) whether muscle representations in the two cortices were organised asymmetrically. TMS applied over the motor cortex contralateral to the missing limb evoked contractions in stump muscles but did not evoke phantom movement sensations. The location and extent of muscle maps varied between hemispheres but did not reveal any systematic asymmetries. In contrast, forearm muscle thresholds were always higher for the missing limb side. We suggest that phantom movement sensations reported by some upper limb amelics are mostly driven by vision and not by the persistence of motor commands to the missing limb within the sensorimotor cortex.

This equates to a 15% (95% CI 10% to 20%) reduction in pain which does not clearly exceed the pre-established criteria for a minimally clinically important difference (> 15%). For CES (four studies, 133 participants) no statistically significant difference was found between active stimulation and sham. Analysis of tDCS studies (five studies, 83 people) demonstrated significant heterogeneity and did not find a significant difference between active and sham stimulation.

We tested the hypotheses that 1) FEF contributes to performance in terms of visual target detection (possibly by modulation of activity in extrastriate areas with respect to the target), and 2) PPC is involved in translation of visual information for action. We used a task where the presence (and location) of the target was indicated by an eye movement. Task disruption was seen with FEF TMS (with reduced accuracy on the task) but not with PPC stimulation. When a search task requiring a manual response was presented, disruption with PPC TMS was seen. These results show dissociation of FEF and PPC contributions to visual search performance and that PPC involvement seems to be dependent on the response required by the task, whereas this is not the case for FEF.

We recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from right-hand muscles during the observation of an action sequence which, depending on context, might or might not elicit a complementary response.

In addition, effector and task specific inhibitory control mechanisms should be important to prevent overt motor activation during observation of speech-related lip movements or listening to speech. We tested these predictions by applying focal transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left M1 of 12 healthy right-handed volunteers and measuring motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in a lip muscle, the right orbicularis oris (OO), vs. a hand muscle, the right first dorsal interosseus (FDI). We found that MEP and SICI increased only in the OO but not in the FDI during viewing of speech-related lip movements or listening to speech. These changes were highly task specific because they were absent when lip movements non-related to speech were viewed. Finally, the increase in MEP amplitude in the OO correlated inversely with accuracy of speech perception, i.e. the MEP increase was directly related to task difficulty. The MEP findings support the notion that observation-execution matching is an operating process in the putative human MNS that might have been fundamental for evolution of language. Furthermore, the SICI findings provide evidence that inhibitory mechanisms are recruited to prevent unwanted overt motor activation during action observation.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Single session of transcranial direct current stimulation transiently increases knee extensor force in patients with hemiparetic stroke.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "19505799", "authors": ["Tanaka, S", "Takeda, K", "Otaka, Y", "Kita, K", "Osu, R", "Honda, M", "Sadato, N", "Hanakawa, T", "Watanabe, K"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "Speech production can be broadly separated into two distinct components: Phonation and Articulation.

After MSTIM with 25 Hz, MEP recruitment curves were increased at all post-stimulation assessments in both muscles. The most significant effect was achieved at T3 (1 h). Intracortical inhibition was decreased within the first hour, while intracortical facilitation was increased at all post-stimulation assessments. No significant effects were found following MSTIM with 10 Hz and following foot vibration. We conclude that 20 min MSTIM with a frequency of 25 Hz induces outlasting plastic changes in the primary motor cortex.

This magnetic field induces an electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The spatial distribution of the induced electric field is determined by the geometry and location of the coil relative to the brain. Although TMS has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is still unknown. To address this problem we developed a numerical scheme enabling us to combine realistic magnetic stimulation (MS) with compartmental modeling of neurons with arbitrary morphology. The induced electric field for each location in space was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the electromagnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. In both peripheral and central neurons, MS amplitude required for action potential generation was inversely proportional to the square of the diameter of the stimulated compartment. Due to the importance of the fiber's diameter, magnetic stimulation of CNS neurons depolarized the soma followed by initiation of an action potential in the initial segment of the axon. Passive dendrites affect this process primarily as current sinks, not sources. The simulations predict that neurons with low current threshold are more susceptible to magnetic stimulation. Moreover, they suggest that MS does not directly trigger dendritic regenerative mechanisms. These insights into the mechanism of MS may be relevant for the design of multi-intensity TMS protocols, may facilitate the construction of magnetic stimulators, and may aid the interpretation of results of TMS of the CNS.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Prolongation of central motor conduction time by neck extension in compressive cervical myelopathy.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "20043238", "authors": ["Heidegger, T", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study was designed to search potential changes in trigemino-facial system in blind subjects by the use of relatively well-established electrophysiological methods.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), given at 1-Hz (600 pulses), was used as a non-invasive way to interfere with processing in the cerebellar cortex. Performance was assessed for both 'physical' line bisection using a newly developed Landmark variant task and for 'mental' line bisection using number pairs. The effects for number line bisection were lateralized--left but not right cerebellar rTMS increased rightward errors, whereas for physical line bisection rTMS to either hemisphere did not affect performance. Effects due to neck muscle contraction and changes in eye position were ruled out with appropriate control stimulation sites, and eye-tracking. The results confirm the role of the cerebellum in spatial judgement, and, for the first time, demonstrate direct cerebellar involvement in the generation of the midline in 'imaginal' (number) space.

This suggests that the left hemisphere is specialized for movement control of either hand, although previous experiments tested mostly right-handed participants. In contrast, research on hemispheric asymmetries of ipsilateral M1 involvement in left-handed participants is relatively scarce. In the present study, left- and right-handed participants performed complex unimanual movements, whereas TMS was used to disrupt the activity of ipsilateral M1 in accordance with a \"virtual lesion\" approach. For right-handed participants, more disruptions were induced when TMS was applied over the dominant (left) M1. For left-handed participants, two subgroups could be distinguished, such that one group showed more disruptions when TMS was applied over the nondominant (left) M1, whereas the other subgroup showed more disruptions when the dominant (right) M1 was stimulated. This indicates that functional asymmetries of M1 involvement during ipsilateral movements are influenced by both hand dominance as well as left hemisphere specialization.

This may involve altered responsiveness or changes in awareness of self and subjective experiences. Subcortical arousal systems and paralimbic fronto-parietal association cortices are thought to underpin current concepts of consciousness. The Network Inhibition Hypothesis proposes a common neuroanatomical substrate for impaired consciousness during absence, complex partial and tonic-clonic seizures. Neurostimulation in epilepsy remains in its infancy with vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) as the only firmly established technique and a series of other methods under investigation including deep brain stimulation (DBS), intracranial cortical stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Many of these systems impact on the neural systems thought to be involved in consciousness as a continuous duty cycle although some adaptive (seizure triggered) techniques have been developed. Theoretically, fixed duty cycle neurostimulation could have profound effects on responsiveness, awareness of self and subjective experience. Animal studies suggest vagal nerve stimulation positively influences hippocampal long term potentiation. In humans, a chronic effect of increased alertness in VNS implanted subjects and acute effect on memory consolidation have been reported but convincing data on either improvements or deterioration in attention and memory is lacking. Thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is perhaps the most interesting neurostimulation technique in the context of consciousness. Neither bilateral anterior or centromedian thalamic nucleus DBS seem to affect cognition. Unilateral globus pallidus internus DBS caused transient wakefulness in an anaesthetised individual. As intracranial neurostimulation, particularly thalamic DBS, becomes more established as a clinical intervention, the effects on consciousness and cognition with variations in stimulus parameters will need to be studied to understand whether these secondary effects of neurostimulation make a significant positive (or adverse) contribution to quality of life.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Combined transcranial direct current stimulation and robot-assisted gait training in patients with chronic stroke: a preliminary comparison.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16380608", "authors": ["Geroin, C", "Picelli, A", "Munari, D", "Waldner, A", "Tomelleri, C", "Smania, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical rehabilitation", "abstract": "Aphasia researchers and clinicians share some basic beliefs about language recovery post stroke.

TMS was performed 3 months after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 11 patients with subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS; defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale \u226510), 12 patients with objective EDS (as defined by mean sleep latency <5 on multiple sleep latency tests), 11 patients with fatigue (defined by daytime tiredness without signs of subjective or objective EDS), 10 patients with post-traumatic hypersomnia \"sensu strictu,\" and 14 control subjects. Measures of cortical excitability included central motor conduction time, resting motor threshold (RMT), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation to paired-TMS. RMT was higher and SICI was more pronounced in the patients with objective EDS than in the control subjects. In the other patients all TMS parameters did not differ significantly from the controls. Similarly to that reported in patients with narcolepsy, the cortical hypoexcitability may reflect the deficiency of the excitatory hypocretin/orexin-neurotransmitter system.

This resulted in diminished top-down modulation of activity in posterior cortex during early encoding stages, which predicted a subsequent decrement in working memory accuracy. Participants with stronger fronto-posterior functional connectivity displayed greater disruptive effects.

For many patients, resective surgery can be an alternative for achieving seizure freedom; however, its success depend on identifying seizure foci before surgery. Many patients with medically intractable epilepsy are not suitable candidates for surgery. The therapeutic effect of electrical stimulation on the brain has been studied for decades. Currently, the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, cerebellar nuclei, and cortical seizure foci are stimulated for treating epilepsy. In 2010, the results of the first, multicenter randomized double-blinded controlled study were published. This report documents a clinical trial involving stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for epilepsy (SANTE). These results showed bilateral stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus reduces seizures.

Interictal epileptiform discharges, on the other hand, are not specific enough for SOZ as they are recorded at zones other than the SOZ; they are also recorded from areas that do not generate the ictal pattern and from areas to which ictal discharges propagate. Besides spikes and sharp waves, a novel index of human epileptogenicity has been investigated in association with wide-band electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. We primarily noted the following during clinical neurophysiological analysis for clinical epilepsy. (1) Recent development of digital EEG technology enabled us to record wide-band EEG in a clinical setting. Thus, high frequency (>200 Hz) and low frequency (<1 Hz) components can be reliably recorded using subdural electrodes. Direct current shift, slow shift, ripple, and fast ripple can be well delineated, and they will be potentially useful in the diagnosis and management of epileptic patients. (2) Fiber tractography (morphological parameter) and cortico-cortical-evoked potentials with single cortical stimulation (electrophysiological parameter) elucidated cortico-cortical connections in human brain. The data thus obtained can help us understand the mechanism of seizure propagation and normal cortical functional connectivity. (3) Non-invasive simultaneous recording of EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided information on the roles of deep brain structures associated with scalp-recorded epileptiform discharges. Interventional neurophysiology can shed light on the non-pharmacological treatment of epilepsy.

Healthy, right-handed participant groups were comprised of 12 sedentary older adults, 12 physically active older adults, and 12 young adults.

Furthermore, analysis of the functional brain networks constructed using a connectivity matrix between scalp electrodes revealed a significant decrease in the global efficiency index for the higher-beta frequency range (22-29 Hz), indicating that the brain network changes its topology with practice of hand grasping MI.
