Seven healthy right-handed adults with no known neuromuscular disabilities performed an isometric voluntary wrist flexion at submaximum continuous exertion. After the subjects continued muscle contraction until volitional fatigue, the H-reflexes induced by an electric stimulation and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) from a flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle were recorded 7 times every 20 s. The H-reflex was used to assess excitability changes at the spinal level, and the MEP was used to study excitability changes at the cortical level. Hreflexes showed a depression (30% of control value) soon after the cessation of wrist flexion and recovered with time thereafter. On the other hand, an early (short latency) MEP showed facilitation immediately after the cessation of wrist flexion (50% of control value) and thereafter decreased. A possible mechanism for the contradictory results of the 2 tests, in spite of focusing on the same motoneuron pool, might be the different test potential sizes between them. In addition, a late (long latency) MEP response appeared with increasing exercise. With regard to the occurrence of late MEP response, a central mechanism may be proposed to explain the origin-that is, neural pathways with a high threshold that do not participate under normal circumstances might respond to an emergency level of muscle exercise, probably reflecting central effects of fatigue.", "pages": "82-99"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Is it time to introduce repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation into standard clinical practice for the treatment of depressive disorders?", "issue": "1", "pmid": "12534650", "authors": ["Fitzgerald, P"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry", "abstract": "To examine issues relating to the potential introduction of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) into clinical practice as a treatment for depression.", "pages": "82-99"}, {"volume": "102", "title": "Motor and phosphene thresholds to transcranial magnetic stimuli: a reproducibility study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "12534244", "authors": ["Fumal, A", "Bohotin, V", "Vandenheede, M", "Seidel, L", "Maertens de Noordhout, A", "Schoenen, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Acta neurologica Belgica", "abstract": "A review of the outcomes literature accompanied by an analysis of issues relating to the potential advantages and pitfalls of the introduction of rTMS as a treatment strategy.", "pages": "82-99"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Two cases of quadriparesis following anterior cervical discectomy, with normal perioperative somatosensory evoked potentials.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12531970", "authors": ["Jones, SJ", "Buonamassa, S", "Crockard, HA"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Evidence is progressively accumulating that rTMS has antidepressant properties that are clinically relevant.

TMS was applied unexpectedly at different phases of the movement cycle.

The trial-to-trial variability of MEPs was greater in the older subjects, particularly at intensities near threshold.

Overall, MEP variability fell markedly as stimulus intensity increased above threshold but less rapidly in older than in younger subjects. Females tended to have larger MEP variability than males, but age and threshold were much stronger modulators than sex.

There were no significant changes in FDI MEPs following the control paradigm, and dual stimulation induced an increase in the FDI MEPs only inconsistently. In contrast, the painful stimulation and the combined pain and dual stimulation paradigms were followed by significant suppression of the FDI MEPs at higher stimulus intensities. No changes were observed in the FCU MEPs following the four paradigms. In two additional subjects, the responses evoked in FDI by direct stimulation of the descending corticospinal tracts were significantly depressed following painful stimulation of the FDI, although the ulnar-evoked M-waves remained constant. It is concluded that muscle pain is followed by a period with profound depression of MEPs amplitudes in the resting muscle, but that these changes are at least in part due to a lasting depression of the excitability of the motoneurones in the spinal cord.

Without rTMS we found a negative BBR in the left but no significant BBR in the right MFG. This negative BBR is best explained by an increased effort of volunteers with an inferior task performance. Left-sided rTMS led to a shift of the BBR towards the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and to a positive BBR in anterior parts of the left SFG. With rTMS of the right MFG the BBR was posterior and inferior in the left inferior frontal gyrus.

Soleus H reflexes and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were modulated similarly during the crank cycle being large during downstroke [concomitant with soleus background electromyographic (EMG) activity] and small during upstroke. Tibialis anterior MEPs were in contrast large during upstroke and small during downstroke. The soleus H reflexes and MEPs were also recorded during tonic plantarflexion at a similar ankle joint position, corresponding ankle angle, and matched background EMG activity as during the different phases of bicycling. Relative to their size during tonic plantarflexion, the MEPs were found to be facilitated in the early part of downstroke during bicycling, whereas the H reflexes were depressed in the late part of downstroke. The intensity of TMS was decreased below MEP threshold and used to condition the soleus H reflex. At short intervals (conditioning-test intervals of -3 to -1 ms), TMS produced a facilitation of the H reflex that is in all likelihood caused by activation of the fast monosynaptic corticospinal pathway. This facilitation was significantly larger in the early part of downstroke during bicycling than during tonic plantarflexion. This suggests that the increased MEP during downstroke was caused by changes in transmission in the fast monosynaptic corticospinal pathway. To investigate whether the depression of H reflexes in the late part of downstroke was caused by increased presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents, the soleus H reflex was conditioned by stimulation of the femoral nerve. At a short interval (conditioning-test interval: -7 to -5 ms), the femoral nerve stimulation produced a facilitation of the H reflex that is mediated by the heteronymous monosynaptic Ia pathway from the femoral nerve to soleus motoneurons. Within the initial 0.5 ms after its onset, the size of this facilitation depends on the level of presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferents, which mediate the facilitation. The size of the facilitation was strongly depressed in the late part of downstroke, compared with the early part of downstroke, suggesting that increased presynaptic inhibition was indeed responsible for the depression of the H reflex. These findings suggest that there is a selectively increased transmission in the fast monosynaptic corticospinal pathway to soleus motoneurons in early downstroke during bicycling. It would seem likely that one cause of this is increased excitability of the involved cortical neurons. The increased presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents in late downstroke may be of importance for depression of stretch reflex activity before and during upstroke.", "pages": "82-99"}, {"volume": "140", "title": "Cortical frames of reference for eye-hand coordination.", "issue": "", "pmid": "2489409", "authors": ["Van Donkelaar, P", "Lee, JH", "Drew, AS"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "We studied remote effects of teeth clenching on motor cortical and spinal cord excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), brainstem electrical stimulation (BES), and ulnar nerve stimulation (F-wave) in eight normal volunteers.

Surface electromyographic responses were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Responses at different intervals were compared with the response elicited when the subject made no teeth clenching (control response). In TMS, conditioned responses (during teeth clenching) were significantly larger than the control at all intervals. In contrast, in BES and F-waves, conditioned responses were not larger than the control at an early phase (intervals shorter than 50 ms), whereas they were larger than the control at later intervals (longer than 50 ms). These results suggest that facilitation occurs in the hand motor area at the early phase of teeth clenching, and spinal facilitation dominates at its late phase. This time course of facilitation may indicate that the motor cortex must regulate hand muscles finely at the early phase of teeth clenching, and spinal cord may stabilize them firmly at the late phase.

When stimulation was triggered by self-paced movements, the silent period of the homologous muscle was significantly shortened, but the F-wave and compound muscle action potential were unchanged. Our findings demonstrate that voluntary hand movement exerts an inhibitory influence on a diffuse area of the ipsilateral motor cortex. This inhibitory influence is both time and movement dependent.

Recent studies demonstrate that the primary motor cortex is affected by neuronal degeneration accompanied by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It is conceivable that neuronal loss is compensated by reorganization of the neural circuitries occurring along the natural course of the disease, thereby maintaining motor performances in daily living. Cortical motor output to upper limbs was tested via motor-evoked potentials from forearm and hand muscles elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex in 16 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease without motor deficits. Motor cortex excitability was increased, and the center of gravity of motor cortical output, as represented by excitable scalp sites, showed a frontal and medial shift, without correlated changes in the site of maximal excitability (hot-spot). This may indicate functional reorganization, possibly after the neuronal loss in motor areas. Hyperexcitability might be caused by a dysregulation of the intracortical GABAergic inhibitory circuitries and selective alteration of glutamatergic neurotransmission.

It encompasses two widely used waveform configurations: mono-phasic magnetic pulses induce a single current in the brain while biphasic pulses induce at least two currents of inverse direction. As has been shown for the motor cortex, efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may depend on pulse configuration. In order to clarify this question with regard to visual perception, static contrast sensitivities (sCS) were evaluated before, during, immediately after and 10 minutes after monophasic and biphasic low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS applied to the occipital cortex of 15 healthy subjects.

Using 4 c/d spatial frequency, significant sCS loss was found during and immediately after 10 min of monophasic stimulation, while biphasic stimulation resulted in no significant effect. Ten minutes after the end of stimulation, the sCS values were at baseline level again. However, reversed current flow direction resulted in an increased efficacy of biphasic and decreased efficacy of monophasic stimulation.

Each subject completed two exercise protocols on a rowing ergometer: a light exercise protocol at a sub-maximal output for 10 min and an intense exercise protocol at maximum output for 1 min. A trial of ten magnetic stimuli was delivered before each of the protocols and, on finishing exercise, further trials of ten stimuli were delivered every 2 min for a 16 min period. Amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in each of the three test muscles were measured before exercise and during the recovery period after exercise. The non-rowers showed a brief facilitation of MEPs in ES 2 min after light and intense exercise that was only present in the elite rowers after intense exercise. In the period 4-16 min after light exercise, the mean (+/- S.E.M.) MEP amplitude (relative to pre-exercise levels) was less depressed in the elite rowers (79.4 +/- 2.1%) than in the non-rowers (60.9 +/- 2.5%) in the left ES but not significantly so in the right ES. MEP amplitudes in FDI were significantly larger in the elite rowers, averaging 119.0 +/- 3.1% pre-exercise levels, compared with 101.2 +/- 5.8% in the non-rowers. Pre-exercise MEP latencies were no different in the two groups.

There were no differences in MEP depression or latency between elite rowers and non-rowers after intense exercise. We conclude that the smaller degree of MEP depression in the elite rowers after light exercise reflects less central fatigue within corticospinal control pathways than that seen in the non-rowers. The longer latency of MEPs seen in the elite rowers may reflect recruitment of more slower-conducting fatigue-resistant motor units compared with the non-rowers. These differences may be because the energy requirements for the non-rowers during light exercise are closer to their maximum capacity, leading to more fatigue.

Biomedical engineering", "abstract": "In the last decade, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used increasingly as a tool to explore the mechanisms and consequences of cortical plasticity in the intact human cortex. Because the spatial accuracy of the technique is limited, we refer to this as plasticity at a regional level. Currently, TMS is used to explore regional reorganization in three different ways. First, it can map changes in the pattern of connectivity within and between different cortical areas or their spinal projections. Important examples of this approach can be found in the work on motor cortex representations following a variety of interventions such as immobilization, skill acquisition, or stroke. Second, TMS can be used to investigate the behavioural relevance of these changes. By applying TMS in its \"virtual lesion\" mode, it is possible to interfere with cortical function and ask whether plastic reorganization within a distinct cortical area improves function. Third, TMS can be used to promote changes in cortical function. This is achieved by using repetitive TMS (rTMS) to induce short-term functional reorganization in the human cortex. The magnitude and the direction of rTMS-induced plasticity depend on extrinsic factors (i.e. the variables of stimulation such as intensity, frequency, and total number of stimuli) and intrinsic factors (i.e. the functional state of the cortex targeted by rTMS). Since conditioning effects of rTMS are not limited to the stimulated cortex but give rise to functional changes in interconnected cortical areas, rTMS is a suitable tool to investigate plasticity within a distributed functional network. Indeed, the lasting effects of rTMS offer new possibilities to study dynamic aspects of the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases and may have therapeutic potential in some neuropsychiatric disorders.", "pages": "82-99"}, {"volume": "252", "title": "Increased transcranial magnetic motor threshold after ECT.

Because magnetic fields pass through tissue unimpeded, there is greater control over the site and extent of stimulation with MST than can be achieved with ECT. This enhanced control represents a means of focusing the treatment on target cortical structures thought to be essential to antidepressant response and of reducing spread to medial temporal regions implicated in the cognitive side effects of ECT. MST is currently at an early stage of development. This article reviews the experience with MST in animal models and initial human investigations. Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility of performing MST in the clinical setting, and there are suggestions that MST may have advantages over ECT in terms of subjective side effects and some measures of acute cognitive functioning. The antidepressant efficacy of MST is not yet known, but studies designed to address that critical issue are underway.

Magnetic stimulation can be used for stimulating peripheral nerves with a similar mechanism of activation as for electrical stimulation. When TMS is applied to the cerebral cortex, however, some features emerge that distinguish it from transcranial electrical stimulation. One of the most important features is designated the D and I wave hypothesis, which is now widely accepted as a mechanism of TMS of the motor cortex. Transcranial electrical stimulation excites the pyramidal tract axons directly, either at the initial segment of the neuron or at proximal internodes in the subcortical white matter, giving rise to D (direct) waves, whereas TMS excites the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically, giving rise to I (indirect) waves. There are still other phenomena with mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. First, not only excitatory effects but also inhibitory effects can be elicited by TMS of the cerebral cortex (e.g., the silent period and intracortical inhibition). The inhibitory effect may also be used to investigate cerebral functions other than the motor cortex, such as the visual, sensory cortices, and the frontal eye field, from which no overt response like the motor evoked potential can be elicited. Second, there is an abundance of intraregional functional connectivities among different cortical areas that can also be revealed by TMS, or TMS in combination with neuroimaging techniques. Last, repetitive transcranial stimulation exerts a lasting effect on brain function even after the stimulation has ceased.

When recording the motor evoked potential (MEP) from the resting abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle, using a fixed ISI of 1.5 ms, and expressing the interaction between S1 and S2 as MEP(S1+S2)/(MEP(S1) + MEP(S2)), then a systematic variation of the intensities of S1 and S2 revealed short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) if S1 and S2 were approximately equal to MEP threshold (RMT), or if S1 > RMT and S2 < RMT. In contrast, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) occurred if S1 < RMT and S2 > RMT. Contraction of the ADM left SICI unchanged but reduced SICF. The GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam increased SICI and reduced SICF in the resting ADM while diazepam had no effect during ADM contraction. Surface EMG and single motor unit recordings revealed that during ADM contraction SICI onset was at the I3-wave latency of S2, whereas SICF typically \"jumped up\" by one I-wave and started with the I2-wave latency of S2. Findings suggest that SICI is mediated through a low-threshold GABA(A) receptor-dependent inhibitory pathway and summation of IPSP from S1 and EPSP from S2 at the corticospinal neurone.

The digital stimulation was set at three times the sensory threshold and preceded TMS or TES at intervals ranging from 10 to 100 ms. In normal subjects, a somatotopic inhibitory effect was detected, since the CF stimulation was significantly more powerful in determining the reduction of MEPs in response to TMS at intervals ranging from 20 to 50 ms. In dystonic patients, on the contrary, the somatopic effect was not present, because both CF and NCF stimulation evoked a consistent MEP inhibition and no significant difference was detected between the conditioning effect of CF and NCF stimulation. These abnormalities were present in the muscles of both the affected and unaffected hands of HD patients, as well as in CD patients. TES conditioning provoked MEP inhibition only at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) <40 ms. Significant MEP potentiation was found at ISIs of 20-40 ms to CF stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, while there was no effect after NCF stimulation. These data suggest that MEP suppression in response to digital stimulation is preserved in dystonia, but the somatotopically distributed input-output organization of the sensorimotor interactions is lost in dystonic patients' hands.
