Recently, we have shown that the degree of post-exercise corticomotor depression (PED) and increase in short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) after a repetitive finger movement task was less when the task was performed at a maximal voluntary rate (MVR) than when it was performed at a submaximal sustainable rate (SR). In the current study, we have compared the time course of PED and SICI in the dominant (DOM) and nondominant (NDOM) hands after an MVR and SR finger movement task to determine the influence of hand dominance and task demand. We tracked motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the DOM and NDOM hand for 20 min after a 10-s index finger flexion-extension task at MVR and SR. For all hand-task combinations, we report a period of PED and increased SICI lasting for up to 8 min. We find that the least demanding task, one that involved index finger movement of the DOM hand at SR, was associated with the greatest change in PED and SICI from baseline (63.6\u00b15.7% and 79\u00b12%, P<0.001, PED and SICI, respectively), whereas the most demanding task (MVR of the NDOM hand) was associated with the least change from baseline (PED: 88.1\u00b13.6%, SICI: 103\u00b12%; P<0.001). Our findings indicate that the changes in CME and inhibition associated with repetitive finger movement are influenced both by handedness and the degree of demand of the motor task and are inversely related to task demand, being smallest for an MVR task of the NDOM hand and greatest for an SR task of the DOM hand. The findings provide additional evidence for differences in neuronal processing between the dominant and nondominant hemispheres in motor control.", "pages": "110-7"}, {"volume": "231", "title": "Prior action execution has no effect on corticospinal facilitation during action observation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "22449863", "authors": ["Loporto, M", "McAllister, CJ", "Edwards, MG", "Wright, DJ", "Holmes, PS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used widely in research investigating corticospinal (CS) excitability during action observation.

Here, we report a single-pulse TMS study that investigated whether CS excitability during action observation was modulated by actions performed by the observers prior to viewing a ball pinching action. The results showed that CS excitability during action observation increased when compared to observation of a static hand, but that there was no additional motor facilitation when participants performed the same action prior to observing it.

Many of these simple hallucinations fall into a small number of perceptual geometries-the Kl\u00fcver forms-that (via a nonlinear mapping from retina to cortex) correspond to even simpler sets of oriented stripes of cortical activity (and their superpositions). Other simple hallucinations (phosphenes and fortification auras) are linked to the Kl\u00fcver forms and to pattern-forming cortical mechanisms by their spatial and temporal scales. The Kl\u00fcver cortical activity patterns are examples of self-organized pattern formation that arise from nonlinear dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons; with reasonable modifications, this model accounts for a wide range of hallucinated patterns. The Kl\u00fcver cortical activity patterns are a subset of autonomous spatiotemporal cortical patterns, some of which have been studied with functional imaging techniques. Understanding the interaction of these intrinsic patterns with stimulus-driven cortical activity is an important problem in neuroscience. In line with this, hallucinatory pattern formation interacts with physical stimuli, and many conditions that induce hallucinations show interesting interactions with one another. Both types of interactions are predictable from neural and psychophysical principles such as localized processing, excitatory-inhibitory neural circuits, lateral inhibition, simultaneous and sequential contrast, saccadic suppression, and perceptual opponency.

A focal, noninvasive form of brain stimulation called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to produce acute and chronic analgesic effects when applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), but the anatomical and pharmacological mechanisms by which prefrontal rTMS induces analgesia remain unclear. Data suggest that DLPFC mediates top-down analgesia via gain modulation of the supraspinal opioidergic circuit. This potential pathway might explain how prefrontal rTMS reduces pain. The purpose of this sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was to determine whether left DLPFC rTMS-induced analgesia was sensitive to \u03bc-opioid blockade. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive real or sham TMS after either intravenous saline or naloxone pretreatment. Acute hot and cold pain via quantitative sensory testing and hot allodynia via block testing on capsaicin-treated skin were assessed at baseline and at 0, 20, and 40 minutes after TMS treatment. When compared to sham, real rTMS reduced hot pain and hot allodynia. Naloxone pretreatment significantly reduced the analgesic effects of real rTMS. These results demonstrate that left DLPFC rTMS-induced analgesia requires opioid activity and suggest that rTMS drives endogenous opioidergic pain relief in the human brain.

We aimed to explore the neurophysiological foundation of these effects by exploring nonfocal and focal plasticity-inducing protocols in human smokers under nicotine withdrawal and exposition. Focal, synapse-specific plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), while nonfocal plasticity was induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Each subject (12) received placebo and nicotine patches combined with one of the stimulation protocols to the primary motor cortex. Corticospinal excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potential amplitudes.

In contrast, excitability-diminishing plasticity was not affected by nicotine withdrawal. Under nicotine, the inhibitory aftereffects of PAS were delayed and prolonged, while the tDCS-generated excitability reduction was abolished. Thus, absent facilitatory plasticity in smokers during nicotine withdrawal is restituted by nicotine, favoring the deficit-compensating hypothesis of nicotine consumption.

In the present study, corticospinal excitability and peripheral contractility of ankle flexor muscles were quantified before, during and after repeated brief unilateral maximal dorsiflexions to fatigue in eleven healthy volunteers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex area related to lower limb muscles was performed, and the evoked twitch and EMG responses in tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) were measured. The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in fatigued TA during post-exercise maximal dorsiflexions were smaller (-20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and remained depressed for at least 5\u00a0min.

In HV, PAS and motor learning induced long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity of excitatory networks and a lasting decrease of LAI and LICI in the motor representation of the targeted or trained muscle.

In contrast, LICI was normally modulated. In patients the results after PAS did not match those obtained after motor learning: LAI was paradoxically increased and LICI did not exhibit any change. In the normal situation, decreased excitability in inhibitory circuits after induction of LTP-like plasticity may help to shape the cortical maps according to the new sensorimotor task.

Brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, use electromagnetic principles to alter brain activity noninvasively, and induce focal but also network effects beyond the stimulation site. When combined with brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and electroencephalography, these brain stimulation techniques enable a causal assessment of the interaction between different network components, and their respective functional roles. The same techniques can also be applied to explore hypotheses regarding the changes in functional connectivity that occur during task performance and in various disease states such as stroke, depression and schizophrenia.

For this purpose, time to task failure was measured during position- and force-controlled muscular contractions. Subjects received either visual feedback about the force produced by pressing a force transducer or about the actual position between thumb and index finger. Participants were instructed to either match the force level of 30% MVC or the finger position corresponding to the thumb and index finger angle at this contraction intensity. Subjects demonstrated a shorter time to task failure when they were provided with feedback about their joint position (11.5 \u00b1 6.2 min) instead of force feedback (19.2 \u00b1 12.8 min; P = 0.01). To test differences in motor cortical activity between position- and force-controlled contractions, subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (subTMS) was applied while executing submaximal (20% MVC) contractions. SubTMS resulted in a suppression of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) EMG in both tasks. However, the mean suppression for the position-controlled task was significantly greater (18.6 \u00b1 9.4% vs. 13.3 \u00b1 7.5%; P = 0.025) and lasted longer (13.9 \u00b1 7.5 ms vs. 9.3 \u00b1 4.3 ms; P = 0.024) compared to the force-controlled task.

Using a perturb-and-measure transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) approach, we show that off-line TMS disruption of regions within (inferior frontal cortex, IFC) and upstream (superior temporal sulcus, STS) the parietofrontal AON transiently abolishes and enhances the motor facilitation to observed implied actions, respectively. Our findings highlight the critical role of IFC in anticipatory motor simulation. More importantly, they show that disruption of STS calls into play compensatory motor simulation activity, fundamental for counteracting the noisy visual processing induced by TMS.

Here, by using offline TMS, we investigated the role of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), thought to be involved in both attentional and binding processes, in the generation of the ABE.

Indeed, if the effect of parietal stimulation was merely to disrupt attention, we would expect an increase (not a decrease) of bouncing percepts.

Other examples are the musical savants with perfect pitch and the hyperlexics, who (in one case) can read a page in 8 seconds and recall the text later at a 99% level. Other types of talents and artistic skills can be found, involving 3-D drawing, map memory, poetry, painting, sculpturing, including one savant who could recite without error the value of Pi to 22,514 places. The acquired form refers to the development of outstanding skills after some brain injury or disease, usually involving the left fronto-temporal area. This type of injury seems to inhibit the 'tyranny of the left hemisphere', allowing the right hemisphere to develop the savant skills. One other way to inhibit the left fronto-temporal area is to use transcranial magnetic stimulation in normal subjects and nearly one-half of these subjects can then perform new skills during the stimulation that they could not perform before. This type of finding indicates the potentiality in all of us for the development of savant skills under special circumstances.

Future studies should prospectively replicate these findings and also further investigate appropriate treatments for the sub-groups of non-responders identified in this study, given that most of these biomarkers have also been found in antidepressant medication studies.", "pages": "110-7"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "[Neuronal adaptation of corticospinal mechanisms of muscle contraction regulation in athletes].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "20232062", "authors": ["Fomin, RN", "Seliaev, MV"], "year": "", "journal": "Fiziologiia cheloveka", "abstract": "When using transcranial magnetic stimulation, a stimulation intensity defined as a certain level above the threshold for activation of a hand muscle is commonly used, disregarding the fact that the\u00a0areas of activation for different muscles may have varying response characteristics intra- and interindividually.", "pages": "110-7"}, {"volume": "1446", "title": "Electromyographic bursting following the cortical silent period induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22443438", "authors": ["Chin, O", "Cash, RF", "Thickbroom, GW"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "To study the response characteristics of different muscles and compare them within and between individuals.
