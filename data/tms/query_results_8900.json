Two coil positions were used: the coil held on a parasagittal line either with the induced current in the brain flowing in a postero-anterior direction (PA) or with the current flowing latero-medially (LM). The results were compared with those observed after anodal electrical stimulation. LM stimulation produced surface and single unit responses which occurred 0-3 msec earlier than PA stimulation. In many cases responses to LM stimulation had the same latency as those produced by anodal electrical stimulation. Responses evoked by LM stimulation were less affected by changes in motor cortical excitability (cortico-cortical inhibition and transcallosal inhibition) than those to PA stimulation. We suggest that LM stimulation can sometimes stimulate corticospinal fibres directly, at or near the same site as anodal stimulation. In contrast, PA stimulation tends to activate corticospinal fibres trans-synaptically. The difference in stimulation sites may make a comparison of PA and LM stimulation a useful method of localising changes in corticospinal excitability to a cortical level.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Reliability of transcranial magnetic stimulation for mapping the human motor cortex.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7512919", "authors": ["Mortifee, P", "Stewart, H", "Schulzer, M", "Eisen, A"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Motor mapping using transcranial magnetic stimulation has been applied to the study of adaptive and restorative mechanisms of the motor cortex.

With cortical stimulation during voluntary activation of the tongue muscles it proved easy to obtain responses with the characteristics of centrally evoked responses allowing reliable measurements of latencies and amplitudes. By contrast, responses from magnetic stimulation of the intracranial segment of the hypoglossal nerve were more difficult to obtain and the reproducibility was often not satisfactory.

In order to ascertain the role of the cerebellum in determining the modulation of the motor cortex excitability we examined, in 10 normal subjects and in 2 patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, the effects of electrical stimuli over the base of the skull on the motor responses evoked by cortical magnetic stimulation. In both patients no inhibition of motor responses was present in the muscles ipsilateral to the lesion, whereas an inhibition, similar to that observed in controls, was evident on the opposite side. The present findings suggest the cerebellar origin of the motor effects seen after electrical stimulation of the base of the skull and further clarify the physiological cerebro-cerebellar interactions in man.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Transcranial motor evoked potentials.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8023082", "authors": ["Chiappa, KH"], "year": "", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "1. The threshold for obtaining EMG responses after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain is reduced by voluntary contraction of the target muscle. The present experiments tested whether some of this effect is due to increased cortical, as opposed to spinal, excitability during the contraction. 2. Magnetic stimulation was delivered with a figure-of-eight coil oriented with the junction region along the interaural line and also (in 4 of 7 subjects) with a circular coil centred at the vertex. The intensity of the conditioning stimulus was subthreshold for evoking a motor response in the relaxed wrist flexor muscles of the forearm. The presence of a small descending corticospinal volley in both the relaxed and active conditions was detected by measuring the facilitation of test H reflexes elicited in the flexor muscles of the forearm. 3. In all subjects, magnetic stimulation with either coil facilitated the H reflex at conditioning-test intervals of -1 to -3 ms (median nerve stimulus before magnetic). This was followed by a long-lasting facilitation. In three of the seven subjects stimulation with the figure-of-eight coil elicited an additional, earlier peak of facilitation at a conditioning-test interval of -3 to -5 ms. 4. In all subjects, the threshold for obtaining facilitation of the H reflex using a conditioning-test interval of -1 to -3 ms was reduced, and the amount of facilitation was larger, if subjects performed a weak tonic voluntary contraction. In contrast, with a conditioning-test interval of -3 to -5 ms voluntary contraction had no effect on the threshold. 5. It is suggested that H reflex facilitation at the conditioning-test interval of -1 to -3 ms was produced by indirect activation of corticospinal neurones by the magnetic stimulus, whereas at -3 to -5 ms, the facilitation was produced by direct activation of corticospinal axons. It is concluded that tonic voluntary contraction of a target muscle decreases the threshold for indirect activation of corticospinal neurones but not for direct stimulation of their axons.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Idiopathic generalized epilepsy: magnetic stimulation of motor cortex time-locked and unlocked to 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8012811", "authors": ["Gianelli, M", "Cantello, R", "Civardi, C", "Naldi, P", "Bettucci, D", "Schiavella, MP", "Mutani, R"], "year": "", "journal": "Epilepsia", "abstract": "We investigated excitability changes of the motor cortex associated with the E2 phase of cutaneous reflexes in the first dorsal interosseous muscle using transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in humans.

A long, straight, uniform fiber is polarized by an activating function, proportional to the axial gradient of the axial electric field. During unipolar anodal stimulation, the activating function results in two areas of depolarization (virtual cathodes) that are responsible for anode-make stimulation. During unipolar cathodal stimulation, the virtual anodes can be exploited to produce unidirectional propagation and physiological recruitment of axons. Anode-break stimulation of nerves arises from the intrinsic properties of the sodium channel kinetics; cathode-break stimulation in nerves is anode-break stimulation at a virtual anode. The activating function applies to magnetic stimulation as well as to electric stimulation. Other important mechanisms of stimulation arise if the fiber is terminated, nonuniform, or curved. In the brain, cortical neurons are excited when the electric field is directed from the dendrites toward the axon. Possible mechanisms for cortical excitation are the impedance mismatch between the axon and dendritic tree, and the axon bending as it enters the white matter. Transcranial magnetic stimulation differs from transcranial electric stimulation because during magnetic stimulation the electric field is parallel to the brain surface, whereas during electric stimulation the electric field has components both parallel and perpendicular to the brain surface. Cardiac tissue can be represented by use of the bidomain model. This model predicts that a point-source stimulus results in adjacent areas of depolarized and hyperpolarized tissue. The presence of virtual anodes during cathodal stimulation is analogous to the creation of virtual anodes along a one-dimensional fiber by the activating function. Anode- and cathode-break stimulation both occur in cardiac tissue, but the mechanism may be different than for nerve and may depend on diffusion of depolarization into a previously hyperpolarized region. Electrical stimulation of cardiac tissue can cause reentry through a critical point mechanism. Two mechanisms for defibrillation have been hypothesized: (1) the relatively high junctional resistance between cardiac cells causes each cell to be depolarized on one side and hyperpolarized on the other; and (2) the fiber tracts within the heart behave like individual fibers, with fiber curvature providing a mechanism for polarization.

Evidence for a cortical origin of PI, especially in its later part, was derived from double cortical stimulation in previous studies and is further supported by examination of PI in patients with focal hemispheric unilateral brain lesions in the present study. Thirty patients with different sites of vascular or tumour lesions were studied by TMS. In 6 patients with circumscribed lesions of the primary sensorimotor cortex a significant shortening of PI to contralateral muscles was observed. In 7 patients with focal lesions of the thalamus or internal capsule, in 6 patients with lesions of the premotor cortex and in 5 patients with lesions restricted to the parietal or temporal lobe, a significant prolongation of PI to the contralateral muscles was detected. Six patients with transient ischemic attacks showed either prolongation or shortening of PI. We conclude that PI is predominantly generated in the primary motor cortex, correspondingly its damage causes shortening of PI.

We used peri-stimulus-time histograms to study the effect of cortical stimulation on single-motor unit firing patterns. We compared F-waves, H-reflexes and magnetic MEPs elicited during the CSSP to control responses elicited at rest and during voluntary contraction. CSSP duration depended on the intensity of cortical stimulation. However, we found no relationship between CSSP duration and MEP amplitude or muscle twitch force, thus the CSSP is not dependent solely on Renshaw cell inhibition or on changes in Ia and Ib afferent activity following the cortically induced muscle twitch. At low intensities of stimulation, the interval to resumption of motor unit firing following the peak in the peri-stimulus-time histogram corresponding to MEP latency sometimes exceeded that which could be accounted for by the motor unit's firing rate prior to the stimulus, suggesting that synchronization of motor unit firing by cortical stimulation cannot account for the CSSP. We found brief inhibition of F-waves during the CSSP in some subjects, reflecting activation of inhibitory corticospinal projections or segmental effects. In contrast, we observed longer inhibition of H-reflexes during the CSSP in all subjects, perhaps resulting from presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents.

In ten normal volunteers, a transcranial magnetic or electric stimulus that was subthreshold for evoking an EMG response in relaxed muscles was used to condition responses evoked by a later, suprathreshold magnetic or electric test shock. In most experiments the test stimulus was given to the lateral part of the motor strip in order to evoke EMG responses in the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). 2. A magnetic conditioning stimulus over the hand area of cortex could suppress responses produced in the relaxed FDI by a suprathreshold magnetic test stimulus at interstimulus intervals of 1-6 ms. At interstimulus intervals of 10 and 15 ms, the test response was facilitated. 3. Using a focal magnetic stimulus we explored the effects of moving the conditioning stimulus to different scalp locations while maintaining the magnetic test coil at one site. If the conditioning coil was moved anterior or posterior to the motor strip there was less suppression of test responses in the FDI. In contrast, stimulation at the vertex could suppress FDI responses by an amount comparable to that seen with stimulation over the hand area. With the positions of the two coils reversed, conditioning stimuli over the hand area suppressed responses evoked in leg muscles by vertex test shocks. 4. The intensity of both conditioning and test shocks influenced the amount of suppression. Small test responses were more readily suppressed than large responses. The best suppression was seen with small conditioning stimuli (0.7-0.9 times motor threshold in relaxed muscle); increasing the intensity to motor threshold or above resulted in less suppression or even facilitation. 5. Two experiments suggested that the suppression was produced by an action on cortical, rather than spinal excitability. First, a magnetic conditioning stimulus over the hand area failed to produce any suppression of responses evoked in active hand muscles by a small (approximately 200 V, 50 microsecond time constant) anodal electric test shock. Second, a vertex conditioning shock had no effect on forearm flexor H reflexes even though responses in the same muscles produced by magnetic cortical test shocks were readily suppressed at appropriate interstimulus intervals. 6.

Increasing the strength of TMS increased the response probability of a tonically firing motor unit and at the same time recruited new units which discharged phasically during the response peak. This demonstrates rate coding and recruitment of motor units by excitatory inputs resulting from TMS when the motoneurone pool is tonically facilitated by a constant voluntary drive. 4. Next, TMS was delivered without any voluntary facilitation of motoneurones. The order of recruitment for up to four different motor units discharged by TMS was compared to that observed with voluntary input. The threshold of recruitment for each of the two inputs was estimated from the surface EMG value at which the unit was recruited. For these motoneurone pools (eleven sets of observations), the order of recruitment was the same with TMS and voluntary inputs. 5.

Electrical stimuli were delivered using anode at the vertex and cathode 7 cm laterally. The corticospinal volley at threshold consisted of a single deflection with a mean latency to peak of 4.17 ms at the rostral recording site. With further increases in stimulus strength the latency of this D wave shortened in two steps, first by 0.89 ms (seven subjects) and then by a further 0.8 ms (two subjects), indicating that the site of activation of some corticospinal neurones had shifted to deep subcortical sites. 3.

The D wave remained the component of lowest threshold in all subjects, appearing at the low-cervical level with magnetic stimuli of 50%. However, in three subjects I waves also appeared at D wave threshold, and the D wave was smaller than with electrical stimulation at I wave threshold. There was no consistent change in latency of the magnetic D wave as stimulus intensity was increased to 100%. 5.

A conditioning magnetic shock completely suppressed the response evoked by a second magnetic shock, reduced the size of the response evoked by a single electrical shock but did not affect the response evoked by double electrical shocks. Inhibition of the test magnetic shock was also present during muscle contraction. 7. Our findings indicate that the first 50 ms of the silent period after TCS are produced mainly by spinal mechanisms such as after-hyperpolarization and recurrent inhibition of the spinal motoneurones. If descending inhibitory fibres contribute, their contribution is small. Changes in proprioceptive input probably have a minor influence. From 50 ms onwards the silent period is produced mainly by cortical inhibitory mechanisms.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "116 ( Pt 3)", "title": "Rapid modulation of human cortical motor outputs following ischaemic nerve block.", "issue": "", "pmid": "7957732", "authors": ["Brasil-Neto, JP", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Cammarota, A", "Amassian, VE", "Cracco, R", "Maccabee, P", "Cracco, J", "Hallett, M", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "A cap-shaped coil is introduced as a superior design for inducing transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials for spinal cord monitoring.

The latency of these saccades, which are thought to be mediated by collicular mechanisms without involvement of the cortex, was not affected by magnetic stimulation. This suggests that magnetic stimulation delays normal visually guided saccades by an action on the cerebral cortex, rather than on the oculomotor centres of the brainstem. Five subjects made non-targeted saccades in darkness in response to an auditory stimulus. These saccades, like visually guided saccades, could be delayed by magnetic brain stimulation. We conclude that saccadic delay is produced by interference with cortical areas involved in the execution of saccades rather than by interfering with the perception of the visual or auditory 'go' stimulus. These probably include supplementary and frontal eye field and posterior parietal cortex.

Guidelines for preventing the undesirable side effects of rTMS are offered.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Hereditary \"pure\" spastic paraplegia: a study of nine families.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "1933248", "authors": ["Polo, JM", "Calleja, J", "Combarros, O", "Berciano, J"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The influence of noninvasive magnetic brain stimulation by a magnetic coil (MC) placed over the occiput on perception and correct reporting of a briefly presented set of 3 letters of the alphabet was examined in 15 patients with prolonged VEP latencies due to neuritis of the optic nerve. The results derived from observing these patients were compared to the results obtained from an age-matched control group of 20 healthy voluntary subjects examined under the same experimental conditions. In both groups it was possible to demonstrate that transcranial magnetic stimulation is able to suppress recognition of the letters if applied with a certain delay time after a brief presentation of the visual stimulus. The groups were compared to each other with regard to the delay with which it was possible to demonstrate the most effective suppression. In the healthy subjects, this delay was found between 60 and 100 msec. In the patients, it was prolonged to 80-140 msec. This prolongation was closely related to the VEP latency (P100). Furthermore, visual suppression and the influence on it by different parameters were studied in detail in healthy subjects; the visual suppression depends on visual (e.g., brightness, duration) and magnetic (e.g., intensity) stimulus conditions. The method described seems to be of considerable value in the investigation of basic mechanisms of visual perception. This includes pathophysiological changes caused by optic neuritis and possibly other disorders affecting the visual system.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "[Motor evoked potentials].", "issue": "3", "pmid": "1992361", "authors": ["Boulu, P", "Dehen, H"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Presse m\u00e9dicale (Paris, France : 1983)", "abstract": "The actual site of excitation of the facial nerve by transcranial magnetic stimulation was investigated in five patients with hemifacial spasm who underwent microvascular decompression. The facial nerve was stimulated preoperatively and intraoperatively by transcranial magnetic stimulation and intraoperatively by electrical stimulation at its root exit zone with a minimum of surgical invasion of the facial nerves. The onset latency of compound muscle action potentials recorded from the nasalis muscle was 5.06 +/- 0.44 ms by magnetic stimulation and 5.08 +/- 0.43 ms by electrical stimulation. The latency difference was 0.06 +/- 0.08 ms. Therefore, transcranial magnetic stimulation was basically the same as electrical stimulation in onset latency.

Five different tissue types were incorporated into the model based on conductivities taken from the literature. The boundary value problem derived from Laplace's equation was solved with a quasi-static approximation. Transcranial electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes was poorly focussed and required high levels of current for stimulation of the cortex. Direct cortical stimulation with bipolar (adjacent) electrodes was found to be very effective in producing localized current flows. Unipolar cortical stimulation (with a more distant reference electrode) produced higher current densities at the same stimulating current as did bipolar stimulation, but stimulated a larger region of the cortex. With the simulated electrodes resting on the pia-arachnoid, as usually occurs clinically, there was significant shunting of the current (7/8 of the total current) through the CSF. Possible changes in electrodes and stimulation parameters that might improve stimulation procedures are considered.", "pages": "138-46"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Postexercise depression of motor evoked potentials: a measure of central nervous system fatigue.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "2621614", "authors": ["Brasil-Neto, JP", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Cammarota, A", "Cohen, LG", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It is not clear, however, if high-threshold MUs can also be activated and if they contribute to motor evoked potentials (MEPs). We therefore studied 11 high-threshold motor units in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 11 healthy subjects. Voluntary recruitment thresholds ranged from 22 to 41% (29.5 +/- 5.6%; mean +/- S.D.) of maximal muscle force. When MUs were driven at their recruitment thresholds, transcranial magnetic stimuli were applied to the vertex. Peri-stimulus time histograms of MU discharges were constructed. All MUs studied revealed a period of increased firing probability at 19-27 ms after the stimulus (primary peak). Stimulus intensities were lower by 10-57% of the maximal stimulator output than required to produce near maximal MEPs in conventional surface EMG recordings in the same subjects.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation, with an 8-shaped coil centred over the same scalp positions, was delivered simultaneously with, and at different intervals after, the finger stimulus. The results of the right index (reading) finger in Braille readers were compared with those of their left index (non-reading) finger and of the right and left index fingers of the control subjects. The scalp areas from which we recorded N20 and P22 components of the SEP with an amplitude of at least 70% of the maximal amplitude recorded in each trial were significantly larger in SEPs evoked from the reading fingers. Detection of the stimulus applied to the reading finger was blocked by TMS delivered over a larger contralateral scalp area and during a longer time window after the stimulus.

Single stimuli were delivered at intervals from 15 s to 3 min. Studies were performed with and without perfusion of fluid into the pharynx and upper esophagus. Results showed that magnetic stimulation produced a twitch contraction of the UES when stimulus intensity was above a threshold that varied between 14 and 20% of the stimulator output. Increasing stimulus intensity progressively increased twitch amplitude. Magnetic stimulation also induced swallowing, above a stimulus threshold similar to that for induction of the UES twitch contraction. Fluid perfusion augmented the ability of the magnetic stimulus to induce swallowing. We concluded that a magnetically induced single electrical stimulus of the cerebral cortex produces UES contraction and induces swallowing. The effect on swallowing is facilitated by sensory stimulation of the pharynx. This technique holds the potential for further study of 1) motor and sensory neural mechanisms involved in the control of swallowing and 2) the assessment and management of oropharyngeal dysphagia in humans.", "pages": "138-46"}]
