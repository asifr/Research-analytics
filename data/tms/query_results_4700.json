Indeed, in subjects performing a motor task, there is uncertainty as to whether TMS-evoked outputs reflect the ongoing behavior or, alternatively, a disrupted motor plan. Considering force direction and magnitude to reflect qualitative and quantitative features of the motor plan respectively, we studied the relationships between voluntary forces and those evoked by TMS. In five healthy adults, we recorded the isometric forces acting a hand joint and the electromyographic activity in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Responses obtained at rest were highly invariant. Evoked responses obtained while subjects generated static and dynamic contractions were highly codirectional with the voluntary forces. Such directional relationships were independent of stimulation intensity, stimulated cortical volume, or magnitude of voluntary force exerted. Dynamic force generation was associated with a marked increase in the magnitude of the evoked force that was linearly related to the rate of force generation. The timing of central conduction was different depending on functional role of the target muscle, as either agonist or joint fixator. These results indicate that the architecture of motor plans remain grossly undisrupted by cortical stimulation applied during voluntary motor behavior. The significant magnitude modulation of responses during dynamic force generation suggests an essential role of the corticospinal system in the specification of force changes. Finally, the corticospinal activation depends on the functional role assumed by the target muscle, either postural or agonist.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on auditory hallucinations refractory to clozapine.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "17960967", "authors": ["Rosa, MO", "Gattaz, WF", "Rosa, MA", "Rumi, DO", "Tavares, H", "Myczkowski, M", "Sartorelli, MC", "Rigonatti, SP", "Elkis, H", "Cabral, SB", "Teixeira, MJ", "Marcolin, MA"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Journal of clinical psychiatry", "abstract": "To study the therapeutic effects on auditory hallucinations refractory to clozapine with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied on the left temporoparietal cortex.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Occipital transcranial magnetic stimulation has opposing effects on visual and auditory stimulus detection: implications for multisensory interactions.", "issue": "43", "pmid": "17959789", "authors": ["Romei, V", "Murray, MM", "Merabet, LB", "Thut, G"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Eleven patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) experiencing auditory hallucinations (unresponsive to clozapine) were randomly assigned to receive either active of rTMS (N = 6) or sham stimulation (N = 5) (with concomitant use of clozapine) using a double-masked, sham-controlled, parallel design.

Single-pulse TMS was applied over the occipital pole at short delays (30-150 ms) after external stimulus onset. Relative to TMS over a control site, reactions times (RTs) to unisensory visual stimuli were prolonged by TMS at 60-75 ms poststimulus onset (visual suppression effect), confirming stimulation of functional visual cortex. Conversely, RTs to unisensory auditory stimuli were significantly shortened when visual cortex was stimulated by TMS at the same delays (beneficial interaction effect of auditory stimulation and occipital TMS). No TMS-effect on RTs was observed for AV stimulation. The beneficial interaction effect of combined unisensory auditory and TMS-induced visual cortex stimulation matched and was correlated with the RT-facilitation after external multisensory AV stimulation without TMS, suggestive of multisensory interactions between the stimulus-evoked auditory and TMS-induced visual cortex activities. A follow-up experiment showed that auditory input enhances excitability within visual cortex itself (using phosphene-induction via TMS as a measure) over a similarly early time-window (75-120 ms).

Participants undertook a combined stop-signal/flanker task after rTMS of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) or dorsal premotor cortex (dPM) in each hemisphere.

The observed double dissociation of neurodisruptive effects between the right IFG and right dPM further implies that response inhibition and execution rely on distinct neural processes despite activating a common cortical network.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Treatment of bipolar disorder: a complex treatment for a multi-faceted disorder.", "issue": "", "pmid": "8175381", "authors": ["Fountoulakis, KN", "Vieta, E", "Siamouli, M", "Valenti, M", "Magiria, S", "Oral, T", "Fresno, D", "Giannakopoulos, P", "Kaprinis, GS"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Annals of general psychiatry", "abstract": "In humans, it is well established that practicing simple, repetitive movements with the distal upper limb induces short-term plasticity in the neural pathways that control training.

The purpose of this study was to quantify how ballistic training at proximal and distal upper limb joints influences measures of corticomotor plasticity. To accomplish this goal, we had subjects repetitively practice simple movements for 30 min using the index finger, wrist, or elbow. Before and after training, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to activate the corticomotor pathways innervating the trained joint. We assessed the effect of training by quantifying changes in TMS-elicited joint movements and motor-evoked potentials in the training agonists and antagonists. These measures of training-induced neural plasticity were graded from distal to proximal in the upper limb. Training had the greatest immediate effect on the pathways controlling the index finger and this effect decreased for more proximal joints. Our results suggest that the relative sizes and properties of the cortical areas controlling the proximal and distal upper limb influence the effect of training on the corticomotor pathways.

We investigated the effect of 30-min training of simultaneous activation of ankle dorsi- and plantarflexor muscles (cocontraction task) on the SOL H-reflex in 10 healthy volunteers. Measurements were taken during cocontraction. After training, there was a significant improvement in the ability of the subjects to perform a stable cocontraction. SOL H-reflex recruitment curves and H-max/M-max ratios were decreased after cocontraction training but not after 30 min of static dorsi or plantarflexion. The decreased H-reflex size correlated with improved motor performance. No changes in SOL and tibialis anterior (TA) EMG activity or EMG power were observed, suggesting that increased presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents is a likely mechanism for H-reflex depression. In different sessions we measured SOL and TA motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), TMS-elicited suppression of SOL EMG, and coherence between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (Cz) and TA and SOL EMG. SOL and TA MEPs were depressed, whereas TMS-elicited suppression of SOL EMG and coherence were increased after training. Decreased excitability of corticospinal neurons due to increased intracortical inhibition seems a likely explanation of these observations.

In eight normal volunteers, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and tDCS was given with electrodes over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the contralateral orbit. We performed two experiments: one for short duration tDCS (100 ms, 1, 3 or 5 mA) and the other for long duration tDCS (10 min, 1 mA). The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the onset of tDCS and TMS were 1-7 and 10-120 ms for the former experiment. In the latter experiment, TMS was given 0-20 min after the end of 10 min tDCS. We evaluated the effect of tDCS on the motor cortex by comparing MEPs conditioned by tDCS with control MEPs. Cathodal short duration tDCS significantly reduced the size of responses to motor cortical stimulation at SOAs of 1-7 ms when the intensity was equal to or greater than 3 mA. Anodal short duration tDCS significantly increased MEPs when the intensity was 3 mA, but the enhancement did not occur when using 5 mA conditioning stimulus. Moreover, both anodal and cathodal short duration tDCS decreased responses to TMS significantly at SOAs of 20-50 ms and enhanced them at an SOA of 90 ms. Long duration cathodal tDCS decreased MEPs at 0 and 5 min after the offset of tDCS and anodal long duration tDCS increased them at 1 and 15 min. We conclude that the effect at SOAs less than 10 ms is mainly caused by acute changes in resting membrane potential induced by tDCS. The effect at SOAs of 20-100 ms is considered to be a nonspecific effect of a startle-like response produced by activation of skin sensation at the scalp.

Participants consisted of 22 older adults (age range 58-76 years) of whom 11 were medicated patients diagnosed with PD (patient group) and 11 were age-matched healthy controls (healthy group). Corticomotor facilitation was assessed by monitoring the changes in the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in muscles of the right hand (first dorsal interosseous: FDI; and abductor digiti minimi: ADM) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. In each group, corticomotor facilitation was assessed with participants seated in front of a computer screen under four testing conditions: (1) REST: eyes closed and instructions to relax for 10 s, (2) OBS: observe action, (3) IMAG: imagine action and (4) IMIT: imitate action. The action depicted in the video displayed the hand of a male subject cutting a piece of material with scissors. Comparison of variations in MEP amplitude revealed a significant interaction between groups and conditions. In the healthy group, the OBS and IMAG conditions were both associated with significant facilitation in the FDI and ADM, whereas the same conditions failed to produce facilitation in the PD group. In both groups, the IMIT condition produced the largest facilitation in hand muscles. Further planned comparisons revealed a significant difference between groups in the FDI for the OBS condition. From these findings, we conclude that, even when properly medicated, old adults with PD may experience major difficulties in engaging the motor system for covert actions, particularly when asked to observe another person's action. This failure of corticomotor facilitation for covert actions appears to be linked with the deficit in motor activation associated with basal ganglia dysfunction in PD and in line with the difficulty experienced in general by patients \"to energize\" the motor system in preparation for action.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "The essential role of premotor cortex in speech perception.", "issue": "19", "pmid": "12208488", "authors": ["Meister, IG", "Wilson, SM", "Deblieck, C", "Wu, AD", "Iacoboni, M"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Manic-depression or bipolar disorder (BD) is a multi-faceted illness with an inevitably complex treatment.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "The use of tDCS and CVS as methods of non-invasive brain stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12361876", "authors": ["Been, G", "Ngo, TT", "Miller, SM", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research reviews", "abstract": "This article summarizes the current status of our knowledge and practice of its treatment.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "266", "title": "Neural response to transcranial magnetic stimulation in adult hypothyroidism and effect of replacement treatment.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "12364537", "authors": ["Rizzo, V", "Crupi, D", "Bagnato, S", "Quartarone, A", "Benvenga, S", "Bartolone, L", "Ghilardi, MF", "Trimarchi, F", "Girlanda, P", "Battaglia, F"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "It is widely accepted that lithium is moderately useful during all phases of bipolar illness and it might possess a specific effectiveness on suicidal prevention.

However, causal relationships between local brain activity in the RH and metaphors comprehension were never established. In addition, most studies have focused on familiar metaphoric expressions which might be processed similarly to any conventional word combination. The present study was designed to overcome these two problems by employing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to examine the role of the RH in processing novel metaphoric expressions taken from poetry. Right-handed participants were presented with four types of word pairs, literal, conventional metaphoric and novel metaphoric expressions, and unrelated word pairs, and were asked to perform a semantic judgment task. rTMS of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus disrupted processing of novel but not conventional metaphors, whereas rTMS over the left inferior frontal gyrus selectively impaired processing of literal word pairs and conventional but not novel metaphors (Experiment 1). In a further experiment, we showed that these effects were due to right-left asymmetries rather than posterior-anterior differences (Experiment 2). This is the first demonstration of TMS-induced impairment in processing novel metaphoric expressions, and as such, confirms the specialization of the RH in the activation of a broader range of related meanings than the left hemisphere, including novel, nonsalient meanings. The findings thus suggest that the RH may be critically involved in at least one important component of novel metaphor comprehension, the integration of the individual meanings of two seemingly unrelated concepts into a meaningful metaphoric expression.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Pain in chronic pancreatitis: a salutogenic mechanism or a maladaptive brain response?", "issue": "5-6", "pmid": "11164943", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Freedman, SD"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

This finding has led to speculation that interventions that interfere with the maintenance of corticostriatal LTP might be useful as antidyskinetic treatments. One approach that is known to reduce cortical hyperexcitability in human disorders is the delivery of a long train of low-frequency ( approximately 1 Hz) stimulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. This stimulation protocol is remarkably similar to that used in brain slices to reverse previously induced LTP, and consequently it has been used in patients with Huntington's disease or levodopa-induced dyskinesia to try to interfere with the abnormal corticostriatal plasticity postulated to underlie the motor disturbances in these conditions.

Single-pulse \"focal\" TMS was applied at intensities varying between 90% and 200% of motor thresholds to the right motor cortex of 15 healthy volunteers. The peak-to peak size of MEP responses and the duration of the CSP were measured in small hand muscles.

The absolute duration of CSP and the size MEPs correlated significantly and to a similar extent with stimulus intensity (r = 0.60 and 0.53, respectively). The slope of the MEP-S-R was steeper compared with CSP-S-R, particularly at low stimulation intensities. CSP duration saturated earlier and CSP-S-Rs were shifted upwards at a given stimulus intensity compared with MEP-S-Rs.

Whether changes in engagement in the sensorimotor cortex occur in humans after stroke currently is an area of much interest. The present study conducted a meta-analysis on stroke studies examining changes in neural representations following therapy specifically targeting the upper extremity to determine if rehabilitation-related motor recovery is associated with neural plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere. Twenty-eight studies investigating upper extremity neural representations (e.g., TMS, fMRI, PET, or SPECT) were identified, and 13 met inclusion criteria as upper extremity intervention training studies. Common outcome variables representing changes in the primary motor and sensorimotor cortices were used in calculating standardized effect sizes for each study. The primary fixed effects model meta-analysis revealed a large overall effect size (ES=0.84, S.D.=0.15, 95% CI=0.76-0.93). Moreover, a fail-safe analysis indicated that 42 null effect studies would be necessary to lower the overall effect size to an insignificant level.

The subsequent discovery that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could have long-lasting effects on cortical excitability spawned a broad interest in the use of this technique as a new therapeutic method in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the current outcomes from initial trials include some conflicting results, initial evidence supports that rTMS might have a therapeutic value in different neurologic conditions. Methods.\u2002 We reviewed the results of clinical trials of rTMS on four different disorders: stroke, Parkinson's disease, chronic refractory pain, and epilepsy. We reviewed randomized, controlled studies only in order to obtain the strongest evidence for the clinical effects of rTMS. Results.\u2002 An extensive literature review revealed 32 articles that met our criteria. From these studies, we found evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS, particularly in the relief of chronic pain and motor neurorehabilitation in single hemisphere stroke patients. Repetitive TMS also seems to have a therapeutic effect on motor function in Parkinson's disease, but the evidence is somewhat confounded by the uncontrolled variability of multiple factors. Lastly, only two randomized, sham-controlled studies have been performed for epilepsy; although evidence indicates rTMS may reduce seizure frequency in patients with neocortical foci, more research is needed to confirm these initial findings. Conclusions.\u2002 There is mounting evidence for the efficacy of rTMS in the short-term treatment of certain neurologic conditions.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the time course of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) inhibition by LICI, likely mediated through postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors, is different from SICI inhibition by LICI, likely mediated through presynaptic GABA(B) receptors. Nine healthy volunteers were studied and MEP were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle.

In eight healthy subjects, slow (1 Hz) or rapid (10 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulations (rTMS), which are known to induce opposite changes on cortical excitability, applied on S1 did not modify LF-SEPs, while HF-SEPs showed a series of dissociate changes in the early and later high-frequency burst, moreover occurring with a different time-course. Slow rTMS caused an immediate and lasting decrease of the later burst activity, coupled with an immediate increase of the earlier part of the burst, suggesting that inhibition of cortical excitability triggered opposite, compensatory effects at subcortical levels; rapid rTMS induced a delayed increase of later HF-SEPs, leaving unaltered the earlier subcortical burst.

Two groups performing either a postural stability maintenance training (SMT) or a ballistic ankle strength training (BST) were compared to a non-training group. The hypothesis was that practicing of a self-initiated voluntary movement would facilitate cortico-spinal projections, while practicing fast automatic adjustments during stabilization of stance would reduce excitatory influence from the primary motor cortex. Training effects were expected to be confined to the practiced task. To test for training specificity, motor evoked potentials (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded at rest and during motor tasks that were similar to each training. Intracortical, cortico-spinal, as well as spinal parameters were assessed at rest and during these tasks. The results show high task and training specificity. Training effects were only observable during performance of the trained task. While MEP size was decreased in the SMT group for the trained tasks, MEP recruitment was increased in the BST group in the trained task only. The control group did not show any changes. Background electromyogram levels, M. soleus H-reflex amplitudes and intracortical parameters were unaltered. In summary, it is suggested that the changes of MEP parameters in both training groups, but not in the control group, reflect cortical motor plasticity. While cortico-spinal activation was enhanced in the BST group, SMT may be associated with improved motor control through increased inhibitory trans-cortical effects. Since spinal excitability remained unaltered, changes most likely occur on the supraspinal level.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Anticipatory postural adjustment before bimanual unloading reactions: the role of the motor cortex in motor learning.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "17941965", "authors": ["Kazennikov, OV", "Solopova, IA", "Talis, VL", "Ioffe, ME"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neuroscience and behavioral physiology", "abstract": "Electrophysiological recordings from monkeys, as well as functional imaging and neuropsychological work with humans, have suggested that a region in the anterior portion of the intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) is involved in prehensile movements. With recent methodological advances using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we can now causally attribute anatomy with function to more precisely determine the specific involvement of aIPS in grasping. It has recently been demonstrated that aIPS is specifically involved in executing a grasp under conditions of both constant target requirements, as well as in correcting a movement under conditions in which a target perturbation occurs. In the present study, we extend these findings by determining the differential contribution of the left and right hemisphere to executing a grasping movement with the left and right hands. Transient disruption of left aIPS at movement onset impairs grasping with the right but not the left hand, and disruption of right aIPS impairs grasping with the left but not the right hand. We conclude that grasping is a lateralized process, relying exclusively on the contralateral hemisphere, and discuss the implications of these findings in relationship to models of hemispheric dominance for motor control.", "pages": "103-16"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Functional vibratory stimulation on the hand facilitates voluntary movements of a hemiplegic upper limb in a patient with stroke.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17244172", "authors": ["Shirahashi, I", "Matsumoto, S", "Shimodozono, M", "Etoh, S", "Kawahira, K"], "year": "2007", "journal": "International journal of rehabilitation research.
