In clinical practice, spinal cord imaging in ALS is performed primarily to rule out alternative conditions in the diagnostic phase of the disease. Quantitative spinal cord imaging has traditionally been regarded as challenging, as it requires high spatial resolution while minimizing partial volume effects, physiological motion and susceptibility distortions. In recent years however, as acquisition and post-processing methods have been perfected, a number of exciting and promising quantitative spinal imaging and electrophysiology techniques have been developed. We performed a systematic review of the trends, methodologies, limitations and conclusions of recent spinal cord studies in ALS to explore the diagnostic and prognostic potential of spinal markers. Novel corrective techniques for quantitative spinal cord imaging are systematically reviewed. Recent findings demonstrate that imaging techniques previously used in brain imaging, such as diffusion tensor, functional and metabolic imaging can now be successfully applied to the human spinal cord. Optimized electrophysiological approaches make the non-invasive assessment of corticospinal pathways possible, and multimodal spinal techniques are likely to increase the specificity and sensitivity of proposed spinal markers. In conclusion, spinal cord imaging is an emerging area of ALS biomarker research. Novel quantitative spinal modalities have already been successfully used in ALS animal models and have the potential for development into sensitive ALS biomarkers in humans.", "pages": "407-15"}, {"volume": "123", "title": "Cortical activation to voluntary movement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is related to corticospinal damage: electrophysiological evidence.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "22326728", "authors": ["Riva, N", "Falini, A", "Inuggi, A", "Gonzalez-Rosa, JJ", "Amadio, S", "Cerri, F", "Fazio, R", "Del Carro, U", "Comola, M", "Comi, G", "Leocani, L"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The time course of mu and beta sensorimotor rhythms, with event-related desynchronisation (ERD) to preparation and execution of voluntary movement followed by synchronisation (ERS) after movement, is considered to indicate cortical activation and idling, respectively.

According to visual learning theories, an early, fast learning phase driven by high-level areas is followed by a late, asymptotic learning phase driven by low-level, retinotopic areas when higher resolution is required. Thus, low-level areas would not contribute to learning and offline consolidation until late learning. Recent studies have challenged this notion, demonstrating modified responses to trained stimuli in primary visual cortex (V1) and offline activity after very limited training. However, the behavioral relevance of modified V1 activity for offline consolidation of visual skill memory in V1 after early training sessions remains unclear. Here, we used neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) directed to a trained retinotopic V1 location to test for behaviorally relevant consolidation in human low-level visual cortex. Applying TMS to the trained V1 location within 45 min of the first or second training session strongly interfered with learning, as measured by impaired performance the next day. The interference was conditional on task context and occurred only when training in the location targeted by TMS was followed by training in a second location before TMS. In this condition, high-level areas may become coupled to the second location and uncoupled from the previously trained low-level representation, thereby rendering consolidation vulnerable to interference. Our data show that, during the earliest phases of skill learning in the lowest-level visual areas, a behaviorally relevant form of consolidation exists of which the robustness is controlled by high-level, contextual factors.", "pages": "407-15"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Safety and tolerability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with pathologic positive sensory phenomena: a review of literature.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8938024", "authors": ["Muller, PA", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Rotenberg, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that hypoxia centrally affects performance independently of afferent feedback and peripheral fatigue, we conducted two experiments under complete vascular occlusion of the exercising muscle under different systemic O(2) environmental conditions.

Given the critical role of M1 in upper limb motor adaptation and the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to increase cortical excitability, we hypothesized that anodal tDCS over leg M1 and premotor cortices would increase the size and duration of the locomotor aftereffect. Thirty healthy volunteers received either sham or real tDCS (anodal bihemispheric tDCS; 2 mA for 15 min at rest) to induce excitatory effects over the primary motor and premotor cortex before walking onto the moving platform. The real tDCS group, compared with sham, displayed larger trunk sway and increased gait velocity in the first AFTER trial and a persistence of the trunk sway aftereffect into the second AFTER trial. We also used transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe changes in cortical leg excitability using different electrode montages and eyeblink conditioning, before and after tDCS, as well as simulating the current flow of tDCS on the human brain using a computational model of these different tDCS montages. Our data show that anodal tDCS induces excitability changes in lower limb motor cortex with resultant enhancement of locomotor adaptation aftereffects.

It has been recently proposed that hypoxia-induced cerebral perturbations may also contribute to exercise performance limitation. A significant reduction in cerebral oxygenation during whole body exercise has been reported in hypoxia compared with normoxia, while changes in cerebral perfusion may depend on the brain region, the level of arterial oxygenation and hyperventilation induced alterations in arterial CO(2). With the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation, inconsistent changes in cortical excitability have been reported in hypoxia, whereas a greater impairment in maximal voluntary activation following a fatiguing exercise has been suggested when arterial O(2) content is reduced. Electromyographic recordings during exercise showed an accelerated rise in central motor drive in hypoxia, probably to compensate for greater muscle contractile fatigue. This accelerated development of muscle fatigue in moderate hypoxia may be responsible for increased inhibitory afferent signals to the central nervous system leading to impaired central drive. In severe hypoxia (arterial O(2) saturation <70-75%), cerebral hypoxia per se may become an important contributor to impaired performance and reduced motor drive during prolonged exercise. This review examines the effects of acute and chronic reduction in arterial O(2) (and CO(2)) on cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation, neuronal function, and central drive to the muscles. Direct and indirect influences of arterial deoxygenation on central command are separated.

It has been suggested that the association between plasticity and connectivity contributes to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of schizophrenia. However, little is known about the impact of glutamate-dependent long-term depression (LTD)-like cortical plasticity on inter-hemispheric connectivity in schizophrenia patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate LTD-like cortical plasticity following excitability-diminishing cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left primary motor cortex (M1) and its effects on the non-stimulated right M1. Eighteen schizophrenia patients and 18 matched (age, gender, handedness, and smoking status) control subjects were investigated in this study. Corticospinal excitability changes following tDCS and intra-cortical inhibitory circuits were monitored with transcranial magnetic stimulation. On the stimulated hemisphere, cathodal tDCS increased resting motor thresholds (RMT) in both groups and decreased motor-evoked potential (MEP) sizes in healthy controls to a greater extent compared to schizophrenia patients. On the non-stimulated hemisphere, RMTs were increased and MEPs were decreased only in the healthy control group. Our results confirm previous findings of reduced LTD-like plasticity in schizophrenia patients and offer hypothetical and indirect in vivo evidence for an association between LTD-like cortical plasticity and inter-hemispheric connectivity in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, our findings highlight the impact of plasticity on connectivity. Dysfunctional N-methyl D-aspartate receptors or modulation of dopaminergic transmission can explain these findings.

While the use of TMS has expanded to the study of many systems and processes during this time, the original application and perhaps one of the most common uses of TMS involves studying the physiology, plasticity and function of the human neuromuscular system. Single pulse TMS applied to the motor cortex excites pyramidal neurons transsynaptically (Figure 1) and results in a measurable electromyographic response that can be used to study and evaluate the integrity and excitability of the corticospinal tract in humans. Additionally, recent advances in magnetic stimulation now allows for partitioning of cortical versus spinal excitability. For example, paired-pulse TMS can be used to assess intracortical facilitatory and inhibitory properties by combining a conditioning stimulus and a test stimulus at different interstimulus intervals. In this video article we will demonstrate the methodological and technical aspects of these techniques. Specifically, we will demonstrate single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS techniques as applied to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle as well as the erector spinae (ES) musculature. Our laboratory studies the FCR muscle as it is of interest to our research on the effects of wrist-hand cast immobilization on reduced muscle performance, and we study the ES muscles due to these muscles clinical relevance as it relates to low back pain. With this stated, we should note that TMS has been used to study many muscles of the hand, arm and legs, and should iterate that our demonstrations in the FCR and ES muscle groups are only selected examples of TMS being used to study the human neuromuscular system.", "pages": "407-15"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Impact of one HF-rTMS session on fine motor function in right-handed healthy female subjects: a comparison of stimulation over the left versus the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15147322", "authors": ["Baeken, C", "Schrijvers, DL", "Sabbe, BG", "Vanderhasselt, MA", "De Raedt, R"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropsychobiology", "abstract": "We report a patient showing isolated phonological agraphia after an ischemic stroke involving the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG).

Disambiguating self-motion versus object-motion also invokes higher order mechanisms, and a cortical visuovestibular reciprocal antagonism is propounded. Hence, one prediction is of a vestibular modulation of visual cortical excitability and indirect measures have variously suggested none, focal or global effects of activation or suppression in human visual cortex.

Vestibular activation significantly modulated phosphene response entropy for V5/MT but not EVC, implying a specific vestibular effect on V5/MT responses.

Third, it should combine hypothesis testing with data-driven analysis including interactive visualization tools that would make it as easy as possible to look at and explore data. A fourth guiding principle was to develop a software package that fulfilled the author's preference for elegant user interfaces, beautiful visualizations and high-performance computing.

These techniques include those applied to the brain through the intact skull, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation, or those applied to the sensorimotor system in the periphery, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Recent research has demonstrated that each of these techniques, either by themselves or in combination with these and other treatments, can, under certain circumstances, modify the excitability of motor representations of muscles involved in swallowing. In some studies, experimentally induced plastic changes have been shown to have functional relevance for swallowing biomechanics.

As the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) plays a key role in the sensorimotor processing involved in shaping finger movements and has many projections onto the primary motor cortex (M1), we hypothesized that the PMv-M1 connections might play a role in surround inhibition. A paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm was used in order to evaluate and compare the PMv-M1 interactions during different phases (rest, preparation and execution) of an index finger movement in patients with FHD and controls. A sub-threshold conditioning pulse (80% resting motor threshold) was applied to the PMv at 6 ms before M1 stimulation. The right abductor pollicis brevis, a surround muscle, was the target muscle. In healthy controls, the results showed that PMv stimulation induced an ipsilateral ventral premotor-motor inhibition at rest. This cortico-cortical interaction changed into an early facilitation (100 ms before movement onset) and turned back to inhibition 50 ms later. In patients with FHD, this PMv-M1 interaction and its modulation were absent. Our results show that, although the ipsilateral ventral premotor-motor inhibition does not play a key role in the genesis of surround inhibition, PMv has a dynamic influence on M1 excitability during the early steps of motor execution.

SICI was studied using the paired pulse paradigm (2-ms interval): test TMS intensity was varied to evoke peaks of different size in post-discharge histograms, reflecting the corticospinal excitatory post-synaptic potential in the relevant spinal motoneuron, and conditioning TMS intensity was constant (0.6 \u00d7 the resting motor threshold). Navigated brain stimulation was used to monitor the coil position. A linear relationship was observed between test peak size and test TMS intensity, reflecting linear summation of excitatory inputs induced by TMS. SICI was estimated using the difference between conditioned (produced by the paired pulses) and test peaks (produced by the isolated test pulse). Although the conditioning intensity (activating cortical inhibitory interneurons mediating SICI) was kept constant throughout the experiments, the level of SICI changed with the test peak size, in a non-linear fashion, suggesting that low-threshold cortical neurons (excitatory interneurons/pyramidal cells) are less sensitive to SICI than those of higher threshold. These findings provide the first experimental evidence, under physiological conditions, for non-linear input/output properties of a complex cortical network. Consequently, changes in the recruitment gain of cortical inhibitory interneurons can greatly modify the excitability of pyramidal cells and their response to afferent inputs.", "pages": "407-15"}, {"volume": "2011", "title": "Changes in input-output relations in the corticospinal pathway to the lower limb muscles during robot-assisted passive stepping.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18184886", "authors": ["Kamibayashi, K", "Nakajima, T", "Takahashi, M", "Nakazawa, K"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

We explored the neural correlates of response preparation, generation, and inhibition using single- and paired-pulse TMS, which was administered at various times between WS and IS (response preparation phase) and between IS and onset of response-related muscle activity in the right thumb (response generation phase). Both groups exhibited increases in motor-evoked potential amplitudes (relative to WS onset) during response generation; however, this increase began earlier and was more pronounced for the younger adults in the go condition. Moreover, younger adults showed a general decrease in short-interval intracortical inhibition during response preparation in both the go and no-go conditions, which was not observed in older adults. Importantly, correlation analysis suggested that for older adults the task-related increases of corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition were associated with faster RT.

Mounting convergent evidence for the importance of the anterior temporal lobe in semantic memory is found in patients with bilateral anterior temporal lobe damage (e.g. semantic dementia), functional neuroimaging and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies. If this proposal is correct, then one might expect patients with anterior temporal lobe resection for long-standing temporal lobe epilepsy to be semantically impaired. Such patients, however, do not present clinically with striking comprehension deficits but with amnesia and variable anomia, leading some to conclude that semantic memory is intact in resection for temporal lobe epilepsy and thus casting doubt over the conclusions drawn from semantic dementia and linked basic neuroscience studies. Whilst there is a considerable neuropsychological literature on temporal lobe epilepsy, few studies have probed semantic memory directly, with mixed results, and none have undertaken the same type of systematic investigation of semantic processing that has been conducted with other patient groups. In this study, therefore, we investigated the semantic performance of 20 patients with resection for chronic temporal lobe epilepsy with a full battery of semantic assessments, including more sensitive measures of semantic processing. The results provide a bridge between the current clinical observations about resection for temporal lobe epilepsy and the expectations from semantic dementia and other neuroscience findings. Specifically, we found that on simple semantic tasks, the patients' accuracy fell in the normal range, with the exception that some patients with left resection for temporal lobe epilepsy had measurable anomia. Once the semantic assessments were made more challenging, by probing specific-level concepts, lower frequency/more abstract items or measuring reaction times on semantic tasks versus those on difficulty-matched non-semantic assessments, evidence of a semantic impairment was found in all individuals. We conclude by describing a unified, computationally inspired framework for capturing the variable degrees of semantic impairment found across different patient groups (semantic dementia, temporal lobe epilepsy, glioma and stroke) as well as semantic processing in neurologically intact participants.", "pages": "407-15"}, {"volume": "2011", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation coil with electronically switchable active and sham modes.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18441418", "authors": ["Deng, ZD", "Peterchev, AV"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Converging evidence has begun to reveal that the brain produces interference independently from other aspects of memory processing, which suggests that interference may have an important but previously overlooked function. A memory's initial susceptibility to interference and subsequent resistance to interference after its acquisition has revealed that memories continue to be processed 'off-line' during consolidation. Recent work has demonstrated that off-line processing is not limited to just the stabilization of a memory, which was once the defining characteristic of consolidation; instead, off-line processing can have a rich diversity of effects, from enhancing performance to making hidden rules explicit. Off-line processing also occurs after memory retrieval when memories are destabilized and then subsequently restabalized during reconsolidation.

Reorganization theory of motor circuits in the cerebral cortex contributing to recovery following stroke is proposed. In acute stage motor recovery depends on residual corticospinal tract excitability from onset to 3 months (1(st) stage recovery) . In next stage alternative output system is used according to intracortical excitability depending on intracortical disinhibition at the peak of 3 months (2(nd) stage recovery) . At 6 months and beyond training-induced synaptic strengthening becomes better established, and new networks are better reorganized (3(rd)stage recovery) . Stroke rehabilitation programs from acute stage are required depending on this stage theory. With each stage to select and perform the most effective rehabilitation programs are necessary. Two obstruction factors of motor recovery are indicated. One of them is Wallerian degeneration of corticospinal tract. Early Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract that is seen on diffusion weighted MRI was reported. The appearance of Wallerian degeneration at acute stage should be directed to more attention as motor recovery inhibition. Next obstruction factor is development of spasticity from acute stage. Spastic paresis is subjected over time to immobilization of the paretic body part and chronic disuse of the paretic body part, which are avoidable through early rehabilitation intervention. Recently various interventions were proposed for motor recovery. The combination of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intensive occupational therapy by Abo (2010) are recommended to recovery hand function at chronic stage as 3(rd) stage recovery.", "pages": "407-15"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "A gender comparison of central and peripheral neuromuscular function after exercise.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "5775600", "authors": ["Stern, A", "Kuenze, C", "Herman, D", "Sauer, LD", "Hart, JM"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of sport rehabilitation", "abstract": "The frequency of inflammatory episodes in the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been correlated with late neurodegeneration, but the mechanism by which inflammation gives rise to delayed neuronal damage is unknown.

The cause of this variability is multidimensional and to some extent still unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that individual variations in cortical thickness can explain some of the variability of PAS-induced excitability changes. Ten minutes of a facilitatory PAS protocol (PAS(LTP)) rapidly increased corticospinal excitability in the majority of the subjects (14/19 subjects) while others showed no such effect (5/19 subjects). A whole brain correlation analysis based on high resolution T1-weighted images revealed a significant positive relationship of PAS(LTP)-induced excitability changes with cortical thickness of the underlying left sensorimotor cortex (SM1) only. Cortical thickness alone, among other potential influencing factors, explained about half of the PAS(LTP) variance, indicating that subjects with a strong after-effect were those with thicker gray matter in this region. Based on these findings, we provide novel evidence that local brain structure influences the individual amount of functional plasticity induced by PAS(LTP).

Performance was measured before and after 20 sec of continuous theta burst stimulation of PMC, pSTS, and control (each tested on different days). A matched nonbiological object motion task (detecting point-light displays of translating polygons) served as a further control. Data were analyzed within the signal detection framework. Sensitivity (d') significantly decreased after TMS of PMC. There was a marginally significant decline in d' after TMS of pSTS but not of control site. Criterion (response bias) was also significantly affected by TMS over PMC. Specifically, subjects made significantly more false alarms post-TMS of PMC. These effects were specific to biological motion and not found for the nonbiological control task. To summarize, we report that TMS over PMC reduces sensitivity to biological motion perception. Furthermore, pSTS and PMC may have distinct roles in biological motion processing as behavioral performance differs following TMS in each area. Only TMS over PMC led to a significant increase in false alarms, which was not found for other brain areas or for the control task. TMS of PMC may have interfered with refining judgments about biological motion perception, possibly because access to the perceiver's own motor representations was compromised.", "pages": "407-15"}]
