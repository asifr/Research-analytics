We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the temporal organization of the cortical control of memory-guided saccades in eight humans. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPFC), which are both known to be involved in the control of such saccades, were stimulated on the right side at different time intervals after the presentation of a flashed lateral visual target. The memorization delay was 2,000 ms. Single pulses were applied at 160, 260, and 360 ms after the flashed target, during the period of 700 and 1,500 ms, and finally at 2,100 ms, i.e., 100 ms after the extinguishing of the central fixation point. The effects of TMS were evaluated by calculating the percentage of error in amplitude (PEA) and latency of memory-guided saccades. The PEA was determined for the primary saccade (motor aspect) and the final eye position, i.e., after the end saccade (mnemonic aspect). Stimulation over the occipital cortex at the same time intervals served as control experiments. 2. After PPC stimulation, a significant increase in the PEA of the primary saccade and final eye position existed for contralateral saccades, compared with the PEA without stimulation, when stimulation was applied 260 ms after target presentation, but not at other time intervals. There was no significant effect on ipsilateral saccades. Latency was significantly increased bilaterally when stimulation was performed 2,100 ms after target presentation. 3. After prefrontal stimulation, a significant increase in the PEA of the primary saccade and final eye position existed for contralateral saccades, when stimulation was applied between 700 and 1,500 ms after target presentation, but not at other time intervals. There was no significant effect on ipsilateral saccades. Latency was not affected by prefrontal TMS at any stimulation times. 4. Occipital stimulation resulted in no significant effect on the PEA and latency of ipsilateral or contralateral saccades, in particular including the application at 260 ms after target presentation or during the memorization phase. 5. From these results it may be concluded that the observed effects of TMS on saccade accuracy were specific to the stimulated region and specific to the stimulation time. The PPC seems to be involved in the preparation of saccade amplitude, during the early phase of the paradigm, i.e., the sensorimotor processing period, whereas the DPFC could play a role during the later phase of the paradigm, i.e., the memorization period. Therefore in humans these results support the experimental findings suggesting that sensorimotor integration is controlled by the PPC and spatial memory by the DPFC.

In the awake condition, during voluntary contraction, one (n = 5) or two (n = 4) components of the ESCPs were elicited at the threshold stimulus intensity of the MEPs. As the stimulus intensity increased, an early response (n = 7) and multiple late components were recorded. The first component at high stimulus output (average 80%) preceded the small potentials elicited at threshold stimulus intensity. The latency of each component of the ESCPs during voluntary contraction was the same as that during the resting condition. In addition, the enhancement of amplitude of the ESCPs during voluntary contraction was not significant compared with that recorded at rest. During general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics, the first component of the ESCPs could be elicited at high stimulus intensity, but later components were markedly attenuated. In paired transcranial magnetic stimulation, the amplitude of this first potential following the test stimulus completely recovered within the 2 ms interstimulus interval. From these results, we hypothesized that the first component was generated non-synaptically (D-wave), but later components were generated transsynaptically (I-waves). Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and F-waves also were recorded following supramaximal ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist. Peripheral conduction time, which included synaptic delay in spinal motor neurons, was measured as follows (latency of CMAPs+ latency of F-wave + 1)/2 (ms). The central motor conduction time (CMCT) was measured by subtracting the peripheral conduction time from the onset latency of the MEP at high stimulus intensity in the awake state. During voluntary contraction, the calculated CMCT (4.9 +/- 1.0 ms) was the same as the onset latency of the second component of the ESCPs (I-wave, 4.3 +/- 0.2 ms) recorded from the C6-C6/7 epidural space. These results suggest that transcranial magnetic stimulation generates I-waves preferentially when the stimulus intensity was set at just the threshold level of the MEPs during voluntary contraction in the awake condition.

In three patients (i.e., 1 ASIA B; 2 ASIA C) the cortical modulation of H-reflex amplitudes yielded evidence of preserved corticospinal innervation that was not detectable by other MEP reinforcement procedures. These results introduce the cortical conditioning procedure as a sensitive means of detecting latent corticospinal and/or bulbospinal innervation in SCI patients consistent with the emerging neuropathological picture of preserved axonal integrity in descending motor tracts in the face of extensive functional loss.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "119 ( Pt 3)", "title": "The course of cortico-hypoglossal projections in the human brainstem.

The experimental design incorporated a previous observation that stimulation of afferents in the superficial radial nerve inhibits propriospinal-like neurones projecting to the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle. Surface EMG responses were recorded from the active ECR muscle after transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex. In random trials, single conditioning stimuli at twice perceptual threshold were given to the superficial radial nerve at the wrist at different times before a cortical shock. When the cortex was stimulated electrically, the conditioning stimulus suppressed the EMG responses when the interval between the shocks was 11 ms or more. This was about 3.5 ms longer than the minimum time calculated for a possible direct cutaneous effect on spinal motoneurones. The time course of suppression began earlier and was more complex during magnetic stimulation of the cortex. It is argued that this difference is due to the repetitive I waves generated by the magnetic shock. Whether electrical or magnetic stimulation was used, the first 1-3 ms of the EMG response was relatively unaffected by superficial radial nerve stimulation at any interstimulus interval, whereas clear suppression was seen in the later portion of the response. In contrast, if the EMG response in ECR was suppressed by a conditioning stimulus to the median nerve at the elbow, then all portions of the EMG response were inhibited including the first 1-3 ms. The median nerve effect is thought to be due to direct reciprocal inhibition of the extensor motoneurones. Thus sparing of the initial part of the cortically evoked response with superficial radial stimulation suggests that the latter type of inhibition occurs at a premotoneuronal level. The timing of the effect is compatible with the explanation that corticospinal excitation is produced in ECR motoneurones through both monosynaptic and disynaptic (including propriospinal premotoneuronal) pathways, with superficial radial nerve inhibition being exerted at the propriospinal level.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "The F wave disappears due to impaired excitability of motor neurons or proximal axons in inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "8761042", "authors": ["Yokota, T", "Inaba, A", "Yuki, N", "Ichikawa, T", "Tanaka, H", "Saito, Y", "Kanouchi, T"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The cortical silent period evoked by magnetic transcranial stimulation and the peripheral silent period were studied in healthy subjects after intravenous injection of diazepam, baclofen or thiopental.

In this study, six subjects with Parkinson's disease and six healthy control subjects performed a non-cued sequential finger movement task. At various times relative to movement, high-intensity single-pulse magnetic stimulation was delivered over the region of the SMA, with minimal current spread to primary motor areas.

Supplementary motor area stimulation had no effect when delivered during later stages of the movement or immediately prior to movement onset, and had no apparent effect on control subjects at any time. It is therefore suggested that the SMA is important in motor planning and preparatory processes, since SMA stimulation has no effect on movements in their later stages when planning may be complete, but may disrupt movements in their early stages, when preparation for later stages may still be in progress.

TMS applied to the hand area of the motor cortex was delivered during eight different phases of the task. There was a striking phase-related modulation in the amplitude of the short-latency EMG responses elicited by TMS in six arm and hand muscles. Although several mechanisms probably contribute to this modulation, one result of their operation is a potentially greater influence of the cortex during particular phases of the task. Evidence is produced that one factor contributing to this modulation is a phase-related change in corticospinal excitability. The results are consistent with a strong excitatory corticospinal drive throughout the reach to brachioradialis and anterior deltoid, which contribute to hand transport, and to the extrinsic hand muscles, which orientate the hand and fingertips. In contrast, the intrinsic hand muscles appear to receive their strongest cortical input as the digits close around and first touch the object. TMS just before contact delayed the isometric parallel increase in load and grip forces necessary to lift the object. The particularly strong EMG and behavioral effects seen at touch may reflect a powerful interaction, at the cortical level, between cutaneous inputs signalling contact with the object and the effects of TMS. Central interactions between tactile afferent input and TMS were tested by delivering TMS at different times relative to the application of an unexpected load to an object held between the fingertips. The largest responses occurred when TMS was applied 60-80 ms after load onset. THe enhanced corticospinal influence that this represents probably contributes to the powerful, short-latency boosting in grip force observed when the object was suddenly subjected to an external load. Recording of corticospinal cells in the primary motor cortex of the awake monkey suggests that the phasic modulation observed with TMS may reflect the phasic-tonic pattern of corticomotoneuronal cell discharge during the task.

Acute stimulation was performed with a stimulus intensity of 0.9 x Tm and 1.5 x Tm using a duration of the train of stimuli of five seconds. Chronic stimulation was performed with a duration of the train of stimuli of one and five seconds using a stimulus intensity of 1.8 x Tm, every day for 30 days. Time to onset of PTZ-induced clonic seizure was determined after the acute stimulation or the last stimulation in chronic RTMS. In the groups of rats receiving acute RTMS (0.9 and 1.5 x Tm) no seizures developed. No differences were observed in time to onset of clonic seizures after PTZ injection compared to control rats. In the group of rats receiving chronic RTMS some rats showed facial contractions, chewing or head movements during or immediately after the stimulations. None of the rats developed tonic or clonic seizures in relation to RTMS. Time to onset of PTZ clonic seizures was reduced in both groups receiving RTMS with a stimulus duration of one (P < 0.01) and five (P < 0.05) seconds compared to control rats. The results from this study suggest that acute suprathreshold stimulation with a stimulus frequency of 50 Hz does not affect the induction of clonic PTZ seizures, whereas chronic (daily) stimulations have a facilitatory effect. This indicates that chronic stimulation with RTMS may induce a kindling process in the rat. Chronic RTMS stimulation may therefore represent an interesting alternative non-invasively kindling model to chemical and electrical stimulations.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Locating the motor cortex on the MRI with transcranial magnetic stimulation and PET.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8817277", "authors": ["Wassermann, EM", "Wang, B", "Zeffiro, TA", "Sadato, N", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Toro, C", "Hallett, M"], "year": "1996", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "We examined the motor evoked potentials (MEP) of the forearm muscles following transcranial magnetic stimulation after the Go/No-go reaction-time hands movement in ten normal subjects.

In this study, relationships between stimulus intensity and MEP latency, amplitude, duration, and area of the hypothenar muscles were assessed in 12 right- and 14 left-handed subjects. Effects of handedness, coil orientation, intensity of stimulation, and intersubject variability on these relationships were analyzed. The intraindividual variability was analyzed as the standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV) of four trials. The mean response threshold was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) for preferential stimulation (32%) than for nonpreferential stimulation (45%). With increasing stimulus intensities, MEP amplitudes still increased at 100% intensity in some subjects while in others the stimulus response-relations saturated. MEP amplitudes at an intensity of 20% above threshold ranged between 6 and 100% of MEP amplitude at maximum intensity. Differences between dominant and non-dominant hands were not seen, regardless of handedness. The SD of latency, amplitude, duration, or area depended on stimulus intensity. The CV however, was influenced by the intensity of stimulation: The CV for amplitude decreased from 46% at threshold to 10% at higher intensities. The variability of the MEP amplitude is only related to stimulus intensity when it is expressed in relation to it but not when it is expressed in absolute terms. The stimulus-response relation offers a more extensive measure of cortical excitability than the use of thresholds alone for the measurement of cortical excitability. The question can be raised whether high intensities should be used for clinical testing rather than threshold-related intensities.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Asymmetry of silent period evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke patients.", "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "8673493", "authors": ["Braune, HJ", "Fritz, C"], "year": "", "journal": "Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "abstract": "Relatively pain-free excitation of both superficial and deep nerves in the assessment of nerve conduction velocity is the main advantage of magnetic stimulation over conventional electrical stimulation. General utility of this technique has often been called into question by a number of authors because of difficulties in obtaining supramaximal responses or in determining the exact site of impulse generation when stimulating a peripheral nerve distally. Meanwhile, magnetic stimulation of the cervical and lumbar roots has become a routine procedure for the assessment of peripheral conduction time and is combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in the assessment of central conduction time. Recent developments in magnetic coil and stimulator design have improved the focality of the stimulus, so that selective supramaximal stimuli can be delivered to commonly studied peripheral nerves in the upper and lower limbs, both at proximal and distal segments. Furthermore, the introduction of small figure-8-shaped coils enables safe diagnosis of chronic compression syndromes with exact assessment of conduction velocities over short distances of peripheral nerves. The ease of application of magnetic stimulation and the absence of pain for the patient make magnetic stimulation a particularly attractive method for also investigating patients with demyelinating polyneuropathies, and will certainly replace conventional electrical stimulation in the near future.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "The contribution of transcortical pathways to long-latency stretch and tactile reflexes in human hand muscles.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8673480", "authors": ["Macefield, VG", "Rothwell, JC", "Day, BL"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

It is well established that orientation of the magnetic coil plays an important role on the stimulation effects of the motor cortex. However, there has been a few study regarding the effect of magnetic coil orientation on the efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation. Therefore, in the present study, I carried out two experiments to clarify the relationship between the magnetic coil orientation and the stimulation effects of human peripheral nerve. First, median nerve was stimulated at the elbow and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of abductor pollicis brevis muscle were recorded in 8 subjects at 4 different directions of the induced current. Two eight-shaped coils, 10 cm and 3.5 cm in outer diameter, were used. Stimulus intensities of big and small coils were 850 V and 90%, respectively. Motor threshold was measured at 4 directions with the big coil by increasing stimulus intensity up to 850 V from 150 V at a step of 50 V. It was found that the amplitude of the CMAP was the greatest in outer direction (toward the radial side) using either the big coil or the small coil. There was no significant difference between the amplitude in outer direction and that of supramaximal electrical stimulation. Motor threshold was the lowest in outer direction. Then, I measured the induced current of the big and small coils in a tank filled with saline that mimicked the forearm. The induced currents by both big and small coils were the largest and the first spatial derivatives of the induced electric field were the greatest in outer direction. These results suggest that the orientation of the eight-shaped coil is important for peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation. The fact that the forearm is a restrictive volume conductor may result in the different effects of coil orientation on the excitement of the peripheral nerve.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Apomorphine can increase cutaneous inhibition of motor activity in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9365382", "authors": ["Clouston, PD", "Lim, CL", "Sue, C", "Morris, JG", "Yiannikas, C"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Area and depth penetration of transcranial stimulation methods such as transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) are poorly defined.

Tes induced contralateral finger contractions and in T2* weighted images a transient signal increase was observed in the area underlying the electrodes. Compared with the signal obtained during sequential finger movements, the area activated by TES was more localized, signal amplitude, was smaller and there was no post-stimulus undershoot.

Presynaptic inhibition of soleus muscle Ia afferent fibres, produced by stimulation of group I afferents in the common peroneal nerve, was assessed from changes in the H reflex at long conditioning intervals, in six normal subjects. 2. Stimulation of the ipsilateral sural nerve at the malleolus, just before stimulation of the common peroneal nerve at the head of the fibula, decreased the presynaptic inhibition. This effect was strongest during voluntary plantar flexion and weaker during dorsiflexion or at rest. 3. Stimulation of other cutaneous nerve branches serving the dorsum of the ipsilateral foot, and also the contralateral sural nerve, decreased presynaptic inhibition. Adequate stimulation of low threshold cutaneous mechanoreceptors by light brushing of both distal dorsal and plantar surfaces of the ipsilateral foot decreased presynaptic inhibition. 4. Stimulation of the ipsilateral plantar nerves increased presynaptic inhibition, but this action is attributed to activation of group I afferents from the intrinsic muscles of the foot. 5. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the lower limb area of the contralateral motor cortex decreased presynaptic inhibition. This effect was strongest during voluntary plantar flexion and weaker during dorsiflexion or at rest. 6. The actions of cutaneous and corticospinal pathways completely occluded each other. However, when both effects were adjusted to be liminal, a spatial facilitation between them was observed. 7. It is concluded that in man, as in the cat, cutaneous and corticospinal axons converge on interneurones that inhibit the machinery of presynaptic inhibition of group Ia afferents. These actions may be responsible for the modulation of presynaptic inhibition which has been observed to precede and accompany a wide range of human movements.", "pages": "448-62"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Corticospinal direct response to transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8648332", "authors": ["Fujiki, M", "Isono, M", "Hori, S", "Ueno, S"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a focal coil was used to map the cortical representation of a hand muscle in four healthy subjects.

The digitized heads were registered with the subjects' MRIs using the scalp contours. The coordinate transformations yielded by this process were used to map the stimulation positions and the perpendicular line into the MRIs. Brain areas imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-labeled water, activated by movement of the same muscle, were registered with the MRIs using the brain contours. In all cases, the magnetic stimulation lines encountered the surface of the brain at the anterior lip of the central sulcus and ran along the precentral gyrus a few millimeters anterior to the central sulcus, coming within 5-22 mm of all the PET activation maxima.
