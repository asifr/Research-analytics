These are reflections of a dysfunction in a distributed cortico-subcortical, bihemispheric network. Therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that altering this pathological state with techniques of brain stimulation may offer a therapeutic target. Besides repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, tonic stimulation with weak direct currents (tDCS) modulates cortical excitability for hours after the end of stimulation, thus, it is a promising non-invasive therapeutic option. Early studies from the 1960s suggested some efficacy of DC stimulation to reduce symptoms in depression, but mixed results and development of psychotropic drugs resulted in an early abandonment of this technique. In the last years tDCS protocols have been optimized. Application of the newly developed stimulation protocols in patients with major depression has shown promise in few pilot studies. Further studies are needed to identify the optimal parameters of stimulation and the clinical and patient characteristics that may condition response to tDCS.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "219", "title": "Treatment of depression with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): a review.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19348793", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Boggio, PS", "Fregni, F", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "The corpus callosum (CC) represents a key structure for hand motor development and is accessible to investigation by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

Recently, we showed that PMv interacts with M1 in a specific fashion, depending on the hand posture. However, the functional connectivity between PMv and M1 during the preparation of an actual grasp is still unknown. To address this issue, PMv-M1 interactions were tested while subjects were preparing to grasp different visible objects requiring either a precision grip or a whole hand grasp. A conditioning-test transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm was used: a test stimulus was applied over M1 either in isolation or after a conditioning stimulus delivered, at different delays, over the ipsilateral PMv. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded in the first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi muscles, which show highly differentiated activity according to grasp. While subjects prepared to grasp, delivering a conditioning PMv pulse 6 or 8msec before a test pulse over M1 strikingly facilitated MEPs in the specific muscles that were used in the upcoming grasp. This degree of facilitation correlated with the amount of muscle activity used later in the trial to grasp the objects. The present results demonstrate that, during grasp preparation, the PMv-M1 interactions are muscle-specific. PMv appears to process the object geometrical properties relevant for the upcoming grasp, and transmits this information to M1, which in turn generates a motor command appropriate for the grasp. We also reveal that the grasp-specific facilitation resulting from PMv-M1 interactions is differently related to the upcoming grasp muscle activity than is that from paired-pulse stimulation over M1, suggesting that these two TMS paradigms assess the excitability of cortico-cortical pathways devoted to the control of grasp at two different levels.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of major depression: insights from past and recent clinical studies.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15703391", "authors": ["Murphy, DN", "Boggio, P", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current opinion in psychiatry", "abstract": "The interaction between homologous muscle representations in the right and left primary motor cortex was studied using a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol known to evoke interhemispheric inhibition (IHI).

In professional musicians, enhanced adaptive plasticity is associated with one of the highest level of motor skill a human being can achieve and the amount of these changes is even dependent on the age at which instrumental playing was started. In addition, adaptive neuroplastic changes occur when nervous system try to repair itself thus compensating dysfunctions. However, when these adaptive phenomena are pushed to an extreme, they can produce a maladaptive sensorimotor reorganization that interferes with motor performance rather than improving it.

TMS and neuroimaging can also be separated in time (offline approach). A conditioning session of repetitive TMS (rTMS) may be used to induce rapid reorganization in functional brain networks. The temporospatial patterns of TMS-induced reorganization can be subsequently mapped by using neuroimaging methods. Alternatively, neuroimaging may be performed first to localize brain areas that are involved in a given task. The temporospatial information obtained by neuroimaging can be used to define the optimal site and time point of stimulation in a subsequent experiment in which TMS is used to probe the functional contribution of the stimulated area to a specific task. In this review, we first address some general methodologic issues that need to be taken into account when using TMS in the context of neuroimaging. We then discuss the use of specific brain mapping techniques in conjunction with TMS. We emphasize that the various neuroimaging techniques offer complementary information and have different methodologic strengths and weaknesses.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Effects of 10 Hz rTMS on the neural efficiency of working memory.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "7519144", "authors": ["Preston, G", "Anderson, E", "Silva, C", "Goldberg, T", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a novel antidepressant therapy shown to be effective and safe in pharmacotherapy-resistant major depression.

To evaluate these alternatives, we designed three tasks in which subjects maintained a specified contact force while their hand was moved by a robotic manipulandum. The prescribed contact force and hand motions were selected in each task to induce the subject to attain one of three goals: (1) exerting a regulated contact force, (2) tracking the motion of the manipulandum, and (3) attaining both force and motion goals concurrently. By comparing subjects' performances in these three tasks, we found that behavior was captured by the summed actions of two independent control systems: one applying the desired force, and the other guiding the hand along the predicted path of the manipulandum.

Objective tinnitus is either pulsatile synchronous with heartbeat or asynchronous. In the former, appropriate radiological testing should search for a vascular abnormality as well as other neurological diseases (intracranial hypertension, Arnold-Chiari malformation, vascular loops, etc.). Asynchronous objective tinnitus generally corresponds to muscular contractions that require specific management. The pathophysiology of subjective tinnitus is more complex, showing strong analogies with postamputation pain syndromes. After peripheral middle ear or inner ear damage, auditory deafferentation could result in hyperactivity and/or functional reorganization within central auditory and nonauditory structures. This could explain the persistence of tinnitus after total hearing amputation (e.g., translabyrinthine approach for vestibular schwannoma) and associated symptoms such as hyperacusis or anxiety and depression. This central model finds strong support in animal experiments and in functional neuroimagery (PET, fMRI, MEG). Since no etiologically based therapies are currently available, severe subjective tinnitus management only targets tinnitus tolerance with sound enrichment or cognitive behavior therapy. However, in the near future better knowledge of tinnitus pathophysiology and innovative therapeutic tools could emerge from neuromodulation techniques such as repeated transcranial magnetic or epidural electric stimulation.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Does TMS need functional imaging?", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11137667", "authors": ["Sack, AT"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "abstract": "Conceptual knowledge allows us to bring meaning to our world. Studies of semantic dementia (SD) patients and some functional neuroimaging studies indicate that the anterior temporal lobes, bilaterally, are a core neural substrate for the formation of conceptual representations. The majority of SD patients (who have circumscribed atrophy of the anterior temporal lobes) have better comprehension of concrete than abstract words. However, this finding remains controversial, as some individual SD patients have exhibited reverse imageability effects, i.e., relative preservation of abstract knowledge. This would imply that the anterior temporal lobes are particularly crucial for processing sensory aspects of semantic knowledge, which are an important part of concrete but not abstract concepts. To adjudicate on this debate, we used offline, low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt neural processing temporarily in the left or right temporal poles (TPs). We examined this effect using a synonym judgement task, comprising high, medium and low imageability items, which we have previously employed with a case-series of SD patients. The time required to make semantic decisions was slowed considerably, particularly for low imageability items, consistent with the pattern we observed in SD. These results confirm that both TPs make a critical contribution to semantic processing, even for abstract concepts that do not have strong sensory representations.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Influence of prefrontal target region on the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with medication-resistant depression: a [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and MRI study.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10680571", "authors": ["Paill\u00e8re Martinot, ML", "Galinowski, A", "Ringuenet, D", "Gallarda, T", "Lefaucheur, JP", "Bellivier, F", "Picq, C", "Brugui\u00e8re, P", "Mangin, JF", "Rivi\u00e8re, D", "Willer, JC", "Falissard, B", "Leboyer, M", "Oli\u00e9, JP", "Artiges, E", "Martinot, JL"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)", "abstract": "Periventricular leukomalacia is characterized by damage to the brain's white matter and impairments in motor function.

Therefore, adjunct interventions that can augment the response of the motor system to the behavioural training might be useful to enhance the therapy-induced recovery in neurological populations. In this context, noninvasive brain stimulation appears to be an interesting option as an add-on intervention to standard physical therapies.

The recruitment of motor cortical inhibition and facilitation was measured by varying the stimulus intensity (SI) of the first conditioning stimulus in a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm producing stimulus-response (S-R) curves of intracortical excitability. S-R curves were then compared with other commonly used TMS measures of cortical excitability [cortical silent period (CSP) and motor threshold (MT)]. In patients with IGE, inhibition occurred only at higher conditioning SIs compared to patients with focal epilepsy and controls. Recruitment of inhibition was unchanged in patients with focal epilepsy compared to controls. Recruitment of facilitation (ICF), CSP duration and MT, were not different between patients with FE or IGE or between patients and controls. These results suggest that the recruitment for motor cortical inhibition in patients with IGE is less effective. This may reflect a disturbed access to or an increased threshold of inhibitory neurons within the motor cortex. Impaired recruitment of inhibition might be a helpful parameter to access cortical excitability in newly diagnosed patients with generalized or focal epilepsy.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Stimulus-response profile during single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the primary motor cortex.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "8930851", "authors": ["Hanakawa, T", "Mima, T", "Matsumoto, R", "Abe, M", "Inouchi, M", "Urayama, S", "Anami, K", "Honda, M", "Fukuyama, H"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "An emerging theoretical perspective, largely based on neuroimaging studies, suggests that the pre-SMA is involved in planning cognitive aspects of motor behavior and language, such as linguistic and non-linguistic response selection. Neuroimaging studies, however, cannot indicate whether a brain region is equally important to all tasks in which it is activated. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the pre-SMA is an important component of response selection, using an interference technique. High frequency repetitive TMS (10 Hz) was used to interfere with the functioning of the pre-SMA during tasks requiring selection of words and oral gestures under different selection modes (forced, volitional) and attention levels (high attention, low attention). Results show that TMS applied to the pre-SMA interferes selectively with the volitional selection condition, resulting in longer RTs. The low- and high-attention forced selection conditions were unaffected by TMS, demonstrating that the pre-SMA is sensitive to selection mode but not attentional demands. TMS similarly affected the volitional selection of words and oral gestures, reflecting the response-independent nature of the pre-SMA contribution to response selection. The implications of these results are discussed.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "How symbolic gestures and words interact with each other.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9081617", "authors": ["Barbieri, F", "Buonocore, A", "Volta, RD", "Gentilucci, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain and language", "abstract": "Natural scenes generally include several possible objects that can be the target for a shift of gaze and attention. The oculomotor system may select a single target by boosting neural activation representing the target, and also by inhibiting neural activity associated with competing alternatives (distractors). We examine the role of the frontal eye field (FEF) in these processes through the effects of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the distractor-related modulation of saccade trajectories. Participants made voluntary saccades to peripheral locations specified by a central arrow-cue. On some trials, visual distractors appeared remote from the target location. The competing distractor produced a deviation of saccade trajectory, away from the distractor location. Single-pulse TMS stimulation of the right frontal eye field increased this distractor-related deviation compared that observed when stimulation was applied to a control site (vertex). The increase in distractor-related deviation of trajectory, following FEF stimulation, was observed for saccades made in both the left and right visual fields and could not be attributed to an effect of TMS on saccade latency. The enhanced distractor-related deviation following FEF stimulation could reflect increased inhibition of the competing distractor, or reduced salience of the endogenous saccade goal. The results are interpreted in light of neurophysiological evidence that the human FEF is involved in the dynamic interaction between competing stimuli for the selection of a candidate target.", "pages": "1"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Supramarginal gyrus involvement in visual word recognition.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "9055804", "authors": ["Stoeckel, C", "Gough, PM", "Watkins, KE", "Devlin, JT"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown promising results in treating Parkinson's disease (PD), but the best values for rTMS parameters are not established.
