However, here we propose a novel mechanism by which the non-linear properties of single neurons 'amplify' very small electric fields. Specifically, an amplified change in timing of action potential firing (DeltaT) is inversely proportional to the slope of depolarizing ramp stimulation and proportional to the amount of polarization (DeltaV) caused by the electric fields: DeltaT=DeltaV/(ramp slope). Thus, when responding to slow depolarizing synaptic input, small electric fields can have significant effects on spike timing. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were depolarized with injections of depolarizing current ramps approximating synaptic input. Simultaneously, neurons were polarized by either DC holding currents or extracellular uniform DC electrical fields and the resulting changes in spike timing quantified. Consistent with our hypothesis, the polarization induced by each method was found to affect firing time linearly with the amount of polarization, scaled (amplified) with the inverse of the injected ramp slope consistent with our hypothesis.", "pages": "4949-52"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Suppression of neural activity with high frequency stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17946913", "authors": ["Durand, DM", "Jensen, A", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to generate suppression of abnormal neural activity in patients with Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. High frequency stimulation is applied to the brain through depth electrodes in the range of 50 to 200 Hz. Yet the mechanisms underlying the suppression effect have not yet been elucidated. In order to study directly the effect of HFS in the brain, sinusoidal stimulation was applied in the in-vitro brain slice preparation. Sinusoidal stimulation was chosen in order to observe the activity during the stimulation by filtering the stimulation artifact. Sinusoidal stimulation at 50 Hz applied to the CA1 region of the hippocampus was observed to block epileptiform activity in three separate models of epilepsy induced by low-calcium, high potassium and picrotoxin (GABA A blocker). Stimulation applied to the alveus showed that activity in both the cell bodies (evoked potentials) and in the axons (compound action potentials) is suppressed. The frequency range of this effect is nearly identical to that of DBS with maximum suppression effect between 50 and 200 Hz. The effect could not be attributed to desynchronization or damage and was associated with increased extracellular potassium concentrations. These data provide new insights into the effects of HFS on neuronal elements and show that HFS can block axonal activity through non-synaptic mechanisms.", "pages": "4949-52"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Rational modulation of neuronal processing with applied electric fields.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17946911", "authors": ["Bikson, M", "Radman, T", "Datta, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Traditional approaches to electrical stimulation, using trains of supra-threshold pulses to trigger action potentials, may be replaced or augmented by using 'rational' sub-threshold stimulation protocols that incorporate knowledge of single neuron geometry, inhomogeneous tissue properties, and nervous system information coding. Sub-threshold stimulation, at intensities (well) below those sufficient to trigger action potentials, may none-the-less exert a profound effect on brain function through modulation of concomitant neuronal activity. For example, small DC fields may coherently polarize a network of neurons and thus modulate the simultaneous processing of afferent synaptic input as well as resulting changes in synaptic plasticity. Through 'activity-dependent plasticity', sub-threshold fields may allow specific targeting of pathological networks and are thus particularly suitable to overcome the poor anatomical focus of noninvasive (transcranial) electrical stimulation. Additional approaches to improve targeting in transcranial stimulation using novel electrode configurations are also introduced.", "pages": "4949-52"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Bio-heat transfer model of deep brain stimulation induced temperature changes.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17946574", "authors": ["Elwassif, MM", "Kong, Q", "Vazquez, M", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which the nonlinear properties of single neurons \"amplify\" the effect of small electric fields: when concurrent to suprathreshold synaptic input, small electric fields can have significant effects on spike timing. For low-frequency fields, our theory predicts a linear dependency of spike timing changes on field strength. For high-frequency fields (relative to the synaptic input), the theory predicts coherent firing, with mean firing phase and coherence each increasing monotonically with field strength. Importantly, in both cases, the effects of fields on spike timing are amplified with decreasing synaptic input slope and increased cell susceptibility (millivolt membrane polarization per field amplitude). We confirmed these predictions experimentally using CA1 hippocampal neurons in vitro exposed to static (direct current) and oscillating (alternating current) uniform electric fields. In addition, we develop a robust method to quantify cell susceptibility using spike timing. Our results provide a precise mechanism for a functional role of endogenous field oscillations (e.g., gamma) in brain function and introduce a framework for considering the effects of environmental fields and design of low-intensity therapeutic neurostimulation technologies.", "pages": "4949-52"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Model of the effect of extracellular fields on spike time coherence.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17271327", "authors": ["Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

It has been proposed that, particularly during the early part of a field burst, synchronised activity in small independent aggregates of neurons results in low amplitude irregular population spikes and subsequent fusion of aggregates generates high amplitude, regular discharging spikes. In the present experiments, we have tested the hypothesis that progression from aggregate formation to aggregate fusion requires a critical mass of participating neurons. We found that isolated CA1 segments >2 mm are still able to generate high amplitude, regular discharging population spikes, but when segment length is reduced to 1-2 mm, only 29% generate spikes with these characteristics; in the remainder, the field burst shows a DC shift+/-low amplitude irregular population spikes. No field bursts were seen in segments < 0.7 mm or in 50% of those 0.7-1 mm in length (in the remaining 50%, only the DC component of the field burst was present). Exposing 1-2 mm segments to hypo-osmolar perfusate induced a return of high amplitude rhythmic discharging population spikes in the field burst. We interpret these observations by indicating that progression from aggregate formation to aggregate fusion requires a critical neuronal mass and can be enhanced by reducing osmolarity of the perfusate.", "pages": "4949-52"}, {"volume": "141", "title": "Electrical stimulation of excitable tissue: design of efficacious and safe protocols.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15661300", "authors": ["Merrill, DR", "Bikson, M", "Jefferys, JG"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "The physical basis for electrical stimulation of excitable tissue, as used by electrophysiological researchers and clinicians in functional electrical stimulation, is presented with emphasis on the fundamental mechanisms of charge injection at the electrode/tissue interface.

Here we investigate the role of changes in tissue electrical resistivity in this process. We used the rat hippocampal slice, low-Ca(2+) model of epilepsy and measured changes in pyramidal layer extracellular resistance during the course of electrographic seizures. During each burst, population spike frequency decreased, whereas amplitude and spatial synchronization increased; after the main discharge, there could be brief secondary discharges that, in contrast with those in the primary discharge, started with high-amplitude population spikes. Mean resistivity increased from 1,231 Omega.cm immediately before the burst to a maximum of 1,507 Omega.cm during the burst. There was no significant increase during the first 0.5-1 s of the field burst, but resistance then increased (tau approximately 5 s), reaching its peak at the end of the burst, and then decayed slowly (tau approximately 10 s). In further experiments, we modulated the efficacy of electrical field effects by changing perfusate osmolarity. Reducing osmolarity by 40-70 mOsm increased preburst resistivity by 19%; it reduced minimum population spike frequency (x0.6-0.7) and increased both maximum population spike amplitude (x1.5-2.3) and spatial synchronization (x1.4-2.5, cross-correlation over 0.5 mm) during bursts. Increasing osmolarity by 20-40 mOsm had the opposite effects. These results suggest that, during each field burst, field effects between neurons gradually become more effective as cells swell, thereby modulating burst dynamics and facilitating the rapid synchronization of secondary discharges.", "pages": "4949-52"}]
