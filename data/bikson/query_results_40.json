Moreover, it is expected that lesioned brain tissue will influence current flow and should therefore be considered (and perhaps leveraged) in the design of individualized tDCS therapies for stroke. The current report demonstrates how different electrode configurations influence the flow of electrical current through brain tissue in a patient who responded positively to a tDCS treatment targeting aphasia. The patient, a 60-year-old man, sustained a left hemisphere ischemic stroke (lesion size = 87.42 mL) 64 months before his participation. In this study, we present results from the first high-resolution (1 mm(3)) model of tDCS in a brain with considerable stroke-related damage; the model was individualized for the patient who received anodal tDCS to his left frontal cortex with the reference cathode electrode placed on his right shoulder. We modeled the resulting brain current flow and also considered three additional reference electrode positions: right mastoid, right orbitofrontal cortex, and a \"mirror\" configuration with the anode over the undamaged right cortex. Our results demonstrate the profound effect of lesioned tissue on resulting current flow and the ability to modulate current pattern through the brain, including perilesional regions, through electrode montage design. The complexity of brain current flow modulation by detailed normal and pathologic anatomy suggest: (1) That computational models are critical for the rational interpretation and design of individualized tDCS stroke-therapy; and (2) These models must accurately reproduce head anatomy as shown here.", "pages": "430-1"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Individualized model predicts brain current flow during transcranial direct-current stimulation treatment in responsive stroke patient.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "21777878", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Baker, JM", "Bikson, M", "Fridriksson, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides a non-invasive tool to elicit neuromodulation by delivering current through electrodes placed on the scalp. The present clinical paradigm uses two relatively large electrodes to inject current through the head resulting in electric fields that are broadly distributed over large regions of the brain. In this paper, we present a method that uses multiple small electrodes (i.e. 1.2 cm diameter) and systematically optimize the applied currents to achieve effective and targeted stimulation while ensuring safety of stimulation. We found a fundamental trade-off between achievable intensity (at the target) and focality, and algorithms to optimize both measures are presented. When compared with large pad-electrodes (approximated here by a set of small electrodes covering 25 cm(2)), the proposed approach achieves electric fields which exhibit simultaneously greater focality (80% improvement) and higher target intensity (98% improvement) at cortical targets using the same total current applied. These improvements illustrate the previously unrecognized and non-trivial dependence of the optimal electrode configuration on the desired electric field orientation and the maximum total current (due to safety). Similarly, by exploiting idiosyncratic details of brain anatomy, the optimization approach significantly improves upon prior un-optimized approaches using small electrodes. The analysis also reveals the optimal use of conventional bipolar montages: maximally intense tangential fields are attained with the two electrodes placed at a considerable distance from the target along the direction of the desired field; when radial fields are desired, the maximum-intensity configuration consists of an electrode placed directly over the target with a distant return electrode. To summarize, if a target location and stimulation orientation can be defined by the clinician, then the proposed technique is superior in terms of both focality and intensity as compared to previous solutions and is thus expected to translate into improved patient safety and increased clinical efficacy.", "pages": "430-1"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Optimized multi-electrode stimulation increases focality and intensity at target.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Dmochowski, JP", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Su, Y", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that has been intensively investigated in the past decade as this method offers a non-invasive and safe alternative to change cortical excitability. The effects of one session of tDCS can last for several minutes, and its effects depend on polarity of stimulation, such as that cathodal stimulation induces a decrease in cortical excitability, and anodal stimulation induces an increase in cortical excitability that may last beyond the duration of stimulation. These effects have been explored in cognitive neuroscience and also clinically in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders--especially when applied over several consecutive sessions. One area that has been attracting attention of neuroscientists and clinicians is the use of tDCS for modulation of pain-related neural networks. Modulation of two main cortical areas in pain research has been explored: primary motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

For each electrode montage, clinical effects were correlated with predictions of induced cortical current flow using magnetic resonance imaging-derived finite element method head model. Thirty patients were randomized into 5 groups (Cathodal-M1 [primary motor cortex], Cathodal-SO [supra-orbital area], Anodal-M1, Anodal-SO, and Sham) to receive tDCS application (2 mA, 20 minutes) using an extracephalic montage. Pain was measured using a visual numerical scale (VNS), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and a body diagram (BD) evaluating pain area. There was significant pain reduction in cathodal-SO and anodal-SO groups indexed by VNS. For PPT there was a trend for a similar effect in anodal-SO group. Computer simulation indicated that the M1-extracephalic montage produced dominantly temporo-parietal current flow, consistent with lack of clinical effects with this montage. Conversely, the SO-extracephalic montage produced current flow across anterior prefrontal structures, thus supporting the observed analgesic effects. Our clinical and modeling findings suggest that electrode montage, considering both electrodes, is critical for the clinical effects of M1-tDCS as electric current needs to be induced in areas associated with the pain matrix.

Elucidating the processes by which small currents affect ongoing brain activity is of paramount importance for the rational design of noninvasive electrotherapeutic strategies and to determine the relevance of endogenous fields. We propose that in active neuronal networks, weak electrical fields induce small but coherent changes in the firing rate and timing of neuronal populations that can be magnified by dynamic network activity. Specifically, we show that carbachol-induced gamma oscillations (25-35 Hz) in rat hippocampal slices have an inherent rate-limiting dynamic and timing precision that govern susceptibility to low-frequency weak electric fields (<50 Hz; <10 V/m). This leads to a range of nonlinear responses, including the following: (1) asymmetric power modulation by DC fields resulting from balanced excitation and inhibition; (2) symmetric power modulation by lower frequency AC fields with a net-zero change in firing rate; and (3) half-harmonic oscillations for higher frequency AC fields resulting from increased spike timing precision. These underlying mechanisms were elucidated by slice experiments and a parsimonious computational network model of single-compartment spiking neurons responding to electric field stimulation with small incremental polarization. Intracellular recordings confirmed model predictions on neuronal timing and rate changes, as well as spike phase-entrainment resonance at 0.2 V/m. Finally, our data and mechanistic framework provide a functional role for endogenous electric fields, specifically illustrating that modulation of gamma oscillations during theta-modulated gamma activity can result from field effects alone.", "pages": "430-1"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Low-intensity electrical stimulation affects network dynamics by modulating population rate and spike timing.", "issue": "45", "pmid": "7320909", "authors": ["Reato, D", "Rahman, A", "Bikson, M", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Dehiscence or leakage after bowel anastomoses is associated with high morbidity and mortality.
