Small electric fields (</40/ mV mm(-1)), applied parallel to the somato-dendritic axis, induced polarization of CA1 pyramidal cells; the relationship between applied field and induced polarization was linear (0.12 +/- 0.05 mV per mV mm(-1) average sensitivity at the soma). The peak amplitude and time constant (15-70 ms) of membrane polarization varied along the axis of neurons with the maximal polarization observed at the tips of basal and apical dendrites. The polarization was biphasic in the mid-apical dendrites; there was a time-dependent shift in the polarity reversal site. DC fields altered the thresholds of action potentials evoked by orthodromic stimulation, and shifted their initiation site along the apical dendrites. Large electric fields could trigger neuronal firing and epileptiform activity, and induce long-term (>1 s) changes in neuronal excitability. Electric fields perpendicular to the apical-dendritic axis did not induce somatic polarization, but did modulate orthodromic responses, indicating an effect on afferents. These results demonstrate that DC fields can modulate neuronal excitability in a time-dependent manner, with no clear threshold, as a result of interactions between neuronal compartments, the non-linear properties of the cell membrane, and effects on afferents.", "pages": "175-90"}, {"volume": "90", "title": "Depolarization block of neurons during maintenance of electrographic seizures.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10077317", "authors": ["Bikson, M", "Hahn, PJ", "Fox, JE", "Jefferys, JG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Epileptic seizures are associated with neuronal hyperactivity. Here, however, we investigated whether continuous neuronal firing is necessary to maintain electrographic seizures. We studied a class of \"low-Ca2+\" ictal epileptiform bursts, induced in rat hippocampal slices, that are characterized by prolonged (2-15 s) interruptions in population spike generation. We found that, during these interruptions, neuronal firing was suppressed rather than desynchronized. Intracellular current injection, application of extracellular uniform electric fields, and antidromic stimulation showed that the source of action potential disruption was depolarization block. The duration of the extracellular potassium transients associated with each ictal burst was not affected by disruptions in neuronal firing. Application of phenytoin or veratridine indicated a critical role for the persistent sodium current in maintaining depolarization block.

We found that electrographic seizures, induced in vitro using the low-Ca(2+) model, start with high-frequency (>150 Hz) activity that then decreases in frequency while increasing in amplitude. Multichannel and unit recordings showed that the mechanism of this transition was the progressive formation of larger neuronal aggregates. Thus the apparent high-frequency activity, at seizure onset, can reflect the simultaneous recording of several slower firing aggregates. Aggregate formation rate can be accelerated by reducing osmolarity. Because synaptic transmission is blocked when extracellular Ca(2+) is reduced, nonsynaptic mechanisms (gap junctions, field effects) must be sufficient for aggregate formation and recruitment.", "pages": "175-90"}, {"volume": "84", "title": "Ionic mechanisms underlying spontaneous CA1 neuronal firing in Ca2+-free solution.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10899202", "authors": ["Shuai, J", "Bikson, M", "Hahn, PJ", "Lian, J", "Durand, DM"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "abstract": "Hippocampal CA1 neurons exposed to zero-[Ca(2+)] solutions can generate periodic spontaneous synchronized activity in the absence of synaptic function. Experiments using hippocampal slices showed that, after exposure to zero-[Ca(2+)](0) solution, CA1 pyramidal cells depolarized 5-10 mV and started firing spontaneous action potentials. Spontaneous single neuron activity appeared in singlets or was grouped into bursts of two or three action potentials. A 16-compartment, 23-variable cable model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron was developed to study mechanisms of spontaneous neuronal bursting in a calcium-free extracellular solution. In the model, five active currents (a fast sodium current, a persistent sodium current, an A-type transient potassium current, a delayed rectifier potassium current, and a muscarinic potassium current) are included in the somatic compartment. The model simulates the spontaneous bursting behavior of neurons in calcium-free solutions. The mechanisms underlying several aspects of bursting are studied, including the generation of triplet bursts, spike duration, burst termination, after-depolarization behavior, and the prolonged inactive period between bursts. We show that the small persistent sodium current can play a key role in spontaneous CA1 activity in zero-calcium solutions. In particular, it is necessary for the generation of an after-depolarizing potential and prolongs both individual bursts and the interburst interval.", "pages": "175-90"}, {"volume": "547", "title": "Local suppression of epileptiform activity by electrical stimulation in rat hippocampus in vitro.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Lian, J", "Bikson, M", "Sciortino, C", "Stacey, WC", "Durand, DM"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "High frequency electrical stimulation of deep brain structures (DBS) has been effective at controlling abnormal neuronal activity in Parkinson's patients and is now being applied for the treatment of pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS are unknown. In particular, the effect of the electrical stimulation on neuronal firing remains poorly understood. Previous reports have showed that uniform electric fields with both AC (continuous sinusoidal) or DC waveforms could suppress epileptiform activity in vitro. In the present study, we tested the effects of monopolar electrode stimulation and low-duty cycle AC stimulation protocols, which more closely approximate those used clinically, on three in vitro epilepsy models. Continuous sinusoidal stimulation, 50 % duty-cycle sinusoidal stimulation, and low (1.68 %) duty-cycle pulsed stimulation (120 micros, 140 Hz) could completely suppress spontaneous low-Ca2+ epileptiform activity with average thresholds of 71.11 +/- 26.16 microA, 93.33 +/- 12.58 microA and 300 +/- 100 microA, respectively. Continuous sinusoidal stimulation could also completely suppress picrotoxin- and high-K+-induced epileptiform activity with either uniform or localized fields. The suppression generated by the monopolar electrode was localized to a region surrounding the stimulation electrode. Potassium concentration and transmembrane potential recordings showed that AC stimulation was associated with an increase in extracellular potassium concentration and neuronal depolarization block; AC stimulation efficacy was not orientation-selective. In contrast, DC stimulation blocked activity by membrane hyperpolarization and was orientation-selective, but had a lower threshold for suppression.", "pages": "175-90"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Conditions sufficient for nonsynaptic epileptogenesis in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11067578", "authors": ["Bikson, M", "Baraban, SC", "Durand, DM"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Nonsynaptic mechanisms exert a powerful influence on seizure threshold. It is well-established that nonsynaptic epileptiform activity can be induced in hippocampal slices by reducing extracellular Ca(2+) concentration. We show here that nonsynaptic epileptiform activity can be readily induced in vitro in normal (2 mM) Ca(2+) levels. Those conditions sufficient for nonsynaptic epileptogenesis in the CA1 region were determined by pharmacologically mimicking the effects of Ca(2+) reduction in normal Ca(2+) levels. Increasing neuronal excitability, by removing extracellular Mg(2+) and increasing extracellular K(+) (6-15 mM), induced epileptiform activity that was suppressed by postsynaptic receptor antagonists [D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, picrotoxin, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione] and was therefore synaptic in nature. Similarly, epileptiform activity induced when neuronal excitability was increased in the presence of K(Ca) antagonists (verruculogen, charybdotoxin, norepinephrine, tetraethylammonium salt, and Ba(2+)) was found to be synaptic in nature. Decreases in osmolarity also failed to induce nonsynaptic epileptiform activity in the CA1 region. However, increasing neuronal excitability (by removing extracellular Mg(2+) and increasing extracellular K(+)) in the presence of Cd(2+), a nonselective Ca(2+) channel antagonist, or veratridine, a persistent sodium conductance enhancer, induced spontaneous nonsynaptic epileptiform activity in vitro. Both novel models were characterized using intracellular and ion-selective electrodes. The results of this study suggest that reducing extracellular Ca(2+) facilitates bursting by increasing neuronal excitability and inhibiting Ca(2+) influx, which might, in turn, enhance a persistent sodium conductance. Furthermore, these data show that nonsynaptic mechanisms can contribute to epileptiform activity in normal Ca(2+) levels.", "pages": "175-90"}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "11179402", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "11252771", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "11359523", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "11516410", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}]
