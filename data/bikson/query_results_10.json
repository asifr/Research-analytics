Although increased/decreased excitability under the anode/cathode electrode is nominally associated with membrane depolarization/hyperpolarization, which cellular compartments (somas, dendrites, axons and their terminals) mediate changes in cortical excitability remains unaddressed. Here we consider the acute effects of DCS on excitatory synaptic efficacy. Using multi-scale computational models and rat cortical brain slices, we show the following. (1) Typical tDCS montages produce predominantly tangential (relative to the cortical surface) direction currents (4-12 times radial direction currents), even directly under electrodes. (2) Radial current flow (parallel to the somatodendritic axis) modulates synaptic efficacy consistent with somatic polarization, with depolarization facilitating synaptic efficacy. (3) Tangential current flow (perpendicular to the somatodendritic axis) modulates synaptic efficacy acutely (during stimulation) in an afferent pathway-specific manner that is consistent with terminal polarization, with hyperpolarization facilitating synaptic efficacy. (4) Maximal polarization during uniform DCS is expected at distal (the branch length is more than three times the membrane length constant) synaptic terminals, independent of and two-three times more susceptible than pyramidal neuron somas. We conclude that during acute DCS the cellular targets responsible for modulation of synaptic efficacy are concurrently somata and axon terminals, with the direction of cortical current flow determining the relative influence.", "pages": "036018"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Brain stimulation modulates the autonomic nervous system, rating of perceived exertion and performance during maximal exercise.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17360926", "authors": ["Okano, AH", "Fontes, EB", "Montenegro, RA", "Farinatti, PD", "Cyrino, ES", "Li, LM", "Bikson, M", "Noakes, TD"], "year": "2013", "journal": "British journal of sports medicine", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being investigated as an adjunctive technique to behavioral rehabilitation treatment after stroke. The conventional \"dosage\", consisting of a large (25 cm(2)) anode over the target with the cathode over the contralateral hemisphere, has been previously shown to yield broadly distributed electric fields whose intensities at the target region are less than maximal. Here, we report the results of a systematic targeting procedure with small \"high-definition\" electrodes that was used in preparation for a pilot study on 8 stroke patients with chronic aphasia. We employ functional and anatomical magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI/MRI) to define a target and optimize (with respect to the electric field magnitude at the target) the electrode configuration, respectively, and demonstrate that electric field strengths in targeted cortex can be substantially increased (63%) over the conventional approach. The optimal montage exhibits significant variation across subjects as well as when perturbing the target location within a subject. However, for each displacement of the target co-ordinates, the algorithm is able to determine a montage which delivers a consistent amount of current to that location. These results demonstrate that MRI-based models of current flow yield maximal stimulation of target structures, and as such, may aid in reliably assessing the efficacy of tDCS in neuro-rehabilitation.", "pages": "036018"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Focal modulation of the primary motor cortex in fibromyalgia using 4\u00d71-ring high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS): immediate and delayed analgesic effects of cathodal and anodal stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "18003828", "authors": ["Villamar, MF", "Wivatvongvana, P", "Patumanond, J", "Bikson, M", "Truong, DQ", "Datta, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society", "abstract": "The sleeping brain exhibits characteristic slow-wave activity which decays over the course of the night. This decay is thought to result from homeostatic synaptic downscaling. Transcranial electrical stimulation can entrain slow-wave oscillations (SWO) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG). A computational model of the underlying mechanism predicts that firing rates are predominantly increased during stimulation. Assuming that synaptic homeostasis is driven by average firing rates, we expected an acceleration of synaptic downscaling during stimulation, which is compensated by a reduced drive after stimulation. We show that 25 minutes of transcranial electrical stimulation, as predicted, reduced the decay of SWO in the remainder of the night. Anatomically accurate simulations of the field intensities on human cortex precisely matched the effect size in different EEG electrodes.

Evidence shows that the ANS and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) regulate exercise performance. Non-invasive brain stimulation can modulate the cortical area directly beneath the electrode related to ANS and RPE, but it could also affect subcortical areas by connection within the cortico-cortical neural networks. This study evaluated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the TC on the ANS, RPE and performance during a maximal dynamic exercise. METHODS: Ten trained cyclists participated in this study (33\u00b19 years; 171.5\u00b15.8 cm; 72.8\u00b19.5 kg; 10-11 training years). After 20-min of receiving either anodal tDCS applied over the left TC (T3) or sham stimulation, subjects completed a maximal incremental cycling exercise test. RPE, heart rate (HR) and R-R intervals (as a measure of ANS function) were recorded continuously throughout the tests. Peak power output (PPO) was recorded at the end of the tests. RESULTS: With anodal tDCS, PPO improved by \u223c4% (anodal tDCS: 313.2\u00b129.9 vs 301.0\u00b119.8 watts: sham tDCS; p=0.043), parasympathetic vagal withdrawal was delayed (anodal tDCS: 147.5\u00b153.3 vs 125.0\u00b135.4 watts: sham tDCS; p=0.041) and HR was reduced at submaximal workloads. RPE also increased more slowly during exercise following anodal tDCS application, but maximal RPE and HR values were not affected by cortical stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that non-invasive brain stimulation over the TC modulates the ANS activity and the sensory perception of effort and exercise performance, indicating that the brain plays a crucial role in the exercise performance regulation.", "pages": "036018"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Finite Element study of skin and fat delineation in an obese subject for transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18246974", "authors": ["Truong, DQ", "Magerowski, G", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Alonso-Alonso, M", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Given previous evidence supporting analgesic properties of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in this condition, this study examined the effects of a novel, more focal method of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), using the 4\u00d71-ring configuration of high-definition (HD)-tDCS, on overall perceived pain in fibromyalgia patients. In this patient- and assessor-blind, sham-controlled, crossover trial, 18 patients were randomized to undergo single 20-minute sessions of anodal, cathodal, and sham HD-tDCS at 2.0 mA in a counterbalanced fashion. The center electrode was positioned over the left primary motor cortex. Pain scales and sensory testing were assessed before and after each intervention. A finite element method brain model was generated to predict electric field distribution. We found that both active stimulation conditions led to significant reduction in overall perceived pain as compared to sham. This effect occurred immediately after cathodal HD-tDCS and was evident for both anodal and cathodal HD-tDCS 30 minutes after stimulation. Furthermore, active anodal stimulation induced a significant bilateral increase in mechanical detection thresholds. These interventions proved well tolerated in our patient population.", "pages": "036018"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "On the role of electric field orientation in optimal design of transcranial current stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18292226", "authors": ["Dmochowski, JP", "Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Richardson, J", "Fridriksson, J", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...
