One perceived hurdle is the presence of skull defects or skull plates in these patients that would hypothetically alter the intensity and location of current flow through the brain. We aimed to model tDCS using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived finite element head model with several conceptualized skull injuries. Cortical electric field (current density) peak intensities and distributions were compared with the healthy (skull intact) case. The factors of electrode position (C3-supraorbital or O1-supraorbital), electrode size skull defect size, skull defect state (acute and chronic) or skull plate (titanium and acrylic) were analyzed. If and how electric current through the brain was modulated by defects was found to depend on a specific combination of factors. For example, the condition that led to largest increase in peak cortical electric field was when one electrode was placed directly over a moderate sized skull defect. In contrast, small defects midway between electrodes did not significantly change cortical currents. As the conductivity of large skull defects/plates was increased (chronic to acute to titanium), current was shunted away from directly underlying cortex and concentrated in cortex underlying the defect perimeter. The predictions of this study are the first step to assess safety of transcranial electrical therapy in subjects with skull injuries and skull plates.", "pages": "1268-78"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Role of cortical cell type and morphology in subthreshold and suprathreshold uniform electric field stimulation in vitro.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "15753425", "authors": ["Radman, T", "Ramos, RL", "Brumberg, JC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "The neocortex is the most common target of subdural electrotherapy and noninvasive brain stimulation modalities, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial current simulation (TCS).

The proliferation of this therapy has been accompanied by isolated reports regarding concern about their safety namely skin irritation. The potential cause of skin irritation has sometimes been attributed to increased scalp temperature during stimulation. We have developed novel technology for tDCS that improves spatial focality at the cost of increased stimulation electrode current density; high density tDCS (HD-tDCS). The goal of this paper was to provide information on the thermal effects of tDCS using a MRI-derived finite element human head model. The tissue temperature increases of tDCS using conventional rectangular-pad (7 x 5 cm(2)) and HD-tDCS using the ring (4 x 1) electrode configurations were compared using a bio-heat model.

Its attractions are temporal and spatial specificity of action, flexibility of waveform parameters and timing, and the perception that its effects are reversible unlike resective surgery. However, despite significant advances in our understanding of mechanisms of neural electrical stimulation, clinical electrotherapy for seizures relies heavily on empirical tuning of parameters and protocols. We highlight concurrent treatment goals with potentially conflicting design constraints that must be resolved when formulating rational strategies for epilepsy electrotherapy, namely, seizure reduction versus cognitive impairment, stimulation efficacy versus tissue safety, and mechanistic insight versus clinical pragmatism. First, treatment markers, objectives, and metrics relevant to electrical stimulation for epilepsy are discussed from a clinical perspective.

A range of electrotherapy paradigms have been investigated, but no consistent method has been indicated for reporting reproducible stimulation \"dosage.\" Anecdotal reports, case studies, and limited clinical trials with small numbers suggest that tDCS may be effective in treating some patients with depression, but methods for selecting the optimal stimulation parameters (\"dosage\") are not clear, and there is no conclusive indication that tDCS is an effective treatment for depression. Larger, controlled studies are necessary to determine its safety and efficacy in a clinical setting. If tDCS can be established as an effective treatment for depression, it would represent a particularly attractive electrotherapy option, as it is a relatively benign and affordable treatment modality. An accurate system for describing reproducible treatment parameters is essential so that further studies can yield evidence-based guidelines for the clinical use of transcranial current stimulation. Development of appropriate parameters requires a biophysical understanding of how electrotherapy affects brain function and should include different paradigms for different clinical applications. As with any dosage guidelines, such a system does not supersede physician judgment on safety.", "pages": "1268-78"}]
