In addition to somatic polarization, subthreshold membrane polarization of axon compartments can play a significant role in modulating synaptic efficacy. The aim of this study is to provide an estimation of axon terminal polarization in a weak uniform subthreshold electric field. Simulations based on 3D morphology reconstructions and simplified models indicate that for axons having long final branches compared to the local space constant (L>4\u03bb) the terminal polarization converges to E\u03bb for electric fields oriented in the same direction as the branch. In particular we determined how and when analytical approximations could be extended to real cases when considering maximal potential polarization during weak DC stimulation.", "pages": "4575-8"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Electrode assembly design for transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: a FEM modeling study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23366036", "authors": ["Kronberg, G", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Despite accelerating progress in transcranial Direct Current Stimulation clinical and cognitive research, there remains remarkably little consistency in the control of electrode design and preparation. Electrode assembly design determines skin sensation and failure at the electrode can lead to skin burns. Though tDCS is generally well tolerated, the desire for rigor in electrode design is motivated by applications in increasingly diverse environments and populations. Generally the tDCS electrode assembly consists of a flat rubber or metal electrode and a saline/water saturated sponge. Here we show using FEM simulations, that each of these factors should be controlled to regulate current flow density across the skin: 1) sponge thickness 2) solution salinity 3) electrode size, 4) electrode placement in the sponge (including surface or pocket configuration) 5) control of excess fluid at the skin surface 6) use of rivets. Two general patterns of current distribution emerge as a result of integrated design: edge concentration or center concentration. Poor control over any of these electrode assembly parameters will result in unpredictable current density at the skin during tDCS.", "pages": "4575-8"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in pediatric brain: a computational modeling study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23366028", "authors": ["Minhas, P", "Bikson, M", "Woods, AJ", "Rosen, AR", "Kessler, SK"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation which uses weak electric currents applied on the scalp to modulate activity of underlying brain tissue. In addition to being used as a tool for cognitive neuroscience investigations, tDCS has generated considerable interest for use as a therapeutic modality for neurologic disorders. Though the safety and tolerability of tDCS in adults is well-established, there is little information on the safety of tDCS in children. Because there are differences between children and adults in several key parameters (such as skull thickness and cerebrospinal fluid volume) which affect current flow through the brain, special consideration should be given to the stimulation parameters which are used in a pediatric study population. In this study we present cortical electrical field maps at different stimulation intensities and electrode configurations using a high-resolution-MRI derived finite element model of a typically developing, anatomically normal 12 year old child. The peak electrical fields for a given stimulus intensity in the adolescent brain were twice as high as in the adult brain for conventional tDCS and nearly four times as high for a 4X1 High-Definition tDCS electrode configuration. These data suggest that acceptable tDCS stimulation parameters may be different in children compared to adults, and that further modeling studies are needed to help guide decisions about applied current intensity.", "pages": "4575-8"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "A pilot study on effects of 4\u00d71 high-definition tDCS on motor cortex excitability.", "issue": "", "pmid": "20435146", "authors": ["Caparelli-Daquer, EM", "Zimmermann, TJ", "Mooshagian, E", "Parra, LC", "Rice, JK", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Here we provide the first evidence of a change in cortical excitability after HD-tDCS of the motor cortex, using TMS motor evoked potential (MEP) as the measure of excitability. Stimulation for 20 minutes at 1 mA with an anode centered over the hand area of the motor cortex and four surrounding return electrodes (anodal 4\u00d71 montage) produced a significant increase in MEP amplitude and variability after stimulation, compared to sham stimulation. Stimulation was well tolerated by all subjects with adverse effects limited to transient sensation under the electrodes. A high-resolution computational model confirmed predictions of increased focality using the 4\u00d71 HD tDCS montage compared to conventional tDCS. Simulations also indicated that variability in placement of the center electrode relative to the location of the target (central sulcus) could account for increasing variability.

However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp. The direction of change relative to non-stimulation reversed with tDCS stimulation polarity. For tACS there was no net effect of the MRI signal. High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation. The optimization of current measurement and artifact correction techniques, including consideration of the underlying physics, remains to be addressed.", "pages": "4575-8"}]
