In the present study, we demonstrate that a new technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can interact with ongoing rhythmic activities in the visual cortex in a frequency-specific fashion and induce visual experiences (phosphenes). We delivered an oscillatory current over the occipital cortex with tACS. In order to observe interactions with ongoing cortical rhythms, we compared the effects of delivering tACS under conditions of light (\"Light\" condition) or darkness (\"Dark\" condition). Stimulation over the occipital cortex induced perception of continuously flickering light most effectively when the beta frequency range was applied in an illuminated room, whereas the most effective stimulation frequency shifted to the alpha frequency range during testing in darkness. Stimulation with theta or gamma frequencies did not produce any visual phenomena. The shift of the effective stimulation frequency indicates that the frequency dependency is caused by interactions with ongoing oscillatory activity in the stimulated cortex. Our results suggest that tACS can be used as a noninvasive tool for establishing a causal link between rhythmic cortical activities and their functions.", "pages": "2-13"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Comparatively weak after-effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on cortical excitability in humans.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "20633376", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Boros, K", "Poreisz, C", "Chaieb, L", "Terney, D", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Interference with brain rhythms by noninvasive transcranial stimulation that uses weak transcranial alternating current may reveal itself to be a new tool for investigating cortical mechanisms currently unresolved.

Acceptance of TES into clinical practice is hampered by lack of controlled clinical trials and inconclusive animal data regarding the TES antinociceptive action. This inconclusive data may be explained, in part, by failure in rat experiments to simulate the variables used in humans when TES electrodes are positioned on the skin. In this study we validated the TES antinociceptive effect in a novel animal model of cutaneously administered TES, when the stimulating conditions mimic the ones used in clinical practice. The antinociceptive effect was assessed by measuring nociceptive thresholds in the tail-flick and hot-plate latency tests in awake, unrestrained male rats. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and mixed-effects population modeling. The administration of TES at 2.25 mA produced an almost immediate, sustained, frequency-dependent (40-60 Hz) antinociceptive effect, reaching approximately 50% of the maximal possible value. We conclude that an antinociceptive effect of cutaneously administered TES can be demonstrated in the rat. Some characteristics of the effect suggest an important role of the sensory nerves of the rat's scalp in mediating the TES antinociceptive response.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "Transcranial electrostimulation produces a significant, frequency-dependent antinociceptive effect that may be mediated by cutaneous nerves of the scalp.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "Prior research on the use of transcranial neuroelectric stimulation suggested that the application of low-amperage, low-frequency alternating current via surface electrodes placed in the mastoid region could relieve the physiological signs and subjective symptoms of withdrawal and craving during opiate detoxification. These effects were reported without gradual tapering of the opiate or the addition of other medications. To test the efficacy of one particular form of neuroelectric therapy (NET), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted comparing active NET and placebo NET in the treatment of withdrawal and stabilization of 18 opiate-dependent and 25 cocaine-dependent subjects. Scores on scales for measuring substance withdrawal and craving for each abused substance, as well as the multiple dimensions of mood, were compared for degree of difference across the 10 days of treatment. There was an overall completion rate of 88%, with both cocaine and opiate groups reporting a comfortable detoxification and substantial improvement over the course of a 12-day hospitalization. There was no significant difference between the active or placebo groups, suggesting that placebo was as effective as active NET in reducing drug withdrawal or craving during cocaine and opiate detoxification. However, all placebo patients received 0.2 mA of current, which may have provided a degree of active current. Suggestions are offered for future research.", "pages": ""}]
