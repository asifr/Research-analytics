Rather than a combined picture being perceived, each monocular image competes for perceptual dominance, becoming visible for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Stable visual input thus leads to alternations in conscious perception, dissociating stimulation from awareness. This makes rivalry particularly useful for elucidating the neural processes underlying consciousness [1]. Retinotopic visual cortex [2] and lateral geniculate nucleus [3] activity are modulated by such alternating perception, implying an early locus for rivaling neural representations. However, higher cortical regions, including right superior parietal cortex, exhibit activity that is time-locked to perceptual transitions [4]. Though this implies the involvement of top-down processes in rivalry, the correlational nature of neuroimaging precludes the attribution of a causal role to such activity, which may instead simply reflect orientating attention to the transition. Here we distinguish these two hypotheses by showing that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right superior parietal cortex shortened binocular rivalry dominance durations. This suggests that right parietal cortex maintains the current perceptual state during rivalry.", "pages": "R799-800"}, {"volume": "479", "title": "Inhibition of motor cortex excitability with 15Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).", "issue": "3", "pmid": "21300270", "authors": ["Zaghi, S", "de Freitas Rezende, L", "de Oliveira, LM", "El-Nazer, R", "Menning, S", "Tadini, L", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "There remains a lack of solid evidence showing whether transcranial stimulation with weak alternating current (transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS) can in fact induce significant neurophysiological effects. Previously, a study in which tACS was applied for 2 and 5min with current density=0.16-0.25A/m(2) was unable to show robust effects on cortical excitability. Here we applied tACS at a significantly higher current density (0.80A/m(2)) for a considerably longer duration (20min) and were indeed able to demonstrate measurable changes to cortical excitability. Our results show that active 15Hz tACS of the motor cortex (electrodes placed at C3 and C4) significantly diminished the amplitude of motor evoked potentials and decreased intracortical facilitation (ICF) as compared to baseline and sham stimulation. In addition, we show that our method of sham tACS is a reliable control condition. These results support the notion that AC stimulation with weak currents can induce significant changes in brain excitability; in this case, 15Hz tACS led to a pattern of inhibition of cortical excitability. We propose that tACS may have a dampening effect on cortical networks and perhaps interfere with the temporal and spatial summation of weak subthreshold electric potentials.", "pages": "R799-800"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of transcranial electrostimulation with combined direct and alternating current in healthy volunteers.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "20553804", "authors": ["Nekhendzy, V", "Lemmens, HJ", "Tingle, M", "Nekhendzy, M", "Angst, MS"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "abstract": "Transcranial electrostimulation (TES) has been reported to produce clinically significant analgesia, but randomized and double-blind studies are lacking.
