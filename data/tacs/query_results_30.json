In \"quiescent\" human sensorimotor regions, the main detectable oscillatory activity peaks at \u223c20 Hz, and partly contributes to determine the state of corticospinal excitability. Here, we showed that the transcranial application of an imperceptible, short-lasting (90 s) electric field oscillating at a physiological range increases corticospinal excitability online, with well defined frequency dependence and regional specificity. Indeed, the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by navigated single-pulse TMS over the motor cortex significantly increased only during the local application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 20 Hz (\u03b2 range). Other tACS frequencies (5, 10, and 40 Hz) applied on the motor cortex did not impact MEPs' size. Moreover, tACS applied on a control site (parietal cortex) and on a peripheral site (ulnar nerve) also failed to modulate MEPs. These results help clarifying the functional significance of the 20 Hz idling \u03b2 rhythm of sensorimotor regions and suggest potential clinical applications of this approach.", "pages": "12165-70"}, {"volume": "193", "title": "Slow oscillations orchestrating fast oscillations and memory consolidation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22238075", "authors": ["M\u00f6lle, M", "Born, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "Slow-wave sleep (SWS) facilitates the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. Based on the standard two-stage memory model, we propose that memory consolidation during SWS represents a process of system consolidation which is orchestrated by the neocortical <1Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) slow oscillation and involves the reactivation of newly encoded representations and their subsequent redistribution from temporary hippocampal to neocortical long-term storage sites. Indeed, experimental induction of slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep by slowly alternating transcranial current stimulation distinctly improves consolidation of declarative memory. The slow oscillations temporally group neuronal activity into up-states of strongly enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. In a feed-forward efferent action, this grouping is induced not only in the neocortex but also in other structures relevant to consolidation, namely the thalamus generating 10-15Hz spindles, and the hippocampus generating sharp wave-ripples, with the latter well known to accompany a replay of newly encoded memories taking place in hippocampal circuitries. The feed-forward synchronizing effect of the slow oscillation enables the formation of spindle-ripple events where ripples and accompanying reactivated hippocampal memory information become nested into the single troughs of spindles. Spindle-ripple events thus enable reactivated memory-related hippocampal information to be fed back to neocortical networks in the excitable slow oscillation up-state where they can induce enduring plastic synaptic changes underlying the effective formation of long-term memories.", "pages": "12165-70"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES - tDCS; tRNS, tACS) methods.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "21854958", "authors": ["Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation", "abstract": "Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with a homogenous DC field at intensities of around 1\u00a0mA induces long-lasting changes in the brain. tDCS can be used to manipulate brain excitability via membrane polarisation: cathodal stimulation hyperpolarises, while anodal stimulation depolarises the resting membrane potential, whereby the induced after-effects depend on polarity, duration and intensity of the stimulation. A variety of other parameters influence tDCS effects; co-application of neuropharmacologically active drugs may most impressively prolong or even reverse stimulation effects.

However, their functional roles are still the subject of debate. One-way to probe the roles of oscillatory neural activities is to deliver alternating current to the cortex at biologically relevant frequencies and examine whether such stimulation influences perception and cognition. In this study, we tested whether transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) could elicit tactile sensations in humans in a frequency-dependent manner. We tested the effectiveness of tACS over SI at frequency bands ranging from 2 to 70 Hz. Our results show that stimulation in alpha (10-14 Hz) and high gamma (52-70 Hz) frequency range produces a tactile sensation in the contralateral hand. A weaker effect was also observed for beta (16-20 Hz) stimulation. These findings highlight the frequency dependency of effective tACS over SI with the effective frequencies corresponding to those observed in previous electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography studies of tactile perception. Our present study suggests that tACS could be used as a powerful online stimulation technique to reveal the causal roles of oscillatory brain activities.", "pages": "12165-70"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on human regional cerebral blood flow.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21713181", "authors": ["Zheng, X", "Alsop, DC", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can up- and down-regulate cortical excitability depending on current direction, however our abilities to measure brain-tissue effects of the stimulation and its after-effects have been limited so far. We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1%) in rCBF during stimulation, which returned to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive after-effects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area. Our results indicate that ASL may be an excellent tool to investigate the effects of tDCS and its stimulation parameters on brain activity.", "pages": "12165-70"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation in the low kHz range increases motor cortex excitability.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "6163614", "authors": ["Chaieb, L", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "External transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation techniques allow for the fast induction of sustained and measurable changes in cortical excitability.
