These techniques are based on the delivery of weak currents through the scalp (with electrode current intensity to area ratios of about 0.3-5 A/m2) at low frequencies (typically < 1 kHz) resulting in weak electric fields in the brain (with amplitudes of about 0.2-2 V/m). Here we review the biophysics and simulation of noninvasive, current-controlled generation of electric fields in the human brain and the models for the interaction of these electric fields with neurons, including a survey of in vitro and in vivo related studies. Finally, we outline directions for future fundamental and technological research.", "pages": "175"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Transcranial current brain stimulation (tCS): models and technologies.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "22949089", "authors": ["Ruffini, G", "Wendling, F", "Merlet, I", "Molaee-Ardekani, B", "Mekonnen, A", "Salvador, R", "Soria-Frisch, A", "Grau, C", "Dunne, S", "Miranda, PC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a promising therapeutic tool for a range of neurological diseases. Understanding how the small currents used in tES spread across the scalp and penetrate the brain will be important for the rational design of tES therapies. Alternating currents applied transcranially above visual cortex induce the perception of flashes of light (phosphenes). This makes the visual system a useful model to study tES. One hypothesis is that tES generates phosphenes by direct stimulation of the cortex underneath the transcranial electrode. Here, we provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis that phosphenes are generated in the retina by current spread from the occipital electrode. Building on the existing literature, we first confirm that phosphenes are induced at lower currents when electrodes are placed farther away from visual cortex and closer to the eye. Second, we explain the temporal frequency tuning of phosphenes based on the well-known response properties of primate retinal ganglion cells. Third, we show that there is no difference in the time it takes to evoke phosphenes in the retina or by stimulation above visual cortex. Together, these findings suggest that phosphenes induced by tES over visual cortex originate in the retina. From this, we infer that tES currents spread well beyond the area of stimulation and are unlikely to lead to focal neural activation. Novel stimulation protocols that optimize current distributions are needed to overcome these limitations of tES.", "pages": "175"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Modulation of EEG oscillations via transcranial alternating current stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22944994", "authors": ["Herrmann, CS", "Neuling, T", "Rach, S", "Str\u00fcber, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Biomedizinische Technik. Biomedical engineering", "abstract": "Functional cortical circuits for central executive functions have been shown to emerge by theta (~6 Hz) phase-coupling of distant cortical areas. It has been repeatedly shown that frontoparietal theta coupling at ~0\u00b0 relative phase is associated with recognition, encoding, short-term retention, and planning; however, a causal link has not been demonstrated so far. Here we used transcranial alternating current stimulation simultaneously applied at 6 Hz over left prefrontal and parietal cortices with a relative 0\u00b0 (\"synchronized\" condition) or 180\u00b0 (\"desynchronized\" condition) phase difference or a placebo stimulation condition, whereas healthy subjects performed a delayed letter discrimination task. We show that exogenously induced frontoparietal theta synchronization significantly improves visual memory-matching reaction times as compared to placebo stimulation. In contrast, exogenously induced frontoparietal theta desynchronization deteriorates performance. The present findings provide for the first time evidence of causality of theta phase-coupling of distant cortical areas for cognitive performance in healthy humans.

It has been proposed that in conflict and reward situations, theta-band (4-8\u2009Hz) oscillatory activity in the frontal cortex may reflect an electrophysiological mechanism for coordinating neural networks monitoring behavior, as well as facilitating task-specific adaptive changes. The goal of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that theta-band oscillatory balance between right and left frontal and prefrontal regions, with a predominance role to the right hemisphere (RH), is crucial for regulatory control during decision-making under risk. In order to explore this hypothesis, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation, a novel technique that provides the opportunity to explore the functional role of neuronal oscillatory activities and to establish a causal link between specific oscillations and functional lateralization in risky decision-making situations. For this aim, healthy participants were randomly allocated to one of three stimulation groups (LH stimulation/RH stimulation/Sham stimulation), with active AC stimulation delivered in a frequency-dependent manner (at 6.5\u2009Hz; 1\u2009mA peak-to-peak). During the AC stimulation, participants performed the Balloon Analog Risk Task. This experiment revealed that participants receiving LH stimulation displayed riskier decision-making style compared to sham and RH stimulation groups. However, there was no difference in decision-making behaviors between sham and RH stimulation groups. The current study extends the notion that DLPFC activity is critical for adaptive decision-making in the context of risk-taking and emphasis the role of theta-band oscillatory activity during risky decision-making situations.", "pages": "175"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Transcranial alternating stimulation in a high gamma frequency range applied over V1 improves contrast perception but does not modulate spatial attention.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "21962982", "authors": ["Lacz\u00f3, B", "Antal, A", "Niebergall, R", "Treue, S", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "The visual system has the most complex circuitry of all the sensory systems and it also possesses the ability to undergo induced and spontaneous neuroplastic changes.

However, in the past years, significant achievements have been made in characterizing visual information processing in the human using non-invasive neurophysiological techniques, such as electrical stimulation of the brain. Transcranial direct (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied through the skull was shown to directly modulate the excitability of the motor and visual cortices in human subjects.
