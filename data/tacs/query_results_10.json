However, the lack of conclusive evidence on whether tACS is able to effectively affect cortical activity continues to limit its application. The present study aims to address this issue by exploiting the well-known inhibitory alpha rhythm in the posterior parietal cortex during visual perception and attention orientation. Four groups of healthy volunteers were tested with a Gabor patch detection and discrimination task. All participants were tested at the baseline and selective frequencies of tACS, including Sham, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, and 25 Hz. Stimulation at 6 Hz and 10 Hz over the occipito-parietal area impaired performance in the detection task compared to the baseline. The lack of a retinotopically organised effect and marginal frequency-specificity modulation in the detection task force us to be cautious about the effectiveness of tACS in modulating brain oscillations. Therefore, the present study does not provide significant evidence for tACS reliably inducing direct modulations of brain oscillations that can influence performance in a visual task.", "pages": "e56589"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Tremor suppression by rhythmic transcranial current stimulation.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "16571739", "authors": ["Brittain, JS", "Probert-Smith, P", "Aziz, TZ", "Brown, P"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Tremor can dominate Parkinson's disease and yet responds less well to dopaminergic medications than do other cardinal symptoms of this condition [1, 2]. Deep brain stimulation can provide striking tremor relief, but the introduction of stimulating electrodes deep in the substance of the brain carries significant risks, including those of hemorrhage [3]. Here, we pioneer an alternative approach in which we noninvasively apply transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) over the motor cortex [4, 5] to induce phase cancellation of the rest tremor rhythm. We first identify the timing of cortical oscillations responsible for rest tremor in the periphery by delivering tremor-frequency stimulation over motor cortex but do not couple this stimulation to the on-going tremor-instead, the rhythms simply \"drift\" in and out of phase alignment with one another. Slow alternating periods of phase cancellation and reinforcement result, informing on the phase alignments that induce the greatest change in tremor amplitude. Next, we deliver stimulation at these specified phase alignments to demonstrate controlled suppression of the on-going tremor. With this technique we can achieve almost 50% average reduction in resting tremor amplitude and in so doing form the basis of a closed-loop tremor-suppression therapy that could be extended to other oscillopathies.", "pages": "e56589"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Theoretical investigation of transcranial alternating current stimulation using realistic head model.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16971533", "authors": ["Manoli, Z", "Grossman, N", "Samaras, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Herein, we use a finite element modelling (FEM) technique to investigate the penetration and focality of tACs in comparison to a time invariant (DC) stimulation.

Two forms of low-intensity cranial electrical stimulation exist for clinical and research purposes: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In a recent study, it was demonstrated that a single session of tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (anode over right DLPFC) yields a transient improvement in subjects with chronic tinnitus and that repeated sessions can possibly be used as a treatment. In the present study, the effect of a single-session individual alpha-modulated tACS and tDCS applied at the DLPFC bilaterally is compared with tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance. A total of fifty tinnitus patients were selected and randomly assigned to the tACS or tDCS treatment. Our main result was that bifrontal tDCS modulates tinnitus annoyance and tinnitus loudness, whereas individual alpha-modulated tACS does not yield a similar result.

Nevertheless, its exact functional significance has yet to be solved. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) allows the frequency-specific modulation of ongoing oscillatory activity. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of 10 and 20 Hz tACS over left primary motor cortex (M1) on motor functions and cortical excitability in healthy subjects. To this end, tACS was applied for 10 min. Sham stimulation served as control condition. Movement speed and accuracy of the right hand were assessed in 15 right-handed subjects before and after (0, 30 and 60 min) tACS of M1. Cortical silent period (CSP) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were determined as measures of M1 excitability. While 10 Hz tACS particularly increased movement variability, especially in tasks requiring internal pacing, 20 Hz tACS resulted in movement slowing. Behavioural effects occurred in distinct time windows. While 10 Hz effects developed over 30 min after stimulation, 20 Hz tACS effects were found immediately after stimulation. Following 10 Hz tACS these effects were significantly correlated with CSP duration, indicating interference with inhibitory pathways. The present findings suggest differential effects of stimulation frequency on motor behaviour and M1 excitability.", "pages": "e56589"}, {"volume": "533", "title": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation reduces symptoms in intractable idiopathic cervical dystonia: a case study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17251360", "authors": ["Angelakis, E", "Liouta, E", "Andreadis, N", "Leonardos, A", "Ktonas, P", "Stavrinou, LC", "Miranda, PC", "Mekonnen, A", "Sakas, DE"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Idiopathic cervical dystonia (ICD) is a movement disorder often resulting in profound disability and pain.

However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp. The direction of change relative to non-stimulation reversed with tDCS stimulation polarity. For tACS there was no net effect of the MRI signal. High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation.

However, the possibility to apply tDCS in therapy of neuropsychiatric disorders is still debated. While transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been approved for treatment of major depression in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tDCS is not as widely accepted. One of the criticisms against tDCS is the lack of spatial specificity. Focality is limited by the electrode size (35\u2009cm(2) are commonly used) and the bipolar arrangement. However, a current flow through the head directly from anode to cathode is an outdated view. Finite-element (FE) models have recently been used to predict the exact current flow during tDCS. These simulations have demonstrated that the current flow depends on tissue shape and conductivity. To face the challenge to predict the location, magnitude, and direction of the current flow induced by tDCS and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), we used a refined realistic FE modeling approach. With respect to the literature on clinical tDCS and tACS, we analyzed two common setups for the location of the stimulation electrodes which target the frontal lobe and the occipital lobe, respectively. We compared lateral and medial electrode configuration with regard to their usability. We were able to demonstrate that the lateral configurations yielded more focused stimulation areas as well as higher current intensities in the target areas. The high resolution of our simulation allows one to combine the modeled current flow with the knowledge of neuronal orientation to predict the consequences of tDCS and tACS.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters spontaneous cortical activity, while transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) are presumed to induce or interfere with oscillations of cortical networks.
