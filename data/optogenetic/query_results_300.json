Within 20 s of ischemia, a >90% depression of spontaneous 0.3-3 Hz EEG and LFP power was detected. Ischemic depolarization followed EEG depression with a \u223c2 min delay. Surprisingly, neuronal excitability, as assessed by the ChR2-mediated EEG response, was intact during the period of strong spontaneous EEG suppression and actually increased before ischemic depolarization. In contrast, a decrease in the somatosensory-evoked potential (forepaw-evoked potential, reflecting cortical synaptic transmission) was coincident with the EEG suppression. After 5 min of ischemia, the animal was reperfused, and the ChR2-mediated response mostly recovered within 30 min (>80% of preischemia value). However, the recovery of the somatosensory-evoked potential was significantly delayed compared with the ChR2-mediated response (<40% of preischemia value at 60 min). By assessing intrinsic optical signals in combination with EEG, we found that neuronal excitability approached minimal values when the spreading ischemic depolarization wave propagated to the ChR2-stimulated cortex.

This recently developed technology has evolved rapidly and generated considerable excitement in neuroscience research. This technology successfully solves the severe problem of achieving both high temporal and spatial precision within intact neural tissues of animals that electrical stimulation and pharmacological methods cannot achieve. It allows neurons to express light-sensitive genes that enable the identification, dissection, and manipulation of specific neural populations and their connections in the tissues and organs of awake animals with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision. Light-sensitive genes chiefly including the genetically targeted light-gated channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) cause intracellular ion flow during optical illumination. Subsequently, the neurons undergo a series of changes resulting from membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization. To date, there are many published research articles and reviews that describe this new technology; however, few of the reports concern its application to neuropsychiatric diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent optogenetic research in these diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, fear, reward behaviors, and sleep disorders.

However, we do not know the neural activity patterns in C. elegans that are sufficient to control its complex chemotactic behaviour. To understand how the activity in its interneurons coordinate different motor programs to lead the animal to food, here we used optogenetics and new optical tools to manipulate neural activity directly in freely moving animals to evoke chemotactic behaviour. By deducing the classes of activity patterns triggered during chemotaxis and exciting individual neurons with these patterns, we identified interneurons that control the essential locomotory programs for this behaviour. Notably, we discovered that controlling the dynamics of activity in just one interneuron pair (AIY) was sufficient to force the animal to locate, turn towards and track virtual light gradients. Two distinct activity patterns triggered in AIY as the animal moved through the gradient controlled reversals and gradual turns to drive chemotactic behaviour.

We found that transient optogenetic stimulation of dorsal striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons during decision-making in mice introduced opposing biases in the distribution of choices. The effect of stimulation on choice was dependent on recent reward history and mimicked an additive change in the action value. Although stimulation before and during movement initiation produced a robust bias in choice behavior, this bias was substantially diminished when stimulation was delayed after response initiation.

We demonstrated this approach using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) to deliver the sequence of the GECI D3cpv in the mouse cerebellar cortex.

An amplified approach should be of use in monitoring neural processing in selected cell types and boosting expression of optogenetic probes.

The optical stimulation of genetically engineered cells has significantly changed our understanding of electrically excitable tissues, paving the way towards controlling heart rhythm disorders by means of photostimulation. Controlling these disorders, in turn, restores coordinated force generation to avoid sudden cardiac death. Here, we report a novel continuum framework for the photoelectrochemistry of living systems that allows us to decipher the mechanisms by which this technology regulates the electrical and mechanical function of the heart. Using a modular multiscale approach, we introduce a non-selective cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2, into a conventional cardiac muscle cell model via an additional photocurrent governed by a light-sensitive gating variable. Upon optical stimulation, this channel opens and allows sodium ions to enter the cell, inducing electrical activation. In side-by-side comparisons with conventional heart muscle cells, we show that photostimulation directly increases the sodium concentration, which indirectly decreases the potassium concentration in the cell, while all other characteristics of the cell remain virtually unchanged.

The real-time measurement of lactate concentration in the mouse cerebral cortex demonstrates that it increases during enforced wakefulness. In spontaneous sleep/wake cycles, lactate concentration builds during wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep and declines during NREMS. The rate at which lactate concentration declines during NREMS is proportional to the magnitude of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at frequencies of <10 Hz. The induction of 1-Hz oscillations, but not 10-Hz oscillations, in the electroencephalogram by optogenetic stimulation of cortical pyramidal cells during wakefulness triggers a decline in lactate concentration.

Bath application of DA had no detectable effect on odorant-evoked sensory input. DA directly hyperpolarized mitral cells (MCs) via D\u2082-like receptors and slightly increased their response gain.

Our data suggest that the topography of\u00a0movement maps arises from their segregated output projections, whereas complex movements evoked by prolonged stimulation require intracortical synaptic transmission.", "pages": "R804-6"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "Optogenetics and psychiatry: applications, challenges, and opportunities.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "15987933", "authors": ["Deisseroth, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in the maintenance of task-relevant information during goal-directed behavior. Using a combination of lesions, local inactivation, and optogenetics, we investigated the functional role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice with a novel operant delayed alternation task. Task difficulty was manipulated by changing the duration of the delay between two sequential actions. In experiment 1, we showed that excitotoxic lesions of the mPFC impaired acquisition of delayed alternation with long delays (16 s), whereas lesions of the dorsal hippocampus and ventral striatum, areas connected with the PFC, did not produce any deficits. Lesions of dorsal hippocampus, however, significantly impaired reversal learning when the rule was changed from alternation to repetition. In experiment 2, we showed that local infusions of muscimol (an agonist of the GABA(A) receptor) into mPFC impaired performance even when the animal was well trained, suggesting that the mPFC is critical not only for acquisition but also for successful performance. In experiment 3, to examine the mechanisms underlying the role of GABAergic inhibition, we used Cre-inducible Channelrhodopsin-2 to activate parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC of PV-Cre transgenic mice as they performed the task. Using whole cell patch-clamp recording, we demonstrated that activation of PV-expressing interneurons in vitro with blue light in brain slices reliably produced spiking and inhibited nearby pyramidal projection neurons. With similar stimulation parameters, in vivo stimulation significantly impaired delayed alternation performance. Together these results demonstrate a critical role for the mPFC in the acquisition and performance of the delayed alternation task.", "pages": "R804-6"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "Diode probes for spatiotemporal optical control of multiple neurons in freely moving animals.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16116447", "authors": ["Stark, E", "Koos, T", "Buzs\u00e1ki, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The complexity of neurons and neuronal circuits in brain tissue requires the genetic manipulation, labeling, and tracking of single cells.

Here, we demonstrate high-throughput, efficient, reliable, and combinatorial delivery of multiple genetic vectors and reagents into targeted cells within the same tissue sample with single-cell accuracy. Our system automatically loads nanoliter-scale volumes of reagents into a micropipette from multiwell plates, targets and transfects single cells in brain tissues using a robust electroporation technique, and finally preps the micropipette by automated cleaning for repeating the transfection cycle. We demonstrate multi-colored labeling of adjacent cells, both in organotypic and acute slices, and transfection of plasmids encoding different protein isoforms into neurons within the same brain tissue for analysis of their effects on linear dendritic spine density.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the development of individual neurons, little is known about how complex circuits are assembled to generate specific behaviors.

We first summarize what has been learned during the past decades on the connectivity and development of component neurons, in particular motor neurons and sensory feedback neurons. We then review recent progress in our understanding of the development of the circuits as well as studies that apply optogenetics and other innovative techniques to dissect the circuit diagram.

Therefore, CCK-basket cells may play an important role in regulation of hyper-excitability and seizures in the hippocampus. In normal conditions, the endogenous excitability regulator neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to modulate afferent inputs onto dentate gyrus CCK-basket cells, providing a possible novel mechanism for excitability control in the hippocampus. Using GAD65-GFP mice for CCK-basket cell identification, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we explored whether the effect of NPY on afferent synapses to CCK-basket cells is modified in the hyper-excitable dentate gyrus. To induce a hyper-excitable state, recurrent seizures were evoked by electrical stimulation of the hippocampus using the well-characterized rapid kindling protocol. The frequency of spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents recorded in CCK-basket cells was decreased by NPY. The excitatory post-synaptic currents evoked in CCK-basket cells by optogenetic activation of principal neurons were also decreased in amplitude. Interestingly, we observed an increased proportion of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents with slower rise times, indicating that NPY may inhibit gamma aminobutyric acid release preferentially in peri-somatic synapses. These findings indicate that increased levels and release of NPY observed after seizures can modulate afferent inputs to CCK-basket cells, and therefore alter their impact on the oscillatory network activity and excitability in the hippocampus.", "pages": "R804-6"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Crystal structures of Aureochrome1 LOV suggest new design strategies for optogenetics.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17224406", "authors": ["Mitra, D", "Yang, X", "Moffat, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Structure (London, England : 1993)", "abstract": "Activation of dopamine receptors in forebrain regions, for minutes or longer, is known to be sufficient for positive reinforcement of stimuli and actions. However, the firing rate of dopamine neurons is increased for only about 200 milliseconds following natural reward events that are better than expected, a response which has been described as a \"reward prediction error\" (RPE). Although RPE drives reinforcement learning (RL) in computational models, it has not been possible to directly test whether the transient dopamine signal actually drives RL. Here we have performed optical stimulation of genetically targeted ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in mice. We mimicked the transient activation of dopamine neurons that occurs in response to natural reward by applying a light pulse of 200 ms in VTA. When a single light pulse followed each self-initiated nose poke, it was sufficient in itself to cause operant reinforcement. Furthermore, when optical stimulation was delivered in separate sessions according to a predetermined pattern, it increased locomotion and contralateral rotations, behaviors that are known to result from activation of dopamine neurons. All three of the optically induced operant and locomotor behaviors were tightly correlated with the number of VTA dopamine neurons that expressed ChR2, providing additional evidence that the behavioral responses were caused by activation of dopamine neurons. These results provide strong evidence that the transient activation of dopamine neurons provides a functional reward signal that drives learning, in support of RL theories of dopamine function.", "pages": "R804-6"}]
