We show that expression of the DISC1 c-terminal truncation variant that is associated with Schizophrenia alters the frequency of mEPSCs and the kinetics of evoked glutamate release. In addition, we show that expression level of DISC1 is correlated with the probability of glutamate release such that increased DISC1 expression results in paired-pulse depression and RNAi knockdown of DISC1 produces paired-pulse facilitation.

However, this small number belies an unanticipated complexity that has only recently been revealed as a result of genomic studies. This complexity is evident at a number of levels: (i) cis-regulatory sequences; (ii) noncoding and antisense mRNAs, most of which have no known function; (iii) alternative splicing that results in the generation of multiple, subtly different mature mRNAs from the precursor transcript encoded by a single gene; and (iv) post-translational processing and modification.

To begin to address such questions, we developed a computational tool to explore the underlying principles of optogenetic neural stimulation. This \"light-neuron\" model consists of theoretical representations of the light dynamics generated by a fiber optic in brain tissue, coupled to a multicompartment cable model of a cortical pyramidal neuron embedded with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) membrane dynamics. Simulations revealed that the large energies required to generate an action potential are primarily due to the limited conductivity of ChR2, and that the major determinants of stimulation threshold are the surface area of illuminated cell membrane and proximity to the light source. Our results predict that the activation threshold is sensitive to many of the properties of ChR2 (density, conductivity, and kinetics), tissue medium (scattering and absorbance), and the fiber-optic light source (diameter and numerical aperture). We also illustrate the impact of redistributing the ChR2 expression density (uniform vs. nonuniform) on the activation threshold.

Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context specific.

This suggests that the uvula regulates blood pressure (BP) during postural alterations. Previous studies showed that lesions of the uvula affected the baroreceptor reflex and cardiovascular responses during postural alterations. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this BP regulation, it is necessary to have a method to selectively modulate the activity of Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output neurons from the cerebellar cortex, without affecting other neuronal types such as local interneurons or nonlocal neurons that send their axons to the cerebellar cortex. We recently developed a novel technique using optogenetics to manipulate PC activity and showed that activation and inhibition of PCs in the uvula either decreased or increased the resting BP, respectively. This technique was employed in the current study to examine the roles of the uvula in BP regulation during postural alterations in anesthetized rats. Enhanced Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin (eNpHR), a light-driven chloride ion pump, was selectively expressed in uvular PCs using a lentiviral vector containing the PC-specific L7 promoter. The eNpHR-expressing PCs were then illuminated by orange laser (593 nm) either during 30\u00b0 head-up or 30\u00b0 head-down tilts. The eNpHR-mediated photoinhibition of the uvula attenuated the extent of BP recovery after a BP increase induced by postural changes during head-down tilts. By contrast, photoinhibition had no statistically significant effect on BP recovery during head-up tilts. The effects of photoinhibition on BP during tilts were significantly different from those observed during the resting condition, indicating that cerebellar control of BP during tilts is dynamic rather than static. Taken together, these results suggest that PCs in the uvula dynamically regulates BP maintenance during postural alterations.", "pages": "1033-8"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "Shining light on wakefulness and arousal.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "19709632", "authors": ["de Lecea, L", "Carter, ME", "Adamantidis, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Alterations in arousal states are associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders, addiction, schizophrenia, and depression.

ChR2-evoked maps confirmed homotopic connections between hemispheres and intracortical sensory and motor cortex connections. This ability of optogentically activated subpopulations of neurons to drive appropriate downstream maps suggests that mechanisms exist to allow prototypical cortical maps to self-assemble from the stimulation of neuronal subsets. Using this principle of map self-assembly, we employed ChR2 point stimulation to map connections between cortical areas that are not selectively activated by peripheral sensory stimulation or behavior. Representing the functional cortical regions as network nodes, we identified asymmetrical connection weights in individual nodes and identified the parietal association area as a network hub.

In vitro optogenetic stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 evoked a rapid sequence of excitation followed by inhibition. Fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons received large-amplitude, fast-rising depolarizing postsynaptic potentials, often driving action potentials. In contrast, the same optogenetic stimulus evoked small-amplitude, subthreshold postsynaptic potentials in excitatory and non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons. To understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying this network activity, we investigated unitary synaptic connectivity through multiple simultaneous whole cell recordings. FS GABAergic neurons received unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials with higher probability, larger amplitudes, and faster kinetics compared with NFS GABAergic neurons and other excitatory neurons. Both FS and NFS GABAergic neurons evoked robust inhibition on postsynaptic layer 2/3 neurons. A simple computational model based on the experimentally determined electrophysiological properties of the different classes of layer 2/3 neurons and their unitary synaptic connectivity accounted for key aspects of the network activity evoked by optogenetic stimulation, including the strong recruitment of FS GABAergic neurons acting to suppress firing of excitatory neurons.

The verification of unaltered density and subcellular distribution of the virally introduced \u03b32 subunits requires their selective labelling. For this we generated six N- and six C-terminal-tagged \u03b32 subunits, with which cortical cultures of GABA(A)R\u03b32(\u2212/\u2212) mice were transduced using lentiviruses. We found that the N-terminal AU1 tag resulted in excellent immunodetection and unimpaired synaptic localization. Unaltered kinetic properties of the AU1-tagged \u03b32 ((AU1)\u03b32(77F)) channels were demonstrated with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous IPSCs from cultured cells.

When the number of driven cells is too small, however, the synaptic interactions may not be strong or homogeneous enough to support the mechanism underlying the rhythm. Using a combination of computational simulation and mathematical analysis, we study the breakdown of gamma rhythms as the driven ensembles become too small, or the synaptic interactions become too weak and heterogeneous. Heterogeneities in drives or synaptic strengths play an important role in the breakdown of the rhythms; nonetheless, we find that the analysis of homogeneous networks yields insight into the breakdown of rhythms in heterogeneous networks. In particular, if parameter values are such that in a homogeneous network, it takes several gamma cycles to converge to synchrony, then in a similar, but realistically heterogeneous network, synchrony breaks down altogether. This leads to the surprising conclusion that in a network with realistic heterogeneity, gamma rhythms based on the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory cell populations must arise either rapidly, or not at all. For given synaptic strengths and heterogeneities, there is a (soft) lower bound on the possible number of cells in an ensemble oscillating at gamma frequency, based simply on the requirement that synaptic interactions between the two cell populations be strong enough. This observation suggests explanations for recent experimental results concerning the modulation of gamma oscillations in macaque primary visual cortex by varying spatial stimulus size or attention level, and for our own experimental results, reported here, concerning the optogenetic modulation of gamma oscillations in kainate-activated hippocampal slices.

By expressing the light-responsive ChR in neurons using cell-type selective promoters or other methods, specific neurons can be depolarized by light in a temporally precise manner with millisecond resolution even if their membrane biophysical properties are less favorable for electrical stimulation. In addition, ChRs can be used to depolarize nonneuronal cells in the nervous tissue, and to sustain depolarization over a prolonged period of time, both of which cannot be achieved with electrical or magnetic stimulations. To conduct an experiment with ChR, experimenters need to make the correct choices on the three main components to such an experiment: the expression system, the illumination source, and the ChR variant used. This chapter aims to provide some discussions on the current developments of these aspects of the experiments. To express ChR in neurons, the common expression systems include viral vectors, in utero electroporation, and transgenic animals, each with their advantages and limitations regarding the cost, expression pattern, and the required effort. In terms of the instrumentation, an illumination source that is capable of providing the desired wavelength with high intensity is crucial for the success of the experiment. The important factors regarding the light source used include the cost, light density output, efficiency for fiber coupling for in vivo rodent experiments, and the available methods to control light intensity and onset/termination. The third component of the experiment is the choice of the appropriate variants of ChR. Many novel ChR variants with unique properties have been engineered, and it can be difficult for the experimenters to choose the right variant with the desired properties for their experiments, as some information necessary for the experimenter to make the right selection is often incomplete or unavailable. Currently, the available variants for neuroscientific research are wild-type ChR2, ChR2+H134R, ChETA, VChR1, SFO, ChD, ChEF, ChIEF, ChRGR, CatCh, and TC. The features and limitations of these different variants are presented here. Lastly, this chapter will provide some suggestion for the future development of the light source, expression system, and the development of the \"next\" generation of ChRs.", "pages": "1033-8"}, {"volume": "196", "title": "A comprehensive concept of optogenetics.", "issue": "", "pmid": "20871612", "authors": ["Dugu\u00e9, GP", "Akemann, W", "Kn\u00f6pfel, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "abstract": "Fundamental questions that neuroscientists have previously approached with classical biochemical and electrophysiological techniques can now be addressed using optogenetics.

The recent development of optogenetic technologies offers the opportunity to use light to precisely activate this specific cohort of neurons without affecting surrounding neurons. Here, we present a series of procedures to virally express Channelrhodopsin2(ChR2)-YFP in a temporally restricted cohort of neuroblasts in the RMS before they reach the olfactory bulb and become adult-born neurons.

Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation as well as in several behavioural adaptations.

Multiple tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)::Cre and choline acetyltransferase (Chat)::Cre lines were produced that exhibited specific opsin expression in targeted cell types. We additionally developed methods for utilizing optogenetic tools in freely moving rats and leveraged these technologies to clarify the causal relationship between dopamine (DA) neuron firing and positive reinforcement, observing that optical stimulation of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Th::Cre rats is sufficient to support vigorous intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). These studies complement existing targeting approaches by extending the generalizability of optogenetics to traditionally non-genetically-tractable but vital animal models.", "pages": "1033-8"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Optetrode: a multichannel readout for optogenetic control in freely moving mice.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17675407", "authors": ["Anikeeva, P", "Andalman, AS", "Witten, I", "Warden, M", "Goshen, I", "Grosenick, L", "Gunaydin, LA", "Frank, LM", "Deisseroth, K"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "Maintaining the right balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial to healthy brain function.
