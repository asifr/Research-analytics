We show in adult anesthetized rats that local pharmacological disinhibition or optogenetic excitation of the RTN/pFRG can generate AE and transforms previously silent RTN/pFRG neurons into rhythmically active cells whose firing is correlated with late-phase active expiration. Brief excitatory stimuli also reset the respiratory rhythm, indicating strong coupling of AE to inspiration. The AE network location in adult rats overlaps with the perinatal pFRG and appears lateral to the chemosensitive region of adult RTN.

The recent introduction of light sensitive effectors such as channel-rhodopsin and caged neurotransmitters have led to interests in developing better means to control patterns of light in space and time that are useful for experimental neuroscience. One conventional strategy, employed in confocal and 2-photon microscopy, is to focus light to a diffraction limited spot and then scan that single spot sequentially over the region of interest. This approach becomes problematic if large areas have to be stimulated within a brief time window, a problem more applicable to photostimulation than for imaging. An alternate strategy is to project the complete spatial pattern on the target with the aid of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The DMD approach is appealing because the hardware components are relatively inexpensive and is supported by commercial interests. Because such a system is not available for upright microscopes, we will discuss the critical issues in the construction and operations of such a DMD system. Even though we will be primarily describing the construction of the system for UV photolysis, the modifications for building the much simpler visible light system for optogenetic experiments will also be provided. The UV photolysis system was used to carryout experiments to study a fundamental question in neuroscience, how are spatially distributed inputs integrated across distal dendritic branch points.

Anxiety disorders represent the most common of psychiatric diseases (28% lifetime prevalence) and contribute to the aetiology of major depression and substance abuse. Although it has been proposed that the amygdala, a brain region important for emotional processing, has a role in anxiety, the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear. Here we explore the neural circuits underlying anxiety-related behaviours by using optogenetics with two-photon microscopy, anxiety assays in freely moving mice, and electrophysiology. With the capability of optogenetics to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells, we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)--achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA--exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. Together, these results implicate specific BLA-CeA projections as critical circuit elements for acute anxiety control in the mammalian brain, and demonstrate the importance of optogenetically targeting defined projections, beyond simply targeting cell types, in the study of circuit function relevant to neuropsychiatric disease.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Optogenetics in the teaching laboratory: using channelrhodopsin-2 to study the neural basis of behavior and synaptic physiology in Drosophila.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21041315", "authors": ["Pulver, SR", "Hornstein, NJ", "Land, BL", "Johnson, BR"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Advances in physiology education", "abstract": "Here we incorporate recent advances in Drosophila neurogenetics and \"optogenetics\" into neuroscience laboratory exercises.

We conclude that the observed effects were caused by cAMP synthesis because of photoactivation of pre-synaptic PAC\u03b1 which subsequently triggered acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. Our results demonstrate that PAC\u03b1 can be used as an optogenetic tool in C. elegans for straightforward in vivo manipulation of intracellular cAMP levels by light, with good temporal control and high cell specificity.

In the present study, we used computational modeling to investigate the origin of these local transformations, and to make predictions about their impact on downstream signal transmission.

Enhanced spiking in a second neocortical area, without a net increase in overall driven spikes in the first area, resulted from faster depolarization of target neurons due to increased pre-synaptic synchrony. In addition, we found that the precise temporal structure of spiking in the first area impacted the gain between cortical areas. The optimal spike distribution matched the \"window of opportunity\" defined by the timing of inhibition in the target area: spiking beyond this window did not contribute to downstream spike generation, leading to decreased overall gain.

This enzymatic activity decays thermally within 20 s in parallel with the red-shifted BLUF photointermediate. bPAC is well expressed in pyramidal neurons and, in combination with cyclic nucleotide gated channels, causes efficient light-induced depolarization. In the Drosophila central nervous system, bPAC mediates light-dependent cAMP increase and behavioral changes in freely moving animals. bPAC seems a perfect optogenetic tool for light modulation of cAMP in neuronal cells and tissues and for studying cAMP-dependent processes in live animals.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Optogenetic in vivo cell manipulation in KillerRed-expressing zebrafish transgenics.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19584920", "authors": ["Teh, C", "Chudakov, DM", "Poon, KL", "Mamedov, IZ", "Sek, JY", "Shidlovsky, K", "Lukyanov, S", "Korzh, V"], "year": "2010", "journal": "BMC developmental biology", "abstract": "Cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, are ubiquitous second messengers that regulate metabolic and behavioral responses in diverse organisms.

BlaC contains a BLUF domain involved in blue-light sensing using FAD and a nucleotidyl cyclase domain. The blaC gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product was purified. Irradiation of BlaC in vitro resulted in a small red shift in flavin absorbance, typical of BLUF photoreceptors. BlaC had adenylyl cyclase activity that was negligible in the dark and up-regulated by light by 2 orders of magnitude. To convert BlaC into a guanylyl cyclase, we constructed a model of the nucleotidyl cyclase domain and mutagenized several residues predicted to be involved in substrate binding. One triple mutant, designated BlgC, was found to have photoactivated guanylyl cyclase in vitro. Irradiation with blue light of the E. coli cya mutant expressing BlaC or BlgC resulted in the significant increases in cAMP or cGMP synthesis, respectively. BlaC, but not BlgC, restored cAMP-dependent growth of the mutant in the presence of light.

Photoreceptors resemble fluorescent reporter proteins such as GFP in being genetically encoded, non-invasive, and applicable to intact cells and organisms.

To understand and precisely control 5-HT(1A) signaling, we created a light-activated G protein-coupled receptor that targets into 5-HT(1A) receptor domains and substitutes for endogenous 5-HT(1A) receptors. To induce 5-HT(1A)-like targeting, vertebrate rhodopsin was tagged with the C-terminal domain (CT) of 5-HT(1A) (Rh-CT(5-HT1A)). Rh-CT(5-HT1A) activates G protein-coupled inward rectifying K(+) channels in response to light and causes membrane hyperpolarization in hippocampal neurons, similar to the agonist-induced responses of the 5-HT(1A) receptor. The intracellular distribution of Rh-CT(5-HT1A) resembles that of the 5-HT(1A) receptor; Rh-CT(5-HT1A) localizes to somatodendritic sites and is efficiently trafficked to distal dendritic processes. Additionally, neuronal expression of Rh-CT(5-HT1A), but not Rh, decreases 5-HT(1A) agonist sensitivity, suggesting that Rh-CT(5-HT1A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors compete to interact with the same trafficking machinery.

Optimal uses and potential future improvements of ChRs as optogenetic tools are also discussed.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Optical activation of lateral amygdala pyramidal cells instructs associative fear learning.", "issue": "28", "pmid": "10567264", "authors": ["Johansen, JP", "Hamanaka, H", "Monfils, MH", "Behnia, R", "Deisseroth, K", "Blair, HT", "LeDoux, JE"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "abstract": "Humans and animals can learn that specific sensory cues in the environment predict aversive events through a form of associative learning termed fear conditioning.

Activation of lateral amygdala (LA) pyramidal neurons by aversive stimuli is thought to drive the formation of these associative fear memories; yet, there have been no direct tests of this hypothesis. Here we demonstrate that viral-targeted, tissue-specific expression of the light-activated channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in LA pyramidal cells permitted optical control of LA neuronal activity. Using this approach we then paired an auditory sensory cue with optical stimulation of LA pyramidal neurons instead of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently presentation of the tone alone produced behavioral fear responses.

Two parallel basal ganglia pathways have been described, and have been proposed to exert opposing influences on motor function. According to this classical model, activation of the 'direct' pathway facilitates movement and activation of the 'indirect' pathway inhibits movement. However, more recent anatomical and functional evidence has called into question the validity of this hypothesis. Because this model has never been empirically tested, the specific function of these circuits in behaving animals remains unknown. Here we report direct activation of basal ganglia circuitry in vivo, using optogenetic control of direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), achieved through Cre-dependent viral expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the striatum of bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of regulatory elements for the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor. Bilateral excitation of indirect-pathway MSNs elicited a parkinsonian state, distinguished by increased freezing, bradykinesia and decreased locomotor initiations. In contrast, activation of direct-pathway MSNs reduced freezing and increased locomotion. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, direct-pathway activation completely rescued deficits in freezing, bradykinesia and locomotor initiation. Taken together, our findings establish a critical role for basal ganglia circuitry in the bidirectional regulation of motor behaviour and indicate that modulation of direct-pathway circuitry may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Competitive regulation of synaptic Ca2+ influx by D2 dopamine and A2A adenosine receptors.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "12042369", "authors": ["Higley, MJ", "Sabatini, BL"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Nature neuroscience", "abstract": "Striatal D2-type dopamine receptors (D2Rs) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

We combined optogenetics, two-photon microscopy and glutamate uncaging to examine D2R-dependent modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in mouse striatopallidal neurons. We found that D2R activation reduces corticostriatal glutamate release and attenuates both synaptic- and action potential-evoked Ca2+ influx into dendritic spines by approximately 50%. Modulation of Ca2+ signaling was mediated by a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of Ca2+ entry through NMDA-type glutamate receptors that was inhibited by D2Rs and enhanced by activation of 2A-type adenosine receptors (A2ARs). D2Rs also produced a PKA- and A2AR-independent reduction in Ca2+ influx through R-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

By combining the tight spatial and temporal resolution of both optogenetics and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry we have determined the parameters necessary to control phasic dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of rats in vivo. The kinetics of optically induced dopamine release mirror established models of electrically evoked release, indicating that potential artifacts of electrical stimulation on ion channels and the dopamine transporter are negligible. Furthermore a lack of change in extracellular pH indicates that optical stimulation does not alter blood flow. Optical control over dopamine release is highly reproducible and flexible. We are able to repeatedly evoke concentrations of dopamine release as small as a single dopamine transient (50 nM).

The quick phases of the OKR resemble the saccades observed during free viewing. It is unclear to what extent the premotor circuitry underlying these two types of jerky, conjugate eye movements is conserved among vertebrates. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, broadly expressing halorhodopsin (NpHR) or channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in most neurons, were used to map the location of neurons involved in this behavior. By blocking activity in localized groups of NpHR-expressing neurons with an optic fiber positioned above the head of the fish and by systematically varying the site of photostimulation, we discovered that activity in a small hindbrain area in rhombomere 5 was necessary for saccades to occur. Unilateral block of activity at this site affected behavior in a direction-specific manner. Inhibition of the right side suppressed rightward saccades of both eyes, while leaving leftward saccades unaffected, and vice versa. Photostimulation of this area in ChR2-transgenic fish was sufficient to trigger saccades that were precisely locked to the light pulses. These extra saccades could be induced both during free viewing and during the OKR, and were distinct in their kinetics from eye movements elicited by stimulating the abducens motor neurons. Zebrafish double indemnity (didy) mutants were identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen based on a defect in sustaining saccades during OKR. Positional cloning, molecular analysis, and electrophysiology revealed that the didy mutation disrupts the voltage-gated sodium channel Scn1lab (Nav1.lb). ChR2 photostimulation of the putative hindbrain saccade generator was able to fully reconstitute saccades in the didy mutant. Our studies demonstrate that an optogenetic approach is useful for targeted loss-of-function and gain-of-function manipulations of neural circuitry underlying eye movements in zebrafish and that the saccade-generating circuit in this species shares many of its properties with that in mammals.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Glutamatergic signaling by mesolimbic dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens.", "issue": "20", "pmid": "6811952", "authors": ["Tecuapetla, F", "Patel, JC", "Xenias, H", "English, D", "Tadros, I", "Shah, F", "Berlin, J", "Deisseroth, K", "Rice, ME", "Tepper, JM", "Koos, T"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests the intriguing possibility that midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons may use fast glutamatergic transmission to communicate with their postsynaptic targets.

Consequently, it remains uncertain whether glutamatergic signaling between DAergic neurons and their postsynaptic targets exists under physiological conditions.

Using a novel integrated technology unifying optogenetic control of inputs with high-field fMRI signal readouts, we show here that specific stimulation of local CaMKIIalpha-expressing excitatory neurons, either in the neocortex or thalamus, elicits positive BOLD signals at the stimulus location with classical kinetics. We also show that optogenetic fMRI (of MRI) allows visualization of the causal effects of specific cell types defined not only by genetic identity and cell body location, but also by axonal projection target.

We designed and validated an engineered opsin gene (ChETA) that addresses all of these limitations (profoundly reducing extra spikes, eliminating plateau potentials and allowing temporally stationary, sustained spike trains up to at least 200 Hz).", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Red-shifted voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "16495944", "authors": ["Perron, A", "Mutoh, H", "Launey, T", "Kn\u00f6pfel, T"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Chemistry & biology", "abstract": "Electrical signals generated by nerve cells provide the basis of brain function. Whereas single or small numbers of cells are easily accessible using microelectrode recording techniques, less invasive optogenetic methods with spectral properties optimized for in vivo imaging are required for elucidating the operation mechanisms of neuronal circuits composed of large numbers of neurons originating from heterogeneous populations. To this end, we generated and characterized a series of genetically encoded voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins by molecular fusion of the voltage-sensing domain of Ci-VSP (Ciona intestinalis voltage sensor-containing phosphatase) to red-shifted fluorescent protein operands. We show how these indicator proteins convert voltage-dependent structural rearrangements into a modulation of fluorescence output and demonstrate their applicability for optical recording of individual or simultaneous electrical signals in cultured hippocampal neurons at single-cell resolution without temporal averaging.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "463", "title": "High-performance genetically targetable optical neural silencing by light-driven proton pumps.", "issue": "7277", "pmid": "17292680", "authors": ["Chow, BY", "Han, X", "Dobry, AS", "Qian, X", "Chuong, AS", "Li, M", "Henninger, MA", "Belfort, GM", "Lin, Y", "Monahan, PE", "Boyden, ES"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Nature", "abstract": "The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.", "pages": "1955-62"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Dissecting the neural circuitry of addiction and psychiatric disease with optogenetics.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17559094", "authors": ["Stuber, GD"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "", "pages": "1955-62"}]
