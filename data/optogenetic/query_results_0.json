There exists now a wide range of experimentally validated protein tools capable of modifying cellular function, including light-gated ion channels, recombinant light-gated G protein-coupled receptors, and even neurotransmitter receptors modified with tethered photo-switchable ligands. A large number of genetically encoded protein sensors have also been developed to optically track cellular activity in real time, including membrane-voltage-sensitive fluorophores and fluorescent calcium and pH indicators. The development of techniques for controlled expression of these proteins has also increased their utility by allowing the study of specific populations of cells. Additionally, recent advances in optics technology have enabled both activation and observation of target proteins with high spatiotemporal fidelity. In combination, these methods have great potential in the study of neural circuits and networks, behavior, animal models of disease, as well as in high-throughput ex vivo studies.

Following optogenetic hyperstimulation of Caenorhabditis elegans motoneurons, we analyzed synaptic recovery by time-resolved behavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural assays. Recovery of docked SVs and of evoked-release amplitudes (indicating readily-releasable pool refilling) occurred within \u223c8-20 s (\u03c4 = 9.2 s and \u03c4 = 11.9 s), whereas locomotion recovered only after \u223c60 s (\u03c4 = 20 s). During \u223c11-s stimulation, 50- to 200-nm noncoated vesicles (\"100nm vesicles\") formed, which disappeared \u223c8 s poststimulation, likely representing endocytic intermediates from which SVs may regenerate. In endophilin, synaptojanin, and dynamin mutants, affecting endocytosis and vesicle scission, resolving 100nm vesicles was delayed (>20 s). In dynamin mutants, 100nm vesicles were abundant and persistent, sometimes continuous with the plasma membrane; incomplete budding of smaller vesicles from 100nm vesicles further implicates dynamin in regenerating SVs from bulk-endocytosed vesicles. Synaptic recovery after exhaustive activity is slow, and different time scales of recovery at ultrastructural, physiological, and behavioral levels indicate multiple contributing processes. Similar processes may jointly account for slow recovery from acute seizures also in higher animals.", "pages": "18"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Optical control of mammalian endogenous transcription and epigenetic states.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23877069", "authors": ["Konermann, S", "Brigham, MD", "Trevino, A", "Hsu, PD", "Heidenreich, M", "", "Platt, RJ", "Scott, DA", "Church, GM", "Zhang, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Nature", "abstract": "The dynamic nature of gene expression enables cellular programming, homeostasis and environmental adaptation in living systems.

LITEs can be packaged into viral vectors and genetically targeted to probe specific cell populations. We have applied this system in primary mouse neurons, as well as in the brain of freely behaving mice in vivo to mediate reversible modulation of mammalian endogenous gene expression as well as targeted epigenetic chromatin modifications.

Adult-born neurons in the DG functionally integrate into the hippocampal circuitry and form functional synapses, suggesting a role for these neurons in hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Although results from earlier behavioral studies addressing this issue were inconsistent, recent advances in conditional gene targeting technology, viral injection and optogenetic approaches have provided convincing evidence supporting a role for adult-born neurons in the more challenging forms of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Here, we briefly summarize these recent studies with a focus on extra signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 5, a MAP kinase whose expression in the adult brain is restricted to the neurogenic regions including the SGZ and SVZ. We review evidence identifying ERK5 as a novel endogenous signaling pathway that regulates the pro-neural transcription factor Neurogenin 2, is activated by neurotrophins and is critical for adult neurogenesis. We discuss studies demonstrating that specific deletion of ERK5 in the adult neurogenic regions impairs several forms of hippocampus-dependent memory formation in mice. These include contextual fear memory extinction, the establishment and maintenance of remote contextual fear memory, and several other challenging forms of hippocampus-dependent memory formation including 48h memory for novel object recognition, contextual fear memory established by a weak foot shock, pattern separation, and reversal of spatial learning and memory.

Here, we present an enzyme kinetic algorithm that allowed us to calculate the ion composition of the initial and steady-state photocurrents for multication media. The approach is based on current-voltage relations determined for the individual ions H(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+). We identify and quantify the widely different competition of the ions in wild-type channelrhodopsin-2 and two high-performing channelrhodopsin variants CatCh+ and C1V1. Both variants show enhanced Ca(2+) conductance, but only CatCh+ displays high steady-state Ca(2+) currents at neutral pH due to reduced H+ competition and low inactivation. We demonstrate that for optogenetic applications, one should always take into account that the variable equilibria of the two open states depend on light intensity, voltage, and the ionic composition of the medium.", "pages": "18"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Thy1-expressing neurons in the basolateral amygdala may mediate fear inhibition.", "issue": "25", "pmid": "23825316", "authors": ["Konadhode, RR", "Pelluru, D", "Blanco-Centurion, C", "Zayachkivsky, A", "Liu, M", "Uhde, T", "Glen, WB", "van den Pol, AN", "Mulholland, PJ", "Shiromani, PJ"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Numerous clinical conditions can be treated by neuromodulation of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

M4 receptors mediated hyperpolarizing responses by activating inwardly rectifying K(+) channels, whereas the depolarizing responses were inhibited by the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine but were unaffected by M1, M4 or M5 receptor modulators. In addition, activation of M4 receptors significantly altered biphasic interneuron firing patterns. Anatomically, interneuron soma location appeared predictive of muscarinic response types but response types did not correlate with interneuron morphological subclasses. Together these observations suggest that the hippocampal CA1 interneuron network will be differentially affected by cholinergic input activity levels. Low levels of cholinergic activity will preferentially suppress some interneurons via hyperpolarization and increased activity will recruit other interneurons to depolarize, possibly because of elevated extracellular ACh concentrations.

Previous studies have demonstrated a crucial role for dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-containing striatal MSNs in mediating psychostimulant induced plasticity changes. These D1-MSNs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) positively regulate drug seeking, reward, and locomotor behavioral effects as well as the morphological adaptations of psychostimulant drugs. Here, we demonstrate that rats that actively self-administer cocaine display reduced levels of Tiam1 in the NAc. To further examine the cell type-specific contribution to these changes in Tiam1 we used optogenetics to selectively manipulate NAc D1-MSNs or dopamine receptor 2 (D2) expressing MSNs. We find that repeated channelrhodopsin-2 activation of D1-MSNs but not D2-MSNs caused a down-regulation of Tiam1 levels similar to the effects of cocaine. Further, activation of D2-MSNs, which caused a late blunted cocaine-mediated locomotor behavioral response, did not alter Tiam1 levels. We then examined the contribution of D1-MSNs to the cocaine-mediated decrease of Tiam1. Using the light activated chloride pump, eNpHR3.0 (enhanced Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin 3.0), we selectively inhibited D1-MSNs during cocaine exposure, which resulted in a behavioral blockade of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Moreover, inhibiting these NAc D1-MSNs during cocaine exposure reversed the down-regulation of Tiam1 gene expression and protein levels.

However, observation alone can only lead to an analysis of correlations. Experimental perturbations are required to understand the causal relationships between the components that constitute the system under study. Our current understanding of the function of the brain, which is a complex multicellular organ, suggests that communication between cells underlies the formation of the mind. This has been mainly deduced from studies of correlations between cell activity and animal behavior. Recently developed tools have enabled the specific control of cell activity. For example, light-sensitive proteins, such as channelrhodopsin-2, that are found in microorganisms can now be genetically expressed in mammalian brain cells, allowing experimenters to optically control cell activity at will. In this review, I introduce the recently established method, Knockin-mediated ENhanced Gene Expression by the improved tetracycline-controlled gene induction (KENGE-tet) method, which has generated a repertoire of transgenic mice that express levels of the highly light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 mutant that are sufficient to stimulate multiple cell types. In addition to neurons, manipulations of the activities of nonexcitable glial cells in vivo have also proved possible. A recent report that used the KENGE-tet has shown that the selective optogenetic stimulation of glia can lead to the release of glutamate as a gliotransmitter, synaptic plasticity, and the acceleration of cerebellar-modulated motor learning. These findings have suggested that glia also participate in brain information processing, a function once thought to be solely mediated by neuronal activity.

In striatum, D2Rs are expressed by approximately half of the principal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), the striatopallidal neurons of the so-called 'indirect' pathway.

Since circuit-level analysis is particularly feasible in the mouse, we asked whether neural signatures of spatial integration in mouse V1 are similar to those of higher-order mammals, and investigated the role of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons. Analogous to what is known from primates and carnivores, we demonstrate that, in awake mice, surround suppression is present in the majority of V1 neurons and is strongest in superficial cortical layers. Anesthesia with isoflurane/urethane, however, profoundly affects spatial integration: it reduces the laminar dependency, decreases overall suppression strength and alters the temporal dynamics of responses. We show that these effects of brain state can be parsimoniously explained by assuming that anesthesia affects contrast normalization. Hence, the full impact of suppressive influences in mouse V1 cannot be studied under anesthesia with isoflurane/urethane. To assess the neural circuits of spatial integration we targeted PV+ interneurons using optogenetics. Optogenetic depolarization of PV+ interneurons resulted in increased RF size and decreased suppression, similar to effects of lowering stimulus contrast, suggesting that PV+ interneurons contribute to spatial integration by affecting overall stimulus drive.

However, previous attempts to elucidate the mechanisms of these dopaminergic controls have not fully explained how the motivational and learning aspects are related and whether they can be understood by the way the activity of dopamine neurons itself is controlled by their upstream circuitries.

Simulations show that the model could reproduce the observed distinct motivational effects of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptor antagonists. Simultaneously, our model successfully explains the dopaminergic representation of reward prediction error as observed in behaving animals during learning tasks and could also explain distinct choice biases induced by optogenetic stimulation of the D1 and D2 receptor-expressing striatal neurons.

By contrast to other seven-transmembrane proteins that require second messengers to open ion channels, ChR2 form ion channels themselves, allowing ultrafast depolarization (within 50milliseconds of illumination). It has been shown that integration of ChR2 into various tissues of mice can activate neural circuits, control heart muscle contractions, and even restore breathing after spinal cord injury.
