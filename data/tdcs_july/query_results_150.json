Given the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neuroplasticity, the current study tested whether tDCS, using different electrode montages, can increase the neuroplastic effects of mental imagery on motor learning. Eighteen healthy right-handed adults underwent a randomised sham-controlled crossover experiment to receive mental training combined with either sham or active anodal tDCS of the right primary motor cortex (M1), right supplementary motor area, right premotor area, right cerebellum or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Motor performance was assessed by a blinded rater using: non-dominant handwriting time and legibility, and mentally trained task at baseline (pre) and immediately after (post) mental practice combined with tDCS. Active tDCS significantly enhances the motor-imagery-induced improvement in motor function as compared with sham tDCS. There was a specific effect for the site of stimulation such that effects were only observed after M1 and DLPFC stimulation during mental practice. These findings provide new insights into motor imagery training and point out that two cortical targets (M1 and DLPFC) are significantly associated with the neuroplastic effects of mental imagery on motor learning. Further studies should explore a similar paradigm in patients with brain lesions.", "pages": "786-94"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Bifrontal tDCS prevents implicit learning acquisition in antidepressant-free patients with major depressive disorder.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23274503", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Zanao, TA", "Ferrucci, R", "Priori, A", "Valiengo, L", "de Oliveira, JF", "Boggio, PS", "Lotufo, PA", "Bense\u00f1or, IM", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The findings for implicit (procedural) learning impairment in major depression are mixed. We investigated this issue using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method that non-invasively increases/decreases cortical activity. Twenty-eight age- and gender-matched, antidepressant-free depressed subjects received a single-session of active/sham tDCS. We used a bifrontal setup - anode and cathode over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. The probabilistic classification-learning (PCL) task was administered before and during tDCS. The percentage of correct responses improved during sham; although not during active tDCS. Procedural or implicit learning acquisition between tasks also occurred only for sham. We discuss whether DLPFC activation decreased activity in subcortical structures due to the depressive state. The deactivation of the right DLPFC by cathodal tDCS can also account for our results. To conclude, active bifrontal tDCS prevented implicit learning in depressive patients. Further studies with different tDCS montages and in other samples are necessary.", "pages": "786-94"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Differential frontal involvement in shifts of internal and perceptual attention.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "23266133", "authors": ["Tanoue, RT", "Jones, KT", "Peterson, DJ", "Berryhill, ME"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Perceptual attention enhances the processing of items in the environment, whereas internal attention enhances processing of items encoded in visual working memory.
