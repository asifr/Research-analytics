However, emotional regulation is a process subject to major inter-individual differences, some of which may be explained by personality traits. In the present study we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left DLPFC to investigate whether transiently increasing the activity of this region resulted in changes in the ratings of positive, neutral and negative emotional pictures. Results revealed that anodal, but not cathodal, tDCS reduced the perceived degree of emotional valence for negative stimuli, possibly due to an enhancement of cognitive control of emotional expression. We also aimed to determine whether personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) might condition the impact of tDCS. We found that individuals with higher scores on the introversion personality dimension were more permeable than extraverts to the modulatory effects of the stimulation. The present study underlines the role of the left DLPFC in emotional regulation, and stresses the importance of considering individual personality characteristics as a relevant variable, although replication is needed given the limited sample size of our study.", "pages": "231-41"}, {"volume": "168", "title": "Muting the voice: a case of arterial spin labeling-monitored transcranial direct current stimulation treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "20633386", "authors": ["Homan, P", "Kindler, J", "Federspiel, A", "Flury, R", "Hubl, D", "Hauf, M", "Dierks, T"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The American journal of psychiatry", "abstract": "No rehabilitation intervention has effectively improved functional use of the arm and hand in patients with severe upper limb paresis after stroke.
