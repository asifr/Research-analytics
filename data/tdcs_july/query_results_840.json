TMS allows neurostimulation and neuromodulation, while tDCS is a purely neuromodulatory application. TMS and tDCS allow diagnostic and interventional neurophysiology applications, and focal neuropharmacology delivery. However, the physics and basic mechanisms of action remain incompletely explored. Following an overview of the history and current applications of noninvasive brain stimulation, we review stimulation device design principles, the electromagnetic and physical foundations of the techniques, and the current knowledge about the electrophysiologic basis of the effects. Finally, we discuss potential biomedical and electrical engineering developments that could lead to more effective stimulation devices, better suited for the specific applications.", "pages": "527-65"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Exploring the physiological effects of double-cone coil TMS over the medial frontal cortex on the anterior cingulate cortex: an H2(15)O PET study.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "17439499", "authors": ["Hayward, G", "Mehta, MA", "Harmer, C", "Spinks, TJ", "Grasby, PM", "Goodwin, GM"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using a double-cone coil over the medial frontal cortex has the potential to clarify the function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in cognition, emotion and mood disorders. Following demonstration of disruption of performance on psychological tasks closely linked to cingulate function using this TMS technique, the current study aimed to directly measure the regional distribution of physiological effects of stimulation in the brain with H2(15)O PET. Experiment 1 assessed the effect of increasing numbers of pulse trains of TMS on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Experiment 2 assessed the capacity of medial frontal TMS to modulate brain activity associated with the Stroop task using medial parietal TMS as a control site of stimulation. SPM99 analyses, using the ACC as a region of interest, revealed clusters of increased rCBF during medial frontal TMS in Brodmann area 24 and reduced rCBF in more ventral ACC, the latter occurring in both experiments. In a whole-brain analysis, striking changes in rCBF were observed distal to the ACC following medial frontal TMS. Although TMS reliably affected Stroop task performance in early trials, there was no interaction between TMS and Stroop condition in rCBF. Our results suggest that medial frontal TMS using the double-cone coil can affect ACC activity. However, a number of more distal cortical areas were also affected in these experiments. These additional changes may reflect either 'downstream' effects of altered cingulate cortex activity or direct effects of the coil.", "pages": "527-65"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Timing-dependent modulation of associative plasticity by general network excitability in the human motor cortex.", "issue": "14", "pmid": "17409245", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Roth, A", "Kuo, MF", "Fischer, AK", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Associative neuroplasticity, which encompasses the modification of synaptic strength by coactivation of two synaptic inputs, has been linked to learning processes. Because unlimited plasticity destabilizes neuronal networks, homeostatic rules were proposed and experimentally proven that control for the amount and direction of plasticity dependent on background network activity. Accordingly, low background activity would enhance facilitatory plasticity, whereas high background activity would inhibit it. However, the impact of background excitability on associative plasticity has not been studied so far in humans. Facilitatory associative plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS) in the human motor cortex, whereas background activity was enhanced or diminished by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). When applied before PAS, excitability-enhancing tDCS also boosted the efficacy of PAS, whereas excitability-diminishing tDCS turned it into inhibition. Thus, previous background activity does not influence associative plasticity homeostatically. When tDCS and PAS were applied simultaneously, now in accordance with homeostatic rules of neuroplasticity, reduced background activity resulted in a prolonged excitability enhancement by PAS, whereas enhanced background activity turned it into inhibition. We conclude that background network activity can influence associative plasticity homeostatically. However, only simultaneous modulation of both parameters is in accordance with homeostatic concepts. These findings might be of importance for the development of plasticity-inducing stimulation protocols supporting information processing in humans.", "pages": "527-65"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation: a computer-based human model study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "17337213", "authors": ["Wagner, T", "Fregni, F", "Fecteau, S", "Grodzinsky, A", "Zahn, M", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Interest in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in clinical practice has been growing, however, the knowledge about its efficacy and mechanisms of action remains limited.
