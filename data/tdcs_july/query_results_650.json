Its safety profile places tDCS in the pole-position for translating in real-world therapeutic application. However, an episode of transient respiratory depression in a subject receiving tDCS with an extracephalic electrode led to the suggestion that such an electrode montage could modulate the brainstem autonomic centres. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the midline frontal cortex in 30 healthy volunteers (sham n = 10, cathodal n = 10, anodal n = 10) with an extracephalic reference electrode would modulate brainstem activity as reflected by the monitoring and stringent analysis of vital parameters: heart rate (variability), respiratory rate, blood pressure and sympatho-vagal balance. We reasoned that this study could lead to two opposite but equally interesting outcomes: 1) If tDCS with an extracephalic electrode modulated vital parameters, it could be used as a new tool to explore the autonomic nervous system and, even, to modulate its activity for therapeutic purposes. 2) On the opposite, if applying tDCS with an extracephalic electrode had no effect, it could thus be used safely in healthy human subjects. This outcome would significantly impact the field of non-invasive brain stimulation with tDCS. Indeed, on the one hand, using an extracephalic electrode as a genuine neutral reference (as opposed to the classical \"bi-cephalic\" tDCS montages which deliver bi-polar stimulation of the brain) would help to comfort the conclusions of several modern studies regarding the spatial location and polarity of tDCS. On the other hand, using an extracephalic reference electrode may impact differently on a given cortical target due to the change of direct current flow direction; this may enlarge the potential interventions with tDCS.", "pages": "38"}, {"volume": "103", "title": "Task-dependent modulation of inputs to proximal upper limb following transcranial direct current stimulation of primary motor cortex.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11135281", "authors": ["Bradnam, LV", "Stinear, CM", "Lewis, GN", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Whereas the respiratory frequency decreased mildly over time and the blood pressure increased steadily, there was no differential impact of real (anodal or cathodal) versus sham tDCS.

This study assessed whether c-tDCS would have similar effects on ipsi- and contralateral M1 projections to a proximal upper limb muscle. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of left M1 was used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the left and right infraspinatus (INF) muscle immediately before and after c-tDCS of left M1, and at 20 and 40 min, post-c-tDCS. TMS was delivered as participants preactivated each INF in isolation (left, right) or both INF together (bilateral). After c-tDCS, ipsilateral MEPs in left INF and contralateral MEPs in right INF were suppressed in the left task but not in the bilateral or right tasks, indicative of task-dependent modulation. Ipsilateral silent period duration in the left INF was reduced after c-tDCS, indicative of altered transcallosal inhibition.

Preliminary evidence indicates that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the temporo-parietal area might reduce tinnitus. tDCS studies of the prefrontal cortex have been successful in reducing depression, impulsiveness and pain. Recently, it was shown that the prefrontal cortex is important for the integration of sensory and emotional aspects of tinnitus. As such, frontal tDCS might suppress tinnitus as well. In an open label study, a total of 478 tinnitus patients received bilateral tDCS on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (448 patients anode right, cathode left and 30 anode left, cathode right) for 20 min. Treatment effects were assessed with visual analogue scale for tinnitus intensity and distress. No tinnitus-suppressing effect was found for tDCS with left anode and right cathode. Analyses show that tDCS with right anode and left cathode modulates tinnitus perception in 29.9% of the tinnitus patients. For these responders a significant reduction was found for both tinnitus-related distress and tinnitus intensity. In addition, the amount of suppression for tinnitus-related distress is moderated by an interaction between tinnitus type and tinnitus laterality. This was, however, not the case for tinnitus intensity. Our study supports the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of tinnitus.", "pages": "38"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Spinal DC stimulation in humans modulates post-activation depression of the H-reflex depending on current polarity.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "12686266", "authors": ["Winkler, T", "Hering, P", "Straube, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Because we are interested in non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation as an adjuvant to post-stroke walking therapy, we applied direct current stimulation (tDCS) preferentially to either the left or right lower limb motor cortex (M1) in two separate sessions and assessed the resulting modulation in both cortices.", "pages": "38"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Brain transcranial direct current stimulation modulates motor excitability in mice.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "14211693", "authors": ["Cambiaghi, M", "Velikova, S", "Gonzalez-Rosa, JJ", "Cursi, M", "Comi, G", "Leocani, L"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "We hypothesized that tDCS applied preferentially to one lower limb M1 of healthy subjects would induce between-hemisphere opposite sign modulation.", "pages": "38"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Quality assessment and comparison of evidence for electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for schizophrenia: a systematic meta-review.", "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "14211694", "authors": ["Matheson, SL", "Green, MJ", "Loo, C", "Carr, VJ"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Schizophrenia research", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with the coil offset 2 cm either side of vertex was used to assess the percent change in rectified motor evoked potential (MEP) area recorded bilaterally from vastus lateralis (VL) and tibialis anterior (TA) of 10 subjects during weak tonic contraction.", "pages": "38"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Brain switches utilitarian behavior: does gender make the difference?", "issue": "1", "pmid": "14677403", "authors": ["Fumagalli, M", "Vergari, M", "Pasqualetti, P", "Marceglia, S", "Mameli, F", "Ferrucci, R", "Mrakic-Sposta, S", "Zago, S", "Sartori, G", "Pravettoni, G", "Barbieri, S", "Cappa, S", "Priori, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "ANOVA revealed an up-regulation of the target cortex and a down-regulation of the non-target cortex (p = 0.001) and no effects of hemisphere (left, right) or muscle (TA, VL).
