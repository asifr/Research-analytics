Furthermore, under resting-state conditions several spatial patterns have been identified that resemble functional systems involved in cognitive functions.

In addition, in resting-state conditions some brain areas engaged in focused attention (such as the anticorrelated network, AN) show a strong negative correlation with DMN; as task demand increases, AN activity rises, and DMN activity falls.", "pages": "252-63"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in treatment resistant depression: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "11906227", "authors": ["Palm, U", "Schiller, C", "Fintescu, Z", "Obermeier, M", "Keeser, D", "Reisinger, E", "Pogarell, O", "Nitsche, MA", "M\u00f6ller, HJ", "Padberg, F"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "We combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate these brain network dynamics.", "pages": "252-63"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Modulation of cortical activity after anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the lower limb motor cortex: a functional MRI study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "7584893", "authors": ["Kim, CR", "Kim, DY", "Kim, LS", "Chun, MH", "Kim, SJ", "Park, CH"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Ten healthy young volunteers underwent four blocks of resting-state fMRI (10-minutes), each of them immediately after 20 minutes of sham or active tDCS (2 mA), on two different days.
