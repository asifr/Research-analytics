Participants performed a contrast detection task on two consecutive days. Each session consisted of a baseline measurement followed by measurements made during active or sham stimulation. On the first day, one group received anodal stimulation to primary visual cortex (V1), while another received cathodal stimulation. Stimulation polarity was reversed for these groups on the second day. The third (control) group of subjects received sham stimulation on both days. No improvements or decrements in contrast sensitivity relative to the same-day baseline were observed during real tDCS, nor was any within-session learning trend observed. However, task performance improved significantly from Day 1 to Day 2 for the participants who received cathodal tDCS on Day 1 and for the sham group. No such improvement was found for the participants who received anodal stimulation on Day 1, indicating that anodal tDCS blocked overnight consolidation of visual learning, perhaps through engagement of inhibitory homeostatic plasticity mechanisms or alteration of the signal-to-noise ratio within stimulated cortex. These results show that applying tDCS to the visual cortex can modify consolidation of visual learning.", "pages": "1234-9"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation affects seizures and cognition in fully amygdala-kindled rats.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "23562065", "authors": ["Kamida, T", "Kong, S", "Eshima, N", "Fujiki, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a new non-invasive brain stimulation technique, on amygdala-kindled rats.

Furthermore, the effects of cathodal tDCS on cognitive function were also studied by a water maze test (WMT) two days after the last tDCS session. Cathodal tDCS treatment significantly improved the seizure stage and decreased ADD together with elevated ADT one day after the last tDCS session. The treatment also showed significant improvement in the performance of WMT. The findings suggest that cathodal tDCS has anticonvulsive after-effects last at least for one day on the amygdale-kindled rats and positively affects cognitive performance.", "pages": "1234-9"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Impaired Motor Cortex Responses in Non-Psychotic First-Degree Relatives of Schizophrenia Patients: A Cathodal tDCS Pilot Study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23545473", "authors": ["Hasan, A", "Misewitsch, K", "Nitsche, MA", "Gruber, O", "Padberg, F", "Falkai, P", "Wobrock, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia has recently been described as a disorder of impaired plasticity and dysconnectivity. Several lines of evidence suggest that alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission underlie different symptom domains of schizophrenia. Little is known about the impact of genetic liability on cortical plasticity and connectivity in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: To compare N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent cortical plasticity and connectivity in schizophrenia patients and unaffected first-degree relatives to that in healthy subjects. METHODS: Cortical plasticity can be induced in the motor cortex with cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Animal and human research indicates that this long-term depression-like plasticity (LTD-like) is NMDAR dependent, and that these plasticity shifts can last for several hours. tDCS-induced plasticity was assessed by measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) generated by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to both hemispheres in healthy controls, chronically ill schizophrenia patients and unaffected first-degree relatives. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, both first-degree relatives and schizophrenia patients showed abolished motor-cortical LTD-like plasticity of the stimulated hemisphere. On the non-stimulated hemisphere, plasticity was again abolished in schizophrenia patients, whereas first-degree relatives had a reversed plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Non-psychotic and clinically unaffected first-degree relatives showed an alteration and a reversal of LTD-like cortical plasticity, indicating functional alterations of glutamatergic transmission as a result of a genetic liability for developing schizophrenia. These results provide new evidence for the association between plasticity dysregulation and functional cortical connectivity, and the importance of these networks in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.", "pages": "1234-9"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Treatments in context: transcranial direct current brain stimulation as a potential treatment in pediatric psychosis.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "23545058", "authors": ["David, CN", "Rapoport, JL", "Gogtay, N"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Expert review of neurotherapeutics", "abstract": "Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a chronic, severe form of schizophrenia, and is typically treatment resistant.

The pathological processes following stroke may provide an exemplary system to investigate how tDCS promotes neuronal plasticity and functional recovery. Changes in synaptic function after stroke, such as reduced excitability, formation of aberrant connections, and deregulated plastic modifications, have been postulated to impede recovery from stroke. However, if tDCS could counteract these negative changes by influencing the system's neurophysiology, it would contribute to the formation of functionally meaningful connections and the maintenance of existing pathways. This paper is aimed at providing a review of underlying mechanisms of tDCS and its application to stroke. In addition, to maximize the effectiveness of tDCS in stroke rehabilitation, future research needs to determine the optimal stimulation protocols and parameters. We discuss how stimulation parameters could be optimized based on electrophysiological activity. In particular, we propose that cortical synchrony may represent a biomarker of tDCS efficacy to indicate communication between affected areas. Understanding the mechanisms by which tDCS affects the neural substrate after stroke and finding ways to optimize tDCS for each patient are key to effective rehabilitation approaches.", "pages": "1234-9"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Clinical effectiveness of primary and secondary headache treatment by transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "21820308", "authors": ["Pinchuk, D", "Pinchuk, O", "Sirbiladze, K", "Shugar, O"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) consist in the application of electrical current of small intensity through the scalp, able to modulate perceptual and motor learning, probably by changing brain excitability. We investigated the effects of these transcranial electrical stimulation techniques in the early and later stages of visuomotor learning, as well as associated brain activity changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We applied anodal and cathodal tDCS, low-frequency and high-frequency tRNS (lf-tRNS, 0.1-100 Hz; hf-tRNS 101-640 Hz, respectively) and sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) during the first 10 minutes of a visuomotor learning paradigm and measured performance changes for 20 minutes after stimulation ceased. Functional imaging scans were acquired throughout the whole experiment. Cathodal tDCS and hf-tRNS showed a tendency to improve and lf-tRNS to hinder early learning during stimulation, an effect that remained for 20 minutes after cessation of stimulation in the late learning phase. Motor learning-related activity decreased in several regions as reported previously, however, there was no significant modulation of brain activity by tDCS. In opposition to this, hf-tRNS was associated with reduced motor task-related-activity bilaterally in the frontal cortex and precuneous, probably due to interaction with ongoing neuronal oscillations. This result highlights the potential of lf-tRNS and hf-tRNS to differentially modulate visuomotor learning and advances our knowledge on neuroplasticity induction approaches combined with functional imaging methods.", "pages": "1234-9"}]
