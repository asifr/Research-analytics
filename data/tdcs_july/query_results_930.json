Lateral electrical stimulation of the motor cortex preferentially activates the axons of corticospinal neurones in the subcortical white matter, and evokes a D-wave in pyramidal tract. The way of activation of corticospinal neurones using magnetic stimulation depends on the direction of the electrical current induced in the brain and on the shape of the coil. Monophasic magnetic stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil inducing posterior-anterior current in the brain activates corticospinal neurones trans-synaptically recruiting an 11-wave, with later I-waves appearing in sequence at higher intensities and a D-wave at very high intensities. If the induced current is rotated to the anterior-posterior direction late I-waves are preferentially recruited and when a D-wave is recruited, it has a later onset than the electrical D-wave, suggesting an activation nearer the cell body of the pyramidal neurones. A latero-medial induced current activates both corticospinal axons at the same point as electrical stimulation evoking a D wave and cortico-cortical axons evoking I-waves. A nonfocal large circular coil centered at the vertex is capable of activating pyramidal neurones both at the initial segment and trans-synaptically evoking a D wave with a longer latency than the electrical D-wave and I-waves. Using a biphasic magnetic stimulation, both phases of the biphasic pulse are capable of activating descending motor output and the pattern of recruitment of descending activity depends on the intensity of the stimulus and the relative threshold of each volley to each direction of current flow.", "pages": "143-50"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Pulse configuration-dependent effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on visual perception.", "issue": "17", "pmid": "12488802", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Kincses, TZ", "Nitsche, MA", "Bartfai, O", "Demmer, I", "Sommer, M", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique for direct stimulation of the neocortex. In the last two decades it is successfully applied in the study of motor and sensory physiology. TMS uses the indirect induction of electrical fields in the brain generated by intense changes of magnetic fields applied to the scalp. It encompasses two widely used waveform configurations: mono-phasic magnetic pulses induce a single current in the brain while biphasic pulses induce at least two currents of inverse direction. As has been shown for the motor cortex, efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may depend on pulse configuration. In order to clarify this question with regard to visual perception, static contrast sensitivities (sCS) were evaluated before, during, immediately after and 10 minutes after monophasic and biphasic low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS applied to the occipital cortex of 15 healthy subjects. The intensity of stimulation was the phosphene threshold of each individual subject. Using 4 c/d spatial frequency, significant sCS loss was found during and immediately after 10 min of monophasic stimulation, while biphasic stimulation resulted in no significant effect. Ten minutes after the end of stimulation, the sCS values were at baseline level again. However, reversed current flow direction resulted in an increased efficacy of biphasic and decreased efficacy of monophasic stimulation. Our results are in agreement with previous findings showing that primary visual functions, such as contrast detection, can be transiently altered by low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation. However the effect of modulation significantly depends on the current waveform and direction.", "pages": "143-50"}, {"volume": "4 Suppl 1", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation: a new treatment for depression?", "issue": "", "pmid": "12479691", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Bipolar disorders", "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, new methods have been developed that have allowed scientists to visualize the human brain in action. Initially positron emission tomography (PET) and now functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are causing a paradigm shift in psychiatry and the neurosciences. Psychiatry is abandoning the pharmacological model of 'brain as soup', used for much of the past 20 years. Instead, there is new realization that both normal and abnormal behavior arise from chemical processes that occur within parallel distributed networks in specific brain regions. Many of these pathological circuits are becoming well characterized, in disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease, to obsessive-compulsive disorder, to depression. Most recently, there has been an explosion of new techniques that allow for direct stimulation of these brain circuits, without the need for open craniotomy and neurosurgical ablation. The techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This review will describe these new tools, and overview their current and future potential for research and clinical neuropsychiatric use. The psychiatry of the future will be better grounded in a firm understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology (as well as pharmacology). These brain stimulation tools, or their next iterations, will play an ever-larger role in clinical neuropsychiatric practice.", "pages": "143-50"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "New methods of minimally invasive brain modulation as therapies in psychiatry: TMS, MST, VNS and DBS.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "12455803", "authors": ["George, MS"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed", "abstract": "Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces persisting excitability changes in the human motor cortex. These plastic excitability changes are selectively controlled by the polarity, duration and current strength of stimulation. To reveal the underlying mechanisms of direct current (DC)-induced neuroplasticity, we combined tDCS of the motor cortex with the application of Na(+)-channel-blocking carbamazepine (CBZ) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist dextromethorphan (DMO). Monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), motor cortical excitability changes of up to 40% were achieved in the drug-free condition. Increase of cortical excitability could be selected by anodal stimulation, and decrease by cathodal stimulation. Both types of excitability change lasted several minutes after cessation of current stimulation. DMO suppressed the post-stimulation effects of both anodal and cathodal DC stimulation, strongly suggesting the involvement of NMDA receptors in both types of DC-induced neuroplasticity. In contrast, CBZ selectively eliminated anodal effects. Since CBZ stabilizes the membrane potential voltage-dependently, the results reveal that after-effects of anodal tDCS require a depolarization of membrane potentials. Similar to the induction of established types of short- or long-term neuroplasticity, a combination of glutamatergic and membrane mechanisms is necessary to induce the after-effects of tDCS. On the basis of these results, we suggest that polarity-driven alterations of resting membrane potentials represent the crucial mechanisms of the DC-induced after-effects, leading to both an alteration of spontaneous discharge rates and to a change in NMDA-receptor activation.", "pages": "143-50"}, {"volume": "125", "title": "Pharmacological approach to the mechanisms of transcranial DC-stimulation-induced after-effects of human motor cortex excitability.", "issue": "Pt 10", "pmid": "12244081", "authors": ["Liebetanz, D", "Nitsche, MA", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Modulation of cerebral excitability is thought to be one mechanism underlying the pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, depression, and dystonia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been tested for several years as a nonpharmacological, noninvasive method of directly influencing patients' cortical functions. We present an overview of the more easily performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with weak current, which produces distinctly more pronounced changes in excitability than rTMS. The basic underlying mechanism is a shift in the resting membrane potential towards either hyper- or depolarisation, depending on stimulation polarity. This in turn leads to changes in the excitability of cortical neurons. Anodic stimulation increases cortical excitability, while cathodic stimulation decreases it. These changes persist after the end of stimulation if the stimulation lasts long enough, i.e., at least several minutes. The duration of this aftereffect can be controlled through the duration and intensity of the stimulation.
