PTSD is characterized by hyperarousal, intrusive thoughts, exaggerated startle response, flashbacks, nightmares, sleep disturbances, emotional numbness, and persistent avoidance of trauma-associated stimuli. The efficacy of available treatments for PTSD may result in part from relief of associated depressive and anxiety-related symptoms in addition to treatment of core symptoms that derive from reexperiencing, numbing, and hyperarousal. Diverse, heterogeneous mechanisms of action and the ability to act broadly or very locally may enable brain stimulation devices to address PTSD core symptoms in more targeted ways. To achieve this goal, specific theoretical bases derived from novel, well-designed research protocols will be necessary. Brain stimulation devices include both long-used and new electrical and magnetic devices. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) have both been in use for decades; transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been developed recently, over approximately the past twenty years. The efficacy of brain stimulation has been demonstrated as a treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders such as anxiety (CES), depression (ECT, CES, rTMS, VNS, DBS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (DBS), essential tremor, dystonia (DBS), epilepsy (DBS, VNS), Parkinson Disease (DBS), pain (CES), and insomnia (CES). To date, limited data on brain stimulation for PTSD offer only modest guidance. ECT has shown some efficacy in reducing comorbid depression in PTSD patients but has not been demonstrated to improve most core PTSD symptoms. CES and VNS have shown some efficacy in reducing anxiety, findings that may suggest possible utility in relieving PTSD-associated anxiety. Treatment of animal models of PTSD with DBS suggests potential human benefit. Additional research and novel treatment options for PTSD are urgently needed. The potential usefulness of brain stimulation in treating PTSD deserves further exploration.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Time course of the induction of homeostatic plasticity generated by repeated transcranial direct current stimulation of the human motor cortex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10855761", "authors": ["Fricke, K", "Seeber, AA", "Thirugnanasambandam, N", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Several mechanisms have been proposed that control the amount of plasticity in neuronal circuits and guarantee dynamic stability of neuronal networks. Homeostatic plasticity suggests that the ease with which a synaptic connection is facilitated/suppressed depends on the previous amount of network activity. We describe how such homeostatic-like interactions depend on the time interval between two conditioning protocols and on the duration of the preconditioning protocol. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to produce short-lasting plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy humans. In the main experiment, we compared the aftereffect of a single 5-min session of anodal or cathodal tDCS with the effect of a 5-min tDCS session preceded by an identical 5-min conditioning session administered 30, 3, or 0 min beforehand. Five-minute anodal tDCS increases excitability for about 5 min. The same duration of cathodal tDCS reduces excitability. Increasing the duration of tDCS to 10 min prolongs the duration of the effects. If two 5-min periods of tDCS are applied with a 30-min break between them, the effect of the second period of tDCS is identical to that of 5-min stimulation alone. If the break is only 3 min, then the second session has the opposite effect to 5-min tDCS given alone. Control experiments show that these shifts in the direction of plasticity evolve during the 10 min after the first tDCS session and depend on the duration of the first tDCS but not on intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The results are compatible with a time-dependent \"homeostatic-like\" rule governing the response of the human motor cortex to plasticity probing protocols.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "209", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation enhances fine motor control of the hemiparetic ankle: implications for rehabilitation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10870367", "authors": ["Madhavan, S", "Weber, KA", "Stinear, JW"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental brain research. Experimentelle Hirnforschung. Exp\u00e9rimentation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale", "abstract": "We set out to answer two questions with this study: 1. Can stroke patients improve voluntary control of their paretic ankle by practising a visuo-motor ankle-tracking task? 2. Are practice effects enhanced with non-invasive brain stimulation? A carefully selected sample of chronic stroke patients able to perform the experimental task attended three data collection sessions. Facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied in a random order over the lower limb primary motor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere or the non-lesioned hemisphere or sham stimulation was delivered over the lesioned hemisphere. In each session, tDCS was applied as patients practiced tracking a sinusoidal waveform for 15\u00a0min using dorsiflexion-plantarflexion movements of their paretic ankle. The difference in tracking error prior to, and after, the 15\u00a0min of practice was calculated. A practice effect was revealed following sham stimulation, and this effect was enhanced with tDCS applied over the lesioned hemisphere. The practice effect observed following sham stimulation was eliminated by tDCS applied over the non-lesioned hemisphere. The study provides the first evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation applied to the lesioned motor cortex of moderate- to well-recovered stroke patients enhances voluntary control of the paretic ankle. The results provide a basis for examining whether this enhanced ankle control can be induced in patients with greater impairments and whether enhanced control of a single or multiple lower limb joints improves hemiparetic gait patterns.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in adolescent and adult Rasmussen's encephalitis.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11522258", "authors": ["San-Juan, D", "Calc\u00e1neo, Jde D", "Gonz\u00e1lez-Arag\u00f3n, MF", "Berm\u00fadez Maldonado, L", "Avell\u00e1n, AM", "Argumosa, EV", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "Rasmussen's encephalitis is a rare, progressive inflammatory disease that typically affects one cerebral hemisphere and causes intractable partial-onset seizures. Currently, the only effective therapy is hemispherectomy; however, this procedure is associated with irreversible neurological deficits. Novel therapeutic approaches to this condition are therefore necessary. One possible option that has not yet been extensively studied is electrical cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (cTDCS). We describe the cases of two patients with atypical-onset Rasmussen's encephalitis who underwent cTDCS at 1- and 2-mA intensity for 60 minutes in four sessions (on days 0, 7, 30, and 60). No complications were recorded during their therapy. At follow-up evaluations 6 and 12 months later, one patient had a significant reduction in seizure frequency and one was seizure free. Additionally, both patients had improved levels of alertness and language. This is the first time that cTDCS has been applied in serial sessions to treat Rasmussen's encephalitis to avoid or delay surgical treatment.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Nicotinergic impact on focal and non-focal neuroplasticity induced by non-invasive brain stimulation in non-smoking humans.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11691703", "authors": ["Thirugnanasambandam, N", "Grundey, J", "Adam, K", "Drees, A", "Skwirba, AC", "Lang, N", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Nicotine improves cognitive performance and modulates neuroplasticity in brain networks. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced behavioral changes have been sparsely studied, especially in humans. Global cholinergic activation focuses on plasticity in humans. However, the specific contribution of nicotinic receptors to these effects is unclear. Henceforth, we explored the impact of nicotine on non-focal neuroplasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and focal, synapse-specific plasticity induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS) in healthy non-smoking individuals. Forty-eight subjects participated in the study. Each subject received placebo and nicotine patches combined with one of the stimulation protocols to the primary motor cortex in different sessions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were recorded as a measure of corticospinal excitability until the evening of the second day following the stimulation. Nicotine abolished or reduced both PAS- and tDCS-induced inhibitory neuroplasticity. Non-focal facilitatory plasticity was also abolished, whereas focal facilitatory plasticity was slightly prolonged by nicotine. Thus, nicotinergic influence on facilitatory, but not inhibitory plasticity mimics that of global cholinergic enhancement. Therefore, activating nicotinic receptors has clearly discernable effects from global cholinergic activation. These nicotine-generated plasticity alterations might be important for the effects of the drug on cognitive function.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation: enhancing motor and cognitive functions in healthy old subjects.", "issue": "", "pmid": "12114003", "authors": ["Zimerman, M", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "abstract": "Healthy aging is accompanied by changes in cognitive and motor functions that result in impairment of activities of daily living. This process involves a number of modifications in the brain and is associated with metabolic, structural, and physiological changes; some of these serving as adaptive responses to the functional declines. Up to date there are no universally accepted strategies to ameliorate declining functions in this population. An essential basis to develop such strategies is a better understanding of neuroplastic changes during healthy aging. In this context, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current or transcranial magnetic stimulation, provide an attractive option to modulate cortical neuronal assemblies, even with subsequent changes in neuroplasticity. Thus, in the present review we discuss the use of these techniques as a tool to study underlying cortical mechanisms during healthy aging and as an interventional strategy to enhance declining functions and learning abilities in aged subjects.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Enhancement of precise hand movement by transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12559652", "authors": ["Matsuo, A", "Maeoka, H", "Hiyamizu, M", "Shomoto, K", "Morioka, S", "Seki, K"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the precise nondominant hand movement was investigated by applying anodal stimulation over the right primary motor cortex.

A circle-drawing task was performed before, immediately after, and at 30 min after 20 min of 1 mA anodal or sham tDCS. Anodal tDCS, compared with sham stimulation, significantly improved the circle-drawing task compared with sham stimulation. The deviation area and path length of the task were significantly decreased after anodal tDCS application and were further enhanced at 30 min after stimulation. These results suggest that anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex enhances the precise movement of the nondominant hand for 30 min in healthy participants.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in different current directions activates separate cortical circuits.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12742675", "authors": ["Ni, Z", "Charab, S", "Gunraj, C", "Nelson, AJ", "Udupa, K", "Yeh, IJ", "Chen, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the primary motor cortex (M1) produces a series of corticospinal descending waves, with a direct (D) wave followed by several indirect (I) waves. TMS inducing posterior-anterior (PA) current in the brain predominantly recruits the early I1-wave, whereas anterior-posterior (AP) directed current preferentially recruits the late I3-wave. However, it is not known whether I-waves elicited by different current directions are mediated by the same neuronal populations. We studied the neuronal mechanisms mediating I-waves by examining the influence of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) on various I-waves. SAI was tested with electrical median nerve stimulation at the wrist followed by TMS to the contralateral M1 at different current directions. Surface electromyograms and single motor units were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. SAI was weaker for the AP compared with that for the PA current direction. With increasing median nerve stimulation intensities, SAI increased for the PA direction but showed a U-shaped relationship for the AP direction. SAI produced more inhibition of late I-waves generated by PA than those generated by AP current direction. We conclude that late I-waves generated by PA and AP current directions are mediated by different neuronal mechanisms.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "227", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation induces polarity-specific changes of cortical blood perfusion in the rat.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12894034", "authors": ["Wachter, D", "Wrede, A", "Schulz-Schaeffer, W", "Taghizadeh-Waghefi, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Kutschenko, A", "Rohde, V", "Liebetanz, D"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces changes in cortical excitability and improves hand-motor function in chronic stroke.
