Beyond intracortical effects, functional imaging as well as behavioral studies are suggesting additional tDCS-driven alterations of subcortical areas, however, direct evidence for such effects is scarce. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortico-subcortical functional networks by seed functional connectivity analysis of different striatal and thalamic regions to prove tDCS-induced alterations of the cortico-striato-thalamic circuit. fMRI resting state data sets were acquired immediately before and after 10 min of bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode/anode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. To control for possible placebo effects, an additional sham stimulation session was carried out. Functional coupling between the left thalamus and the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) significantly increased following anodal stimulation over M1. Additionally, functional connectivity between the left caudate nucleus and parietal association cortices was significantly strengthened. In contrast, cathodal tDCS over M1 decreased functional coupling between left M1 and contralateral putamen. In summary, in this study, we show for the first time that tDCS modulates functional connectivity of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical circuits. Here we highlight that anodal tDCS over M1 is capable of modulating elements of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical functional motor circuit.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Task-specific effects of tDCS-induced cortical excitability changes on cognitive and motor sequence set shifting performance.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "21909415", "authors": ["Leite, J", "Carvalho, S", "Fregni, F", "Gon\u00e7alves, \u00d3F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "In this study, we tested the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on two set shifting tasks.

Thirty healthy subjects (fifteen per site) received anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the primary motor cortex (M1). We measured set shifting in both cognitive and motor tasks. The results show that both anodal and cathodal single session tDCS can modulate cognitive and motor tasks. However, an interaction was found between task and type of stimulation as anodal tDCS of DLPFC and M1 was found to increase performance in the cognitive task, while cathodal tDCS of DLPFC and M1 had the opposite effect on the motor task. Additionally, tDCS effects seem to be most evident on the speed of changing sets, rather than on reducing the number of errors or increasing the efficacy of irrelevant set filtering.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Cortico-Cortical Connectivity between Right Parietal and Bilateral Primary Motor Cortices during Imagined and Observed Actions: A Combined TMS/tDCS Study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17892479", "authors": ["Feurra, M", "Bianco, G", "Polizzotto, NR", "Innocenti, I", "Rossi, A", "Rossi, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Frontiers in neural circuits", "abstract": "Previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies showed functional connections between the parietal cortex (PC) and the primary motor cortex (M1) during tasks of different reaching-to-grasp movements.

Single pulse TMS of the right and left M1 during rest and during a motor imagery and an action observation task (i.e., an index-thumb pinch grip in both cases) was used to measure corticospinal excitability changes before and after conditioning of the right PC by 10\u2009min of cathodal, anodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Corticospinal excitability was indexed by the size of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI; target) and abductor digiti minimi muscle (control) muscles. Results showed selective ipsilateral effects on the M1 excitability, exclusively for motor imagery processes: anodal tDCS enhanced the MEPs' size from the FDI muscle, whereas cathodal tDCS decreased it. Only cathodal tDCS impacted corticospinal facilitation induced by action observation. Sham stimulation was always uneffective. These results suggest that motor imagery, differently from action observation, is sustained by a strictly ipsilateral parieto-motor cortex circuits.

Non-invasive brain stimulation by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may not only be useful as diagnostic research tools to explore the pathophysiology of neglect, but also for ameliorating its symptoms. Current approaches for modulating neglect non-invasively are mainly based on the neurophysiological concept of interhemispheric inhibition, which suggests a pathological overactivation of the contralesional hemisphere due to reduced inhibitory influences from the lesioned one. Within this framework, non-invasive brain stimulation mainly aims to inhibit the contralesional hemisphere to allow for rebalancing the system. However, facilitatory protocols for enhancing the ipsilesional neural circuitry might also prove useful. In this review, we discuss the contribution of non-invasive brain stimulation to current pathological concepts of neglect, the promising results of the proof-of-principle studies currently available as well as the specific aspects to be systematically investigated before broader clinical trials may eventually suggest a routine clinical application.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "225", "title": "Electrical stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) determines long-term effects in the recovery of speech apraxia in three chronic aphasics.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19494149", "authors": ["Marangolo, P", "Marinelli, CV", "Bonifazi, S", "Fiori, V", "Ceravolo, MG", "Provinciali, L", "Tomaiuolo, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that modulating cortical activity by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects the performance of both healthy and brain-damaged subjects.

Over 2 weeks, three aphasic subjects participated in a randomized double-blinded experiment involving intensive language training for their articulatory difficulties in two tDCS conditions. Each subject participated in five consecutive daily sessions of anodic tDCS (20 min, 1 mA) and sham stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (referred to as Broca's area) while they performed a repetition task. By the end of each week, a significant improvement was found in both conditions. However, all three subjects showed greater response accuracy in the anodic than in the sham condition. Moreover, results for transfer of treatment effects, although different across subjects, indicate a generalization of the recovery at the language test. Subjects 2 and 3 showed a significant improvement in oral production tasks, such as word repetition and reading, while Subjects 1 and 2 had an unexpected significant recovery in written naming and word writing under dictation tasks. At three follow-ups (1 week, 1 and 2 months after the end of treatment), response accuracy was still significantly better in the anodic than in sham condition, suggesting a long-term effect on the recovery of their articulatory gestures.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "The phase of ongoing oscillations mediates the causal relation between brain excitation and visual perception.", "issue": "33", "pmid": "19386757", "authors": ["Dugu\u00e9, L", "Marque, P", "VanRullen, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Why does neuronal activity in sensory brain areas sometimes give rise to perception, and sometimes not? Although neuronal noise is often invoked as the key factor, a portion of this variability could also be due to the history and current state of the brain affecting cortical excitability. Here we directly test this idea by examining whether the phase of prestimulus oscillatory activity is causally linked with modulations of cortical excitability and with visual perception. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over human visual cortex to induce illusory perceptions (phosphenes) while electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded. Subjects reported the presence or absence of an induced phosphene following a single pulse of TMS at perceptual threshold. The phase of ongoing alpha (\u223c10 Hz) oscillations within 400 ms before the pulse significantly covaried with the perceptual outcome. This effect was observed in occipital regions around the site of TMS, as well as in a distant frontocentral region. In both regions, we found a systematic relationship between prepulse EEG phase and perceptual performance: phosphene probability changed by \u223c15% between opposite phases. In summary, we provide direct evidence for a chain of causal relations between the phase of ongoing oscillations, neuronal excitability, and visual perception: ongoing oscillations create periodic \"windows of excitability,\" with sensory perception being more likely to occur at specific phases.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "The use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to facilitate recovery from post-stroke aphasia.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "21270784", "authors": ["Schlaug, G", "Marchina, S", "Wan, CY"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychology review", "abstract": "Aphasia is a common symptom after left hemispheric stroke. Neuroimaging techniques over the last 10-15\u00a0years have described two general trends: Patients with small left hemisphere strokes tend to recruit perilesional areas, while patients with large left hemisphere lesions recruit mainly homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been employed to facilitate recovery by stimulating lesional and contralesional regions. The majority of these brain stimulation studies have attempted to block homotopic regions in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to affect a presumed disinhibited right IFG (triangular portion). Other studies have used anodal or excitatory tDCS to stimulate the contralesional (right) fronto-temporal region or parts of the intact left IFG and perilesional regions to improve speech-motor output. It remains unclear whether the interhemispheric disinhibition model, which is the basis for motor cortex stimulation studies, also applies to the language system. Future studies could address a number of issues, including: the effect of lesion location on current density distribution, timing of the intervention with regard to stroke onset, whether brain stimulation should be combined with behavioral therapy, and whether multiple brain sites should be stimulated. A better understanding of the predictors of recovery from natural outcome studies would also help to inform study design, and the selection of clinically meaningful outcome measures in future studies.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Modulating the brain at work using noninvasive transcranial stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21146614", "authors": ["McKinley, RA", "Bridges, N", "Walters, CM", "Nelson, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "This paper proposes a shift in the way researchers currently view and use transcranial brain stimulation technologies. From a neuroscience perspective, the standard application of both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been mainly to explore the function of various brain regions. These tools allow for noninvasive and painless modulation of cortical tissue. In the course of studying the function of an area, many studies often report enhanced performance of a task during or following the stimulation. However, little follow-up research is typically done to further explore these effects. Approaching this growing pool of cognitive neuroscience literature with a neuroergonomics mindset (i.e., studying the brain at work), the possibilities of using these stimulation techniques for more than simply investigating the function of cortical areas become evident. In this paper, we discuss how cognitive neuroscience brain stimulation studies may complement neuroergonomics research on human performance optimization. And, through this discussion, we hope to shift the mindset of viewing transcranial stimulation techniques as solely investigatory basic science tools or possible clinical therapeutic devices to viewing transcranial stimulation techniques as interventional tools to be incorporated in applied science research and systems for the augmentation and enhancement of human operator performance.", "pages": "2499-508"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Prolonged visual memory enhancement after direct current stimulation in Alzheimer's disease.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10606011", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Ferrucci, R", "Mameli, F", "Martins, D", "Martins, O", "Vergari, M", "Tadini, L", "Scarpini, E", "Fregni, F", "Priori, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Immediately after patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) receive a single anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) session their memory performance improves.
