Transcranial magnetic (TMS) and direct current (tDCS) stimulation allow researchers to purposefully enhance or decrease excitability in focal areas of the brain. The purpose of this paper is to review information on the use of TMS and tDCS as research tools to facilitate motor memory formation, motor performance and motor learning in healthy volunteers. Studies implemented so far have mostly focused on the ability of TMS and tDCS to elicit relatively short lasting motor improvements and the mechanisms underlying these changes have been only partially investigated. Despite limitations including the scarcity of data, work that has been already accomplished raises the exciting hypothesis that currently available noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques could modulate motor learning and memory formation in healthy humans and potentially in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "pages": "363-369"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Boosting cortical activity at Beta-band frequencies slows movement in humans.", "issue": "19", "pmid": "19800236", "authors": ["Pogosyan, A", "Gaynor, LD", "Eusebio, A", "Brown, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Neurons have a striking tendency to engage in oscillatory activities. One important type of oscillatory activity prevalent in the motor system occurs in the beta frequency band, at about 20 Hz. It is manifest during the maintenance of tonic contractions and is suppressed prior to and during voluntary movement. This and other correlative evidence suggests that beta activity might promote tonic contraction, while impairing motor processing related to new movements. Hence, bursts of beta activity in the cortex are associated with a strengthening of the motor effects of sensory feedback during tonic contraction and with reductions in the velocity of voluntary movements. Moreover, beta activity is increased when movement has to be resisted or voluntarily suppressed. Here we use imperceptible transcranial alternating-current stimulation to entrain cortical activity at 20 Hz in healthy subjects and show that this slows voluntary movement. The present findings are the first direct evidence of causality between any physiological oscillatory brain activity and concurrent motor behavior in the healthy human and help explain how the exaggerated beta activity found in Parkinson's disease can lead to motor slowing in this illness.", "pages": "363-369"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Modulation of movement-associated cortical activation by transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "19026538", "authors": ["Stagg, CJ", "O'Shea, J", "Kincses, ZT", "Woolrich, M", "Matthews, PM", "Johansen-Berg, H"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is currently attracting increasing interest as a tool for neurorehabilitation. However, local and distant effects of tDCS on motor-related cortical activation patterns remain poorly defined, limiting the rationale for its use. Here we describe the results of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment designed to characterize local and distant effects on cortical motor activity following excitatory anodal stimulation and inhibitory cathodal stimulation. Fifteen right-handed subjects performed a visually cued serial reaction time task with their right hand in a 3-T MRI scanner both before and after 10 min of 1-mA tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1). Relative to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS led to short-lived activation increases in the M1 and the supplementary motor area (SMA) within the stimulated hemisphere. The increase in activation in the SMA with anodal stimulation was found also when directly comparing anodal with cathodal stimulation. Relative to sham stimulation, cathodal tDCS led to an increase in activation in the contralateral M1 and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), as well as an increase in functional connectivity between these areas and the stimulated left M1. These increases were also found when directly comparing cathodal with anodal stimulation. Significant within-session linear decreases in activation occurred in all scan sessions. The after-effects of anodal tDCS arose primarily from a change in the slope of these decreases. In addition, following sham stimulation compared with baseline, a between-session decrease in task-related activity was found. The effects of cathodal tDCS arose primarily from a reduction of this normal decrease.", "pages": "363-369"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Enhancing motor performance by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation in subacute stroke patients.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "19394268", "authors": ["Kim, DY", "Ohn, SH", "Yang, EJ", "Park, CI", "Jung, KJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists", "abstract": "To investigate whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhances motor performance in the paretic hand of subacute poststroke patients and how long the improvement persisted after the session.", "pages": "363-369"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "The neurobiology of deception: evidence from neuroimaging and loss-of-function studies.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "18396062", "authors": ["Abe, N"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current opinion in neurology", "abstract": "Ten subacute poststroke patients who suffered stoke within 12 wks were recruited for this single-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study.
