The contributors to this supplement present data and synthesize the extant literature on the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, optical imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation to study remodeling of cortical representation of motor and cognitive abilities after stroke and other etiologies of neurologic impairment. In general, the collective findings of these studies support use-dependent neuroplasticity as a mechanism of recovery and response to training. Brain imaging findings support the role of training effects on increased activation of brain regions ipsilateral to unilateral vascular lesions in facilitating recovery from stroke. The articles in this supplement also report the potential therapeutic application of stimulation techniques to enhance reorganization of function.", "pages": "S1"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "A randomized, sham-controlled, proof of principle study of transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "17133529", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Gimenes, R", "Valle, AC", "Ferreira, MJ", "Rocha, RR", "Natalle, L", "Bravo, R", "Rigonatti, SP", "Freedman, SD", "Nitsche, MA", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Boggio, PS"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Arthritis and rheumatism", "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by dysfunctional brain activity.

Two hundred and one patients aged from 7 to 82 years have been studied. In patients with focal brain damages at the acute stage (1-2 days after stroke), the anode and cathode were placed in the projection of a damaged center. In patients in \"autonomic status\" condition, the anode was placed both in frontal and parietal projection of the right hemisphere cortex and the cathode--on a mastoid of the right hemisphere. Strength of the current used was 300-500 mcA, time of one procedure--30-40 min. The whole treatment course involved no more than 15 procedures. Before the treatment, after 3-5 procedures of micropolarization and at the end of the treatment course, patients underwent computer tomography and electroencephalographic study. Transcranial micropolarization exerts a cerebroprotective effect and has a selective-systemic character due to an increase of neuronal structures activity boht directly in the area of the impact that manifests with the absence of brain edema and the reduction of the destruction locus by 10-15% just after three procedures and as in the other brain regions that results in the decrease of intensity of general cerebral symptoms. The micropolarization promotes restoration of the broken functional connections in central regulatory systems caused by improvement of interaction between neurons, structures and systems the results finally in restoration of central regulation of body's functions.", "pages": "S1"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Contribution of noninvasive cortical stimulation to the study of memory functions.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17023507", "authors": ["Floel, A", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Brain research reviews", "abstract": "We have recently shown that two techniques of brain stimulation - repetitive electrical stimulation (ES) (that mimics transcranial magnetic stimulation) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - modify the velocity of cortical spreading depression (CSD) significantly. Herein we aimed to study the effects of these two techniques combined on CSD. Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided into four groups according to the treatment: sham tDCS/sham ES, sham tDCS/1 Hz ES, anodal tDCS/1 Hz ES, cathodal tDCS/1 Hz ES. Our findings show that 1 Hz ES reduced CSD velocity, and this effect was modified by either anodal or cathodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS induced larger effects than cathodal tDCS. Hereby CSD velocity was actually increased significantly after anodal tDCS/1 Hz ES. Our results show that combining two techniques of brain stimulation can modify significantly the effects of ES alone on cortical excitability as measured by the neurophysiological parameter of cortical spreading depression and therefore provide important insights into the effects of this new approach of brain stimulation on cortical activity.", "pages": "S1"}]
