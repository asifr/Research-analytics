Decades of empirical research and clinical experience have led to new and improved brain stimulation techniques, but the mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy and side effects are poorly understood. As part of the ongoing research effort in tES, the value of computational models of transcranial electric current flow has been increasingly recognized, and a proliferation of modeling studies have been published. The complexity of these tES models ranges from simple sphere-based models of the head to high-resolution anatomical reconstructions based on head-image scans. This review provides an up-to-date description and comparison of existing computational models of tES (primarily tDCS and ECT), focusing on the modeling approaches adopted in previous studies and their significant finding.", "pages": "21-35"}, {"volume": "591", "title": "Evidence for long-lasting subcortical facilitation by transcranial direct current stimulation in the cat.", "issue": "Pt 13", "pmid": "23507876", "authors": ["Bolzoni, F", "Pettersson, LG", "Jankowska, E"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Abstract\u2002 The main aim of the study was to examine the effects of transcranial polarization on neurons in two descending motor systems, rubro- and reticulospinal. Anodal DC current was applied through an electrode in contact with the skull over the contralateral sensori-motor cortex, against an electrode placed between the skull and the ipsilateral temporal muscles in deeply anaesthetized cats. Its effects were estimated from changes in descending volleys evoked by electrical stimuli applied in the red nucleus (RN), medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF; to reticulospinal fibres) and the pyramidal tract (PT; to corticospinal or corticoreticular fibres). The descending volleys were recorded from the surface of the spinal cord at a cervical level. Rubrospinal neurones were activated either directly or indirectly, via interpositorubral fibres. Reticulospinal neurons were likewise activated directly and indirectly, via other reticulospinal or corticospinal fibres. Transcranial polarization facilitated transsynaptic activation of both rubrospinal and reticulospinal neurons, shortening the latency of the indirect descending volleys and/or increasing them, Direct activation of descending axons was much less affected. The facilitation of all subcortical neurons examined was potentiated by repeated applications of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and outlasted the polarization by at least 1-2 h, replicating tDCS effects on indirect activation of cortical neurons. The results indicate that the beneficial effects of tDCS on motor performance in humans may be due to more efficient activation of not only cortical but also subcortical neuronal systems. Combined actions of tDCS on cortical and subcortical neurones might thus further improve recovery of motor functions during rehabilitation after central injuries. 249/250.", "pages": "21-35"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for depression: Analysis of response using a three-factor structure of the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg depression rating scale.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23507370", "authors": ["Alonzo, A", "Chan, G", "Martin, D", "Mitchell, PB", "Loo, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an effective treatment for depression. However, no study to date has profiled the antidepressant effects of tDCS using items or factors on depression symptom severity rating scales. This could potentially provide information about the mechanisms by which tDCS achieves its antidepressant effects and also identify clinical predictors of response. METHODS: The present study analysed scores on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg depression rating scale (MADRS) from a randomised, sham-controlled trial of tDCS (Loo et al., 2012. British Journal of Psychiatry. 200, 52-59) using a three-factor model of MADRS items (Suzuki et al., 2005. Depression and Anxiety. 21, 95-97) encompassing dysphoria, retardation and vegetative symptoms. RESULTS: Participants in the active tDCS treatment group showed significant improvement in dysphoria while participants in the sham treatment group did not. While both groups showed improvement in retardation symptoms, improvement was significantly greater in the active tDCS group. Both groups also showed improvement in vegetative symptoms but there were no between-group differences. LIMITATIONS: Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to investigate the generalisability of results and whether the MADRS factor structure may change as a result of the specific treatment used. CONCLUSIONS: tDCS appears to be particularly effective in treating dysphoria and retardation, but not vegetative symptoms of depression. This may have implications for selection of types of depression most likely to respond to this treatment.", "pages": "21-35"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Computationally efficient simulation of electrical activity at cell membranes interacting with self-generated and externally imposed electric fields.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "23503026", "authors": ["Agudelo-Toro, A", "Neef, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "We present a computational method that implements a reduced set of Maxwell's equations to allow simulation of cells under realistic conditions: sub-micron cell morphology, a conductive non-homogeneous space and various ion channel properties and distributions.", "pages": "21-35"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Early optimization in finger dexterity of skilled pianists: implication of transcranial stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23496918", "authors": ["Furuya, S", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Altenm\u00fcller, E"], "year": "2013", "journal": "BMC neuroscience", "abstract": "While a reduced set of Maxwell's equations can be used to couple membrane currents to extra- and intracellular potentials, this approach is rarely taken, most likely because adequate computational tools are missing.
