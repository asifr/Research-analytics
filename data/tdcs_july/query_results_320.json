Specifically the \"inhibitory\" effect performed by tDCS (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) on DLPFC was analyzed by measuring alpha frequency band modulation when subjects processed congruous/incongruous object-related action. Thirty-four subjects performed the congruence detection task within a dynamic context (a sequence of four action frames), where the final one could be congruous or incongruous. The stimulation effect (cathode applied on the DLPFC and anode on the control site) was analyzed comparing the RTs (response times) and alpha modifications before and after the stimulation. A significant alpha increasing was found for incongruous actions in case of cathodic stimulation of DLPFC compared with the pre-stimulation condition. Moreover, RTs showed a significant reduction in response to incongruous condition after tDCS stimulation. It was suggested that the inhibition of DLPFC may limit the \"incongruence effect\" induced by the semantic anomaly. Secondly, the contribution of the frontal area for the semantic processing of action was demonstrated. Finally, tDCS influence on cortical oscillations was largely supported, showing alpha modulation induced by DLPFC inhibition.", "pages": "25-9"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Effects of motor cortex modulation and descending inhibitory systems on pain thresholds in healthy subjects.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "22515945", "authors": ["Reidler, JS", "Mendonca, ME", "Santana, MB", "Wang, X", "Lenkinski, R", "Motta, AF", "Marchand, S", "Latif, L", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society", "abstract": "Pain modulation can be achieved using neuromodulatory tools that influence various levels of the nervous system. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for instance, has been shown to reduce chronic pain when applied to the primary motor cortex. In contrast to this central neuromodulatory technique, diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) refers to endogenous analgesic mechanisms that decrease pain following the introduction of heterotopic noxious stimuli. We examined whether combining top-down motor cortex modulation using anodal tDCS with a bottom-up DNIC induction paradigm synergistically increases the threshold at which pain is perceived. The pain thresholds of 15 healthy subjects were assessed before and after administration of active tDCS, sham tDCS, cold-water-induced DNIC, and combined tDCS and DNIC. We found that both tDCS and the DNIC paradigm significantly increased pain thresholds and that these approaches appeared to have additive effects. Increase in pain threshold following active tDCS was positively correlated with baseline N-acetylaspartate in the cingulate cortex and negatively correlated with baseline glutamine levels in the thalamus as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These results suggest that motor cortex modulation may have a greater analgesic effect when combined with bottom-up neuromodulatory mechanisms, presenting new avenues for modulation of pain using noninvasive neuromodulatory approaches.", "pages": "25-9"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Enhancing lexical ambiguity resolution by brain polarization of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "22513342", "authors": ["Peretz, Y", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "abstract": "This article demonstrates that both noninvasive motor cortex modulation and a descending noxious inhibitory controls paradigm significantly increase pain thresholds in healthy subjects and appear to have an additive effect when combined.

Ambiguous prime words were presented followed by target words that could be associated to the dominant or subordinate meaning of the prime in a semantic relatedness task. Anodal stimulation of the right Wernicke's area significantly decreased response time (RTs) to subordinate but not dominant associations compared to sham stimulation. There was also a complementary trend of faster responses to dominant associations following anodal stimulation of Wernicke's area.

However, it is not known whether tDCS can enhance perceptual sensitivity independently of non-specific, arousal-linked changes in response bias, nor whether any such sensitivity benefit can be retained over time. We examined the influence of stimulation of the right inferior frontal cortex using tDCS on perceptual learning and retention in 37 healthy participants, using signal detection theory to distinguish effects on perceptual sensitivity (d') from response bias (\u00df). Anodal stimulation with 2 mA increased d', compared to a 0.1 mA sham stimulation control, with no effect on \u00df. On completion of training, participants in the active stimulation group had more than double the perceptual sensitivity of the control group. Furthermore, the performance enhancement was maintained for 24 hours. The results show that tDCS augments both skill acquisition and retention in a complex detection task and that the benefits are rooted in an improvement in sensitivity (d'), rather than changes in response bias (\u00df). Stimulation-driven acceleration of learning and its retention over 24 hours may result from increased activation of prefrontal cortical regions that provide top-down attentional control signals to object recognition areas.", "pages": "25-9"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Task-specific facilitation of cognition by cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the cerebellum.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "8833438", "authors": ["Pope, PA", "Miall, RC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "An inherent limitation of functional imaging studies is their correlational approach. More information about critical contributions of specific brain regions can be gained by focal transient perturbation of neural activity in specific regions with non-invasive focal brain stimulation methods. Functional imaging studies have revealed that tinnitus is related to alterations in neuronal activity of central auditory pathways. Modulation of neuronal activity in auditory cortical areas by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can reduce tinnitus loudness and, if applied repeatedly, exerts therapeutic effects, confirming the relevance of auditory cortex activation for tinnitus generation and persistence. Measurements of oscillatory brain activity before and after rTMS demonstrate that the same stimulation protocol has different effects on brain activity in different patients, presumably related to interindividual differences in baseline activity in the clinically heterogeneous study cohort. In addition to alterations in auditory pathways, imaging techniques also indicate the involvement of non-auditory brain areas, such as the fronto-parietal \"awareness\" network and the non-tinnitus-specific distress network consisting of the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdale. Involvement of the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region putatively reflects the relevance of memory mechanisms in the persistence of the phantom percept and the associated distress. Preliminary studies targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and the parietal cortex with rTMS and with transcranial direct current stimulation confirm the relevance of the mentioned non-auditory networks. Available data indicate the important value added by brain stimulation as a complementary approach to neuroimaging for identifying the neuronal correlates of the various clinical aspects of tinnitus.", "pages": "25-9"}]
