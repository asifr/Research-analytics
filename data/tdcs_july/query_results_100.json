We applied 10\u00a0min 1\u00a0mA anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) inside the bore of a 3\u00a0T MRI scanner to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 13 healthy volunteers (aged 19-28 yr) in a blinded, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Brain bioenergetics were measured from the left temporo-frontal region using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy before, during and for 20\u00a0min following tDCS. Brain pH rose during tDCS and remained elevated afterwards. Phosphomonoesters were significantly decreased while inorganic phosphate (Pi) also fell. Partial-least squares discriminant analysis of the data revealed two significantly different subject groups: one where phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP and Pi fell along with a larger increase in pH and one where PCr and ATP increased along with a smaller increase in pH and a slower and more sustained decrease in Pi. Group membership was predicted by baseline pH and ATP. We interpreted the effects of tDCS as driving two biochemical processes: cellular consumption of ATP causing hydrolysis of PCr via the creatine kinase reaction driving the increase in pH; synthesis of ATP and PCr by mitochondria with concomitant drop in Pi and phosphomonoester levels.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Anodal tDCS Applied during Strength Training Enhances Motor Cortical Plasticity.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23470308", "authors": ["Hendy, AM", "Kidgell, DJ"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Medicine and science in sports and exercise", "abstract": "Purpose: To assess the effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) on voluntary dynamic strength and cortical plasticity when applied during a three week strength training program for the wrist extensors. Methods: 30 right handed participants were randomly allocated to the tDCS, sham, or control group. The tDCS and sham group underwent three weeks of heavy load strength training of the right wrist extensors, with 20 min of a-tDCS (2 mA) or sham tDCS applied during training (double blinded). Outcome measures included voluntary dynamic wrist extension strength, muscle thickness, corticospinal excitability, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and silent period duration. Results: Maximal voluntary strength increased in both the tDCS and sham groups (14.89% and 11.17% respectively, both p < 0.001). There was no difference in strength gain between the two groups (p = 0.229), and no change in muscle thickness (p = 0.15). The tDCS group demonstrated an increase in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude at 15, 20 and 25% above active motor threshold, which was accompanied by a decrease in SICI during 50% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and 20% MVIC (all p < 0.05). Silent period decreased for both the tDCS and sham groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The application of a-tDCS in combination with strength training of the wrist extensors in a healthy population did not provide additional benefit for voluntary dynamic strength gains when compared with standard strength training. However, strength training with a-tDCS appears to differentially modulate cortical plasticity via increases in corticospinal excitability and decreases in SICI, which did not occur following strength training alone.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Is transcranial alternating current stimulation effective in modulating brain oscillations?", "issue": "2", "pmid": "23457586", "authors": ["Brignani, D", "Ruzzoli, M", "Mauri, P", "Miniussi, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising tool for modulating brain oscillations, as well as a possible therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of conclusive evidence on whether tACS is able to effectively affect cortical activity continues to limit its application. The present study aims to address this issue by exploiting the well-known inhibitory alpha rhythm in the posterior parietal cortex during visual perception and attention orientation. Four groups of healthy volunteers were tested with a Gabor patch detection and discrimination task. All participants were tested at the baseline and selective frequencies of tACS, including Sham, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, and 25 Hz. Stimulation at 6 Hz and 10 Hz over the occipito-parietal area impaired performance in the detection task compared to the baseline. The lack of a retinotopically organised effect and marginal frequency-specificity modulation in the detection task force us to be cautious about the effectiveness of tACS in modulating brain oscillations. Therefore, the present study does not provide significant evidence for tACS reliably inducing direct modulations of brain oscillations that can influence performance in a visual task.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "When anger leads to rumination: induction of relative right frontal cortical activity with transcranial direct current stimulation increases anger-related rumination.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16571739", "authors": ["Kelley, NJ", "Hortensius, R", "Harmon-Jones, E"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Psychological science", "abstract": "Anger is associated with various responses. Research on the neuroscience of anger has revealed that greater left than right frontal cortical activity is associated with angry approach-oriented responses, such as aggression, whereas greater right than left frontal cortical activity is associated with inhibited angry responses mixed with anxiety. In the current research, we extended these past studies by manipulating asymmetric frontal cortical activity using transcranial direct current stimulation and assessing its influence on ruminative responses to an interpersonal insult. Results revealed that self-reported rumination was greatest for participants who received a manipulated increase in relative right frontal cortical activity compared with those who received either a manipulated increase in relative left frontal cortical activity or sham stimulation. Taken together with past findings, the current results suggest that anger associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activity predicts approach-oriented aggressive action, whereas anger associated with greater relative right frontal cortical activity predicts inhibited rumination.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Brain stimulation modulates the autonomic nervous system, rating of perceived exertion and performance during maximal exercise.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16971533", "authors": ["Okano, AH", "Fontes, EB", "Montenegro, RA", "Farinatti, PD", "Cyrino, ES", "Li, LM", "Bikson, M", "Noakes, TD"], "year": "2013", "journal": "British journal of sports medicine", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The temporal and insular cortex (TC, IC) have been associated with autonomic nervous system (ANS) control and the awareness of emotional feelings from the body. Evidence shows that the ANS and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) regulate exercise performance. Non-invasive brain stimulation can modulate the cortical area directly beneath the electrode related to ANS and RPE, but it could also affect subcortical areas by connection within the cortico-cortical neural networks. This study evaluated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the TC on the ANS, RPE and performance during a maximal dynamic exercise. METHODS: Ten trained cyclists participated in this study (33\u00b19 years; 171.5\u00b15.8 cm; 72.8\u00b19.5 kg; 10-11 training years). After 20-min of receiving either anodal tDCS applied over the left TC (T3) or sham stimulation, subjects completed a maximal incremental cycling exercise test. RPE, heart rate (HR) and R-R intervals (as a measure of ANS function) were recorded continuously throughout the tests. Peak power output (PPO) was recorded at the end of the tests. RESULTS: With anodal tDCS, PPO improved by \u223c4% (anodal tDCS: 313.2\u00b129.9 vs 301.0\u00b119.8 watts: sham tDCS; p=0.043), parasympathetic vagal withdrawal was delayed (anodal tDCS: 147.5\u00b153.3 vs 125.0\u00b135.4 watts: sham tDCS; p=0.041) and HR was reduced at submaximal workloads. RPE also increased more slowly during exercise following anodal tDCS application, but maximal RPE and HR values were not affected by cortical stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that non-invasive brain stimulation over the TC modulates the ANS activity and the sensory perception of effort and exercise performance, indicating that the brain plays a crucial role in the exercise performance regulation.", "pages": "1-12"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Neuroplasticity-based brain stimulation interventions in the study and treatment of schizophrenia: a review.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17015233", "authors": ["Rajji, TK", "Rogasch, NC", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Canadian journal of psychiatry.

We searched PubMed and Scholars Portal using search terms related to schizophrenia, brain stimulation, and neuroplasticity. Various brain stimulation approaches simulating a range of experimental protocols that induce synaptic long-term potentiation or depression have been developed. By far, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been the most widely used in the field of schizophrenia. Its application has been associated with mixed results in treating treatment-resistant symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Compared to the other approaches, rTMS is probably the least similar to plasticity-inducing cellular paradigms. Other approaches, such as paired associative stimulation, theta-burst stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation, are in their incipient stages in the study and treatment of schizophrenia, with promising early results. Numerous brain stimulation approaches have been developed to treat resistant dimensions of schizophrenia.
