AREAS COVERED: this paper comprises a review of recent research in drug therapy for schizophrenia, particularly treatment-refractory schizophrenia, with a focus on research conducted between 2005 and June 2010. Databases that were searched include: Pubmed, CINAHL, Science Direct, Medline and Clinical Trials.gov. Primary search terms were 'treatment-refractory schizophrenia' and 'treatment-resistant schizophrenia', with cross reference to specific agents covered in this article. An objective perspective on current trends in pharmacotherapy for treatment-refractory schizophrenia. We review the available evidence and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of published data in this field.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which delivers weak polarizing direct currents to the cortex, is used to modulate cortical excitability. The nature of neuromodulation depends on the stimulation polarity: anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability while cathodal stimulation reduces it. It has been demonstrated that tDCS-induced brain modulations are associated with cognitive changes. In most paradigms tested, excitability-enhancing anodal tDCS proved beneficial to learning and memory processes, attention, and linguistic skills. In this context, tDCS appears to be a promising method to improve cognitive functions in patients with various neurological disorders, including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Exposure to brain polarization may help in specific and selective enhancement of adaptive patterns of activity, suppression of non-adaptive activation patterns, and balancing interhemispheric interactions.", "pages": "411-34"}]
