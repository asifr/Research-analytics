[{"volume": "2", "title": "Probing of Brain States in Real-Time: Introducing the ConSole Environment.", "issue": "", "pmid": "21716603", "authors": ["Hartmann, T", "Schulz, H", "Weisz, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "abstract": "Recent years have seen huge advancements in the methods available and used in neuroscience employing EEG or MEG. However, the standard approach is to average a large number of trials for experimentally defined conditions in order to reduce intertrial-variability, i.e., treating it as a source of \"noise.\" Yet it is now more and more accepted that trial-to-trial fluctuations bear functional significance, reflecting fluctuations of \"brain states\" that predispose perception and action. Such effects are often revealed in a pre-stimulus period, when comparing response variability to an invariant stimulus. However such offline analyses are disadvantageous as they are correlational by drawing conclusions in a post hoc-manner and stimulus presentation is random with respect to the feature of interest. A more direct test is to trigger stimulus presentation when the relevant feature is present. The current paper introduces Constance System for Online EEG (ConSole), a software package capable of analyzing ongoing EEG/MEG in real-time and presenting auditory and visual stimuli via internal routines. Stimulation via external devices (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation) or third-party software (e.g., PsyScope X) is possible by sending TTL-triggers. With ConSole it is thus possible to target the stimulation at specific brain states. In contrast to many available applications, ConSole is open-source. Its modular design enhances the power of the software as it can be easily adapted to new challenges and writing new experiments is an easy task. ConSole is already pre-equipped with modules performing standard signal processing steps. The software is also independent from the EEG/MEG system, as long as a driver can be written (currently two EEG systems are supported). Besides a general introduction, we present benchmark data regarding performance and validity of the calculations used, as well as three example applications of ConSole in different settings.

In recent studies, TDCS has been shown to improve learning when applied to the prefrontal cortex (e.g., Kincses et al. in Neuropsychologia 42:113-117, 2003; Clark et al. Neuroimage in 2010). The present study examined the effects of TDCS delivered at the beginning of training (novice) or after an hour of training (experienced) on participants' ability to detect cues indicative of covert threats. Participants completed two 1-h training sessions. During the first 30\u00a0min of each training session, either 0.1\u00a0mA or 2.0\u00a0mA of anodal TDCS was delivered to the participant. The anode was positioned near F8, and the cathode was placed on the upper left arm. Testing trials immediately followed training. Accuracy in classification of images containing and not-containing threat stimuli during the testing sessions indicated: (1) that mastery of threat detection significantly increased with training, (2) that anodal TDCS at 2\u00a0mA significantly enhanced learning, and (3) TDCS was significantly more effective in enhancing test performance when applied in novice learners than in experienced learners. The enhanced performance following training with TDCS persisted into the second session when TDCS was delivered early in training.", "pages": "36"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Brain energy consumption induced by electrical stimulation promotes systemic glucose uptake.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "16971533", "authors": ["Binkofski, F", "Loebig, M", "Jauch-Chara, K", "Bergmann, S", "Melchert, UH", "Scholand-Engler, HG", "Schweiger, U", "Pellerin, L", "Oltmanns, KM"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Controlled transcranial stimulation of the brain is part of clinical treatment strategies in neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, stroke, or Parkinson's disease.

Because hypothalamic adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels, which function as local energy sensors, are centrally involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, we tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) causes an excitation-induced transient neuronal energy depletion and thus influences systemic glucose homeostasis and related neuroendocrine mediators.", "pages": "36"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on human regional cerebral blood flow.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "12792019", "authors": ["Zheng, X", "Alsop, DC", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "In a crossover design testing 15 healthy male volunteers, we increased neuronal excitation by anodal tDCS versus sham and examined cerebral energy consumption with \u00b3\u00b9phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1%) in rCBF during stimulation, which returned to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive after-effects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area. Our results indicate that ASL may be an excellent tool to investigate the effects of tDCS and its stimulation parameters on brain activity.", "pages": "36"}, {"volume": "1403", "title": "Non-invasive electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB) modifies the resting-state network connectivity of the primary motor cortex: a proof of concept fMRI study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17284203", "authors": ["Alon, G", "Roys, SR", "Gullapalli, RP", "Greenspan, JD"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Focal dystonia in musicians (MD) is a task-specific movement disorder with a loss of voluntary motor control during instrumental playing.
