Postoperative pain control is an important factor in determining recovery time, hospital length of stay, and rehabilitation success. Several brain stimulation technologies including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have demonstrated promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions. The present study examined the effects of 4 sessions of tDCS on post-TKA pain and opioid consumption. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Forty patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomly assigned to receive a total of 80 minutes of real (n=20) or sham tDCS (n=20) with the anode over the knee representation of the motor strip (C1h or C2h corresponding to the target knee) and cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3; located by the EEG 10-20 System). Patient-controlled analgesia ( hydromorphone) use was tracked during the \u223c48 hours postsurgery. RESULTS:: Patients in the real tDCS group used an average of 6.6 mg (SD=5.3) of patient-controlled analgesia hydromorphone, whereas those in the sham group used 12.3 mg (SD=6.6; t37=2.93, P=0.006). Despite using less opioid medication, participants in the real tDCS group reported no pain exacerbation or worse mood with respect to those in the sham tDCS group. CONCLUSIONS:: Results from this pilot feasibility study suggest that tDCS may be able to reduce post-TKA opioid requirements. Although these results are preliminary, the data support further research in the area of adjunctive cortical stimulation in the management of postsurgical pain.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Physiological and modeling evidence for focal transcranial electrical brain stimulation in humans: a basis for high-definition tDCS.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23370061", "authors": ["Edwards, D", "Cortes, M", "Datta, A", "Minhas, P", "Wassermann, EM", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, low-cost, well-tolerated technique producing lasting modulation of cortical excitability. Behavioral and therapeutic outcomes of tDCS are linked to the targeted brain regions, but there is little evidence that current reaches the brain as intended. We aimed to: (1) validate a computational model for estimating cortical electric fields in human transcranial stimulation, and (2) assess the magnitude and spread of cortical electric field with a novel High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) scalp montage using a 4 \u00d7 1-Ring electrode configuration. In three healthy adults, Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) over primary motor cortex (M1) was delivered using the 4 \u00d7 1 montage (4 \u00d7 cathode, surrounding a single central anode; montage radius ~3 cm) with sufficient intensity to elicit a discrete muscle twitch in the hand. The estimated current distribution in M1 was calculated using the individualized MRI-based model, and compared with the observed motor response across subjects. The response magnitude was quantified with stimulation over motor cortex as well as anterior and posterior to motor cortex. In each case the model data were consistent with the motor response across subjects. The estimated cortical electric fields with the 4 \u00d7 1 montage were compared (area, magnitude, direction) for TES and tDCS in each subject. We provide direct evidence in humans that TES with a 4 \u00d7 1-Ring configuration can activate motor cortex and that current does not substantially spread outside the stimulation area. Computational models predict that both TES and tDCS waveforms using the 4 \u00d7 1-Ring configuration generate electric fields in cortex with comparable gross current distribution, and preferentially directed normal (inward) currents. The agreement of modeling and experimental data for both current delivery and focality support the use of the HD-tDCS 4 \u00d7 1-Ring montage for cortically targeted neuromodulation.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "6", "title": "The role of timing in the induction of neuromodulation in perceptual learning by transcranial electric stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "23369505", "authors": ["Pirulli, C", "Fertonani, A", "Miniussi, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Transcranial electric stimulation (tES) protocols are able to induce neuromodulation, offering important insights to focus and constrain theories of the relationship between brain and behavior.

The abnormal thickness of fat that exist in obese subjects may influence current delivery from scalp electrodes to the brain. MRI-derived Finite Element (FE) models of a morbidly obese subject were created with and without fat delineated. The inclusion of fat to the FE model reduced the effective volume of the relatively conductive skin. This led to greater current penetration to the cortical surface. Electric field was substantially greater (60%) in magnitude and a difference in the spatial profile was noted in the model with fat. Additional models testing the effect of varying fat conductivity revealed an inflection in current penetration as fat conductivity is varied. It was postulated that this may be due to a shunting effect both when the shell of fat surrounding the skull is too resistive for penetration and when the fat is so conductive as to lead current around rather than through the head. Precise FE tDCS model of obese patients requires the precise inclusion of fat.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation and EEG-based motor imagery BCI for upper limb stroke rehabilitation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "8375870", "authors": ["Ang, KK", "Guan, C", "Phua, KS", "Wang, C", "Teh, I", "Chen, CW", "Chew, E"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

In this study, we have investigated the effect of skull and white matter (WM) anisotropy on the induced electric field (EF) by tDCS in two different montages; one using a pair of clinically used rectangular pad electrodes and the other 4(cathodes)+1(anode) ring electrodes. Using a gyri-specific finite element (FE) head model, we simulated tDCS and investigated the radial and tangential components of the induced EF in terms of their distribution over the cortical surface besides the distribution of the transverse and longitudinal components within WM. The results show that the tangential component of the EF on the cortical surface seems to be the main cause of the cortical stimulation of tDCS. Also WM anisotropy seems to increase the dispersion of the transverse component of the EF that affects the dispersion of the EF magnitude within the WM region.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Electrode assembly design for transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: a FEM modeling study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "9254986", "authors": ["Kronberg, G", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...
