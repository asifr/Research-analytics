Electric field and 3D conduction current density were analyzed using 3D finite element method (FEM) formulated for a dc conduction problem. The electrode positions for minimal current injection were optimized by changing the Cartesian coordinate system into the spherical coordinate system and applying the (2+6) evolution strategy (ES) algorithm. Preliminary simulation studies applied to a standard three-layer head model demonstrated that the proposed approach is promising in enhancing the performance of tDCS.", "pages": "N219-25"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Limited impact of homeostatic plasticity on motor learning in humans.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "18394661", "authors": ["Kuo, MF", "Unger, M", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Neuroplasticity is the adaptive modification of network connectivity in response to environmental demands and has been identified as a major physiological correlate of learning. Since unrestricted neuroplastic modifications of network connectivity will result in a de-stabilization of the system, metaplastic modification rules have been proposed for keeping plastic connectivity changes within a useful dynamic range. In this connection, the modification threshold to achieve synaptic strengthening is thought to correlate negatively with the history of activity of the respective neurons, i.e. high previous activity enhances the threshold for synaptic strengthening and vice versa. However, the relevance of metaplasticity for actual learning processes has not been tested so far. We reduced or enhanced motor cortex excitability before performance of the serial reaction time task (SRTT), a sequential motor learning paradigm, and a reaction time task (RTT) by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). If homeostatic rules apply, excitability-diminishing cathodal tDCS should improve subsequent motor learning, especially if combined with the partial NMDA receptor-agonist d-cycloserine, which selectively enhances efficacy of active receptors, while excitability-enhancing anodal tDCS should reduce it. Only the results for anodal tDCS, when combined with d-cycloserine, were in accordance with the rules of homeostatic plasticity. We conclude that homeostatic plasticity, as tested here, has a limited influence on implicit sequential motor learning.", "pages": "N219-25"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease and dystonia.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "18394576", "authors": ["Wu, AD", "Fregni, F", "Simon, DK", "Deblieck, C", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are promising noninvasive cortical stimulation methods for adjunctive treatment of movement disorders. They avoid surgical risks and provide theoretical advantages of specific neural circuit neuromodulation. Neuromodulatory effects depend on extrinsic stimulation factors (cortical target, frequency, intensity, duration, number of sessions), intrinsic patient factors (disease process, individual variability and symptoms, state of medication treatment), and outcome measures. Most studies to date have shown beneficial effects of rTMS or tDCS on clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and support the notion of spatial specificity to the effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms. Stimulation parameters have varied widely, however, and some studies are poorly controlled. Studies of rTMS or tDCS in dystonia have provided abundant data on physiology, but few on clinical effects. Multiple mechanisms likely contribute to the clinical effects of rTMS and tDCS in movement disorders, including normalization of cortical excitability, rebalancing of distributed neural network activity, and induction of dopamine release. It remains unclear how to individually adjust rTMS or tDCS factors for the most beneficial effects on symptoms of PD or dystonia. Nonetheless, the noninvasive nature, minimal side effects, positive effects in preliminary clinical studies, and increasing evidence for rational mechanisms make rTMS and tDCS attractive for ongoing investigation.", "pages": "N219-25"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation with transcranial magnetic or direct current stimulation (TMS/tDCS)-From insights into human memory to therapy of its dysfunction.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "15509619", "authors": ["Sparing, R", "Mottaghy, FM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Methods (San Diego, Calif.)", "abstract": "Noninvasive stimulation of the brain by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has driven important discoveries in the field of human memory functions. Stand-alone or in combination with other brain mapping techniques noninvasive brain stimulation can assess issues such as location and timing of brain activity, connectivity and plasticity of neural circuits and functional relevance of a circumscribed brain area to a given cognitive task. In this emerging field, major advances in technology have been made in a relatively short period. New stimulation protocols and, especially, the progress in the application of tDCS have made it possible to obtain longer and much clearer inhibitory or facilitatory effects even after the stimulation has ceased. In this introductory review, we outline the basic principles, discuss technical limitations and describe how noninvasive brain stimulation can be used to study human memory functions in vivo.

In both groups, facilitatory preconditioning of left M1 with anodal tDCS increased the mean amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited in the contralateral hand, whereas inhibitory preconditioning with cathodal tDCS produced a decrease in amplitude. Following cathodal tDCS, a short train of low-intensity 5-Hz rTMS antagonized the suppression of the mean MEP amplitude in both groups. In contrast, the homeostatic effects of 5-Hz rTMS differed between groups when rTMS was given after anodal tDCS. In controls 5-Hz rTMS induced a marked decrease in MEP amplitudes, whereas in migraineurs rTMS induced only a modest decrease in MEP amplitudes, which were still facilitated after rTMS when compared with baseline amplitudes. These findings indicate that short-term homeostatic plasticity is altered in patients with visual aura between the attacks.", "pages": "N219-25"}]
