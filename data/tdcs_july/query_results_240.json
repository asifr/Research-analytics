Since noninvasive electrical brain stimulation is capable of inducing alterations in the human brain, these stimulation approaches might be attractive tools to modulate cognition. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters spontaneous cortical activity, while transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) are presumed to induce or interfere with oscillations of cortical networks. Via these mechanisms, the respective stimulation techniques have indeed been shown to modulate cognitive processes in a multitude of studies conducted during the last years. In this review, we will gather knowledge about the potential of noninvasive electrical brain stimulation to study and modify cognitive processes in healthy humans and discuss directions of future research.", "pages": "192-9"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Computational models of transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "22956646", "authors": ["Bikson, M", "Rahman, A", "Datta, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "During transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), controllable dose parameters are electrode number (typically 1 anode and 1 cathode), position, size, shape, and applied electric current. Because different electrode montages result in distinct brain current flow patterns across the brain, tDCS dose parameters can be adjusted, in an application-specific manner, to target or avoid specific brain regions. Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability \"under\" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications.\u00a0 In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy.", "pages": "192-9"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Investigating neuroplastic changes in the human brain induced by transcranial direct (tDCS) and alternating current (tACS) stimulation methods.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "22956645", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "Acute and chronic consumption of alcohol have direct effects on central nervous system by altering predominantly gamma-aminobutyric acidergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Abnormalities in these neurotransmitter systems can be demonstrated by changes in cortical excitability parameters assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Furthermore, integrated approaches utilizing TMS combined with electroencephalography (EEG) enable the evaluation of the focal effects of alcohol on the human cortex, providing useful information, different from that obtained using other functional brain imaging modalities. Alcohol was found to modulate EEG responses evoked by motor-cortex TMS, predominantly at the right prefrontal cortex, indicating that ethanol alters the functional connectivity between motor and prefrontal areas. Alcohol decreases amplitudes of EEG responses of anterior parts of the cortex after left prefrontal TMS, suggesting a decrease of prefrontal cortical excitability. High-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) revealed significant changes in short-term plasticity of the primary motor cortex after acute ethanol intake and in patients with chronic alcohol abuse. TMS findings also support the recently emerged theory that abnormal function of glutamate receptors plays a relevant role in the development of alcohol dependence and manifestation of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Finally, initial studies provide evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation) might represent a potential therapeutic tool to reduce alcohol craving. Future studies with larger sample size evaluating the clinical effects of these neuromodulatory approaches are required to confirm and extend the preliminary findings.", "pages": "192-9"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation in the functional evaluation of alcohol effects and in the treatment of alcohol craving: a review.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "22951276", "authors": ["Nardone, R", "Bergmann, J", "Christova, M", "Lochner, P", "Tezzon, F", "Golaszewski, S", "Trinka, E", "Brigo, F"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroscience research", "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a broad overview of models and technologies pertaining to transcranial current brain stimulation (tCS), a family of related noninvasive techniques including direct current (tDCS), alternating current (tACS), and random noise current stimulation (tRNS).

However, its neurobiological effects are still largely unknown. Electric fields are known to influence the migration of various cell types in vitro, but effects in vivo remain to be shown. Hypothesizing that tDCS might elicit the recruitment of cells to the cortex, we here studied the effects of tDCS in the rat brain in vivo. Adult Wistar rats (n\u200a=\u200a16) were randomized to either anodal or cathodal stimulation for either 5 or 10 consecutive days (500 \u00b5A, 15 min). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given systemically to label dividing cells throughout the experiment. Immunohistochemical analyses ex vivo included stainings for activated microglia and endogenous neural stem cells (NSC). Multi-session tDCS with the chosen parameters did not cause a cortical lesion. An innate immune response with early upregulation of Iba1-positive activated microglia occurred after both cathodal and anodal tDCS. The involvement of adaptive immunity as assessed by ICAM1-immunoreactivity was less pronounced. Most interestingly, only cathodal tDCS increased the number of endogenous NSC in the stimulated cortex. After 10 days of cathodal stimulation, proliferating NSC increased by \u223c60%, with a significant effect of both polarity and number of tDCS sessions on the recruitment of NSC. We demonstrate a pro-inflammatory effect of both cathodal and anodal tDCS, and a polarity-specific migratory effect on endogenous NSC in vivo. Our data suggest that tDCS in human stroke patients might also elicit NSC activation and modulate neuroinflammation.", "pages": "192-9"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Multi-session transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) elicits inflammatory and regenerative processes in the rat brain.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "22928032", "authors": ["Rueger, MA", "Keuters, MH", "Walberer, M", "Braun, R", "Klein, R", "Sparing, R", "Fink, GR", "Graf, R", "Schroeter, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Objectives: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated some efficacy in treatment-resistant major depression (TRD). The majority of previous controlled studies have used anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a control location such as the supraorbital region for the cathode. Several open-label studies have suggested effectiveness from anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC combined with cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC. Thus, this study evaluated the efficacy of tDCS using anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC compared to sham tDCS. Methods: Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited from a tertiary care university hospital. Twenty-four subjects with TRD and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression greater than 21 were randomized to receive tDCS or sham tDCS. The rates of remission were compared between the two treatment groups. Results: The remission rates did not differ significantly between the two groups using an intention to treat analysis. More subjects in the active tDCS group had failed a course of electroconvulsive therapy in the current depressive episode. Side effects did not differ between the two groups and in general the treatment was very well tolerated. Conclusion: Anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC was not efficacious in TRD. However, a number of methodological limitations warrant caution in generalizing from this study. Ongoing, controlled studies should provide further clarification on the efficacy of this stimulation configuration in TRD.

A distinction has been made between the generation of words clusters and switches between such clusters on verbal fluency tasks. Clusters, defined by the reporting of contiguous words that constitute semantic or phonemic subcategories, are thought to reflect relatively automatic processing. In contrast, switching from one subcategory to another is thought to require a more controlled, effortful form of cognitive processing. Objective: In this single-blind, sham-controlled experiment, we investigated whether anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can differentially modify controlled or automatic processes that support lexical retrieval, as assessed by clustering and switching on verbal fluency tasks, in 24 healthy right-handed adults. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1\u2009mA of either anodal (excitatory) or cathodal (inhibitory) active tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in addition to sham stimulation over the same region in counterbalanced order. Participants engaged in various cognitive activities during the first 23\u2009min of stimulation. Then, during the final segment of each 30-min session, they completed letter- and category-cued word fluency tasks. Results: Participants reported more words on category-cued word fluency tasks during anodal than sham stimulation (25.9 vs. 23.0 words; p\u2009=\u20090.055). They also showed a net increase in the number of clustered words during anodal stimulation compared to a net decrease during cathodal stimulation (1.3 vs. -1.5 words; p\u2009=\u20090.038).
