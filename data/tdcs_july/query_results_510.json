Reach adaptation in force fields has generalization patterns that suggest primary engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the intrinsic coordinates of joints and muscles, and lesser engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the extrinsic coordinates of the task. Among the cortical motor areas, the intrinsic coordinate system is most prominently represented in the primary sensorimotor cortices. Here, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to alter mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and found that when it was applied to the motor cortex, it increased generalization in intrinsic coordinates but not extrinsic coordinates. However, when tDCS was applied to the posterior parietal cortex, it had no effects on learning or generalization in the force field task. The results suggest that during force field adaptation, the component of learning that produces generalization in intrinsic coordinates depends on the plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex.", "pages": "7102-10"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation modulates activation-induced regional blood flow changes during voluntary movement.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "11048720", "authors": ["Paquette, C", "Sidel, M", "Radinska, BA", "Soucy, JP", "Thiel, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that induces changes in cortical excitability: anodal stimulation increases while cathodal stimulation reduces excitability. Imaging studies performed after unilateral stimulation have shown conflicting results regarding the effects of tDCS on surrogate markers of neuronal activity. The aim of this study was to directly measure these effects on activation-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow (\u0394rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during bilateral tDCS. Nine healthy subjects underwent repeated rCBF measurements with (15)O-water and PET during a simple motor task while receiving tDCS or sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also assessed before and after real and sham stimulation. During tDCS with active movement, \u0394rCBF in M1 was significantly lower on the cathodal than the anodal side when compared with sham stimulation. This decrease in \u0394rCBF was accompanied by a decrease in MEP amplitude on the cathodal side. No effect was observed on resting or activated rCBF relative to sham stimulation. We thus conclude that it is the interaction of cathodal tDCS with activation-induced \u0394rCBF rather than the effect on resting or activated rCBF itself which constitutes the physiological imaging correlate of tDCS.", "pages": "7102-10"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Predicting functional motor potential in chronic stroke patients using diffusion tensor imaging.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11180425", "authors": ["Lindenberg, R", "Zhu, LL", "R\u00fcber, T", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that the integrity of ipsilesional and inter-hemispheric motor circuits is important for motor recovery after stroke. However, the extent to which each of these tracts contributes to the variance in outcome remains unclear. We examined whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived measures of corticospinal and transcallosal tracts predict motor improvement in an experimental neurorehabilitation trial. 15 chronic stroke patients received bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation and simultaneous physical/occupational therapy for five consecutive days. Motor impairment was assessed prior to and after the intervention. At baseline, the patients underwent DTI; probabilistic fiber tracking was used to reconstruct the pyramidal tract (PT), alternate descending motor fibers (aMF), and transcallosal fibers connecting primary motor cortices (M1-M1). Ipsilesional corticospinal tracts (PT, aMF) and M1-M1 showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased directional diffusivities when compared to age-matched healthy controls. Partial correlations revealed that greater gains in motor function were related to higher FA values and lower directional diffusivities of transcallosal and ipsilesional corticospinal tracts. M1-M1 diffusivity had the greatest predictive value. An additional slice-by-slice analysis of FA values along the corticospinal tracts demonstrated that the more the ipsilesional FA profiles of patients resembled those of healthy controls, the greater their functional improvement. In conclusion, our study shows that DTI-derived measures can be used to predict functional potential for subsequent motor recovery in chronic stroke patients. Diffusivity parameters of individual tracts and tract combinations may help in assessing a patient's individual recovery potential and in determining optimal neurorehabilitative interventions.", "pages": "7102-10"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Clinical trial design in non-invasive brain stimulation psychiatric research.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11395017", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "International journal of methods in psychiatric research", "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) trials - investigating either non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions - have shown mixed results. Many reasons explain this heterogeneity, but one that stands out is the trial design due to specific challenges in the field. We aimed therefore to review the methodology of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) trials and provide a framework to improve clinical trial design. We performed a systematic review for randomized, controlled MDD trials whose intervention was transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in MEDLINE and other databases from April 2002 to April 2008. We created an unstructured checklist based on CONSORT guidelines to extract items such as power analysis, sham method, blinding assessment, allocation concealment, operational criteria used for MDD, definition of refractory depression and primary study hypotheses. Thirty-one studies were included. We found that the main methodological issues can be divided in to three groups: (1) issues related to phase II/small trials, (2) issues related to MDD trials and, (3) specific issues of NIBS studies. Taken together, they can threaten study validity and lead to inconclusive results. Feasible solutions include: estimating the sample size a priori; measuring the degree of refractoriness of the subjects; specifying the primary hypothesis and statistical tests; controlling predictor variables through stratification randomization methods or using strict eligibility criteria; adjusting the study design to the target population; using adaptive designs and exploring NIBS efficacy employing biological markers. In conclusion, our study summarizes the main methodological issues of NIBS trials and proposes a number of alternatives to manage them.", "pages": "7102-10"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Enhanced rapid-onset cortical plasticity in CADASIL as a possible mechanism of preserved cognition.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "12364533", "authors": ["List, J", "Duning, T", "Meinzer, M", "K\u00fcrten, J", "Schirmacher, A", "Deppe, M", "Evers, S", "Young, P", "Fl\u00f6el, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Ischemic small vessel disease (SVD) may lead to cognitive impairment, but cognitive deficits with a given burden of SVD vary significantly. The underlying mechanisms of impaired or preserved cognition are unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of ischemic SVD on rapid-onset cortical plasticity, as induced with a paired-associative stimulation protocol. To exclude concomitant effects of aging, we examined 12 middle-aged patients (48.3 \u00b1 8.3 years) with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) who suffered from severe ischemic SVD and a group of 12 age-matched controls (49.9 \u00b1 8.3 years). Cognitive status, motor performance and learning, and motor cortex excitability in response to cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) were assessed. White matter integrity was analyzed by conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We found that cognitive and motor functions were largely preserved in CADASIL patients, while rapid-onset cortical plasticity was significantly higher in the CADASIL group compared with controls (repeated measures analysis of variance [group \u00d7 time] interaction: P = 0.03). This finding was even more pronounced in patients with higher white matter lesion load. ctDCS revealed no evidence of cortical dysplasticity.

The HRV parameters (natural logarithms of LF, HF, and LF/HF) was assessed in 20 healthy men before, and immediately after tDCS and sham stimulation. After anodal tDCS in AG the parasympathetic activity (HF(log)) increased (P<0.01) and the sympathetic activity (LF(log)) and sympatho-vagal balance (LF/HF(log)) decreased (P<0.01), whereas no significant effects were detected in NAG (P>0.05). No significant changes in HRV indexes were provoked by sham stimulation in both AG and NAG (P>0.05). In conclusion, tDCS applied on the left temporal lobe significantly increased the overall HRV in AG, enhancing the parasympathetic and decreasing the sympathetic modulation of heart rate. Consequently the sympatho-vagal balance decreased at rest in AG but not in NAG.

VEPs have been widely employed in mice to study the visual system in physiological and pathological conditions and are extensively used as animal models of neurological and visual disorders. The present study was performed to evaluate whether mice VEPs could be modulated by tDCS in the same manner as in humans. We describe here the effects of 10 min tDCS (anodal, cathodal or no stimulation) on flash-VEPs in C57BL/6 mice under sevoflurane anesthesia. VEP amplitudes of the first major peak (P1) were analyzed before, at 0, 5 and 10 min after tDCS. Compared with no stimulation condition, anodal tDCS increased P1 amplitude slightly more than 25%, while cathodal stimulation had opposite effects, with a decrease of P1 amplitude by about 30%. After-effects tended to reverse toward basal levels within 10 min after tDCS. These results, suggesting polarity-dependent modulation similar to what described in humans of tDCS effects on VEPs, encourage the use of mice models to study tDCS mechanisms of action and explore therapeutic applications on neurological models of disease.", "pages": "7102-10"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improves selective muscle activation in the ipsilateral arm.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "19945398", "authors": ["McCambridge, AB", "Bradnam, LV", "Stinear, CM", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Proximal upper limb muscles are represented bilaterally in primary motor cortex. Goal-directed upper limb movement requires precise control of proximal and distal agonist and antagonist muscles. Failure to suppress antagonist muscles can lead to abnormal movement patterns, such as those commonly experienced in the proximal upper limb after stroke. We examined whether noninvasive brain stimulation of primary motor cortex could be used to improve selective control of the ipsilateral proximal upper limb. Thirteen healthy participants performed isometric left elbow flexion by contracting biceps brachii (BB; agonist) and left forearm pronation (BB antagonist) before and after 20 min of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) or sham tDCS of left M1. During the tasks, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in left BB were acquired using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of right M1 150-270 ms before muscle contraction. As expected, left BB MEPs were facilitated before flexion and suppressed before pronation. After c-tDCS, left BB MEP amplitudes were reduced compared with sham stimulation, before pronation but not flexion, indicating that c-tDCS enhanced selective muscle activation of the ipsilateral BB in a task-specific manner. The potential for c-tDCS to improve BB antagonist control correlated with BB MEP amplitude for pronation relative to flexion, expressed as a selectivity ratio. This is the first demonstration that selective muscle activation in the proximal upper limb can be improved after c-tDCS of ipsilateral M1 and that the benefits of c-tDCS for selective muscle activation may be most effective in cases where activation strategies are already suboptimal.
