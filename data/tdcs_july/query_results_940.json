Activation maps for a right hand sequential finger opposition task were obtained for six subjects before as well as 0-5 min and 15-20 min after a 5-min period of 1 mA cathodal and, in a separate session, anodal tDCS of the left-hemispheric motor cortex. Cathodal tDCS resulted in a global decrease of the mean number of activated pixels by 38% (P < 0.01) 0-5 min after stimulation, which reduced to 28% (P < 0.05) 15-20 min after stimulation. A region-of-interest analysis revealed a 57% decrease of activated pixels (P < 0.001) in the supplementary motor area, but no change in the hand area of the primary motor cortex. Anodal tDCS yielded a nonsignificant 5% increase of activated pixels with no regional differences. These findings support the view that reduced neuroaxonal excitability after cathodal tDCS causes reduced brain activity. However, rather than affecting the primary sensorimotor input of an active task, the process appears to dampen those responses that rely on cortico-cortical connections and related processing.

We studied the influence of tDCS, applied over the motorcortex during training, on angular deviation of post-training to pre-training TMS-evoked thumb movements.

Excitability changes of up to 40 %, revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, were accomplished and lasted for several minutes after the end of current stimulation. Excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. By varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after-effects could be controlled. The effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. Functional alterations related to post-tetanic potentiation, short-term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. Transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non-invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way.", "pages": "196-201"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation: applications in neuropsychiatry.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10686179", "authors": ["George, MS", "Lisanby, SH", "Sackeim, HA"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Archives of general psychiatry", "abstract": "In the 1990s, it is difficult to open a newspaper or watch television and not find someone claiming that magnets promote healing. Rarely do these claims stem from double-blind, peer-reviewed studies, making it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current fads resemble those at the end of the last century, when many were falsely touting the benefits of direct electrical and weak magnetic stimulation. Yet in the midst of this popular interest in magnetic therapy, a new neuroscience field has developed that uses powerful magnetic fields to alter brain activity--transcranial magnetic stimulation. This review examines the basic principles underlying transcranial magnetic stimulation, and describes how it differs from electrical stimulation or other uses of magnets. Initial studies in this field are critically summarized, particularly as they pertain to the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising new research and, perhaps, therapeutic tool, but more work remains before it can be fully integrated in psychiatry's diagnostic and therapeutic armamentarium.", "pages": "196-201"}, {"volume": "159", "title": "The first component of polyphasic motor evoked potentials is resistant to suppression by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "5966424", "authors": ["Kobayashi, M", "Hyodo, A", "Kurokawa, T", "Ueno, S"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "The suppressive effect of paired transcranial magnetic stimulation on the different components of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the left first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) was investigated in ten healthy human subjects.

The threshold stimulus intensity of the minimally contracted FDI was determined with each coil. The stimulus intensities of conditioning and test stimuli were 80% and 130-140% of the threshold intensity, respectively. The coil current direction at the intersection of the figure-eight coil was medio-lateral. The coil position for test stimuli was adjusted to evoke discretely polyphasic MEPs in the contracted FDI. Conditioning stimuli were followed by test stimuli at intervals of 1-10, and 15 ms. When the interstimulus intervals were less than 5 ms, the second negative phase of MEPs was suppressed compared to that of the unconditioned responses, whereas the first phase was not suppressed.

In seven normal subjects, subthreshold transcranial magnetic conditioning stimuli (using a figure-of-eight coil) were applied over the motor cortex in order to evoke activity in intracortical neuronal circuits. The net effect on cortical excitability was evaluated by measuring the effect on the size of EMG responses elicited in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle by a subsequent suprathreshold test stimulus. 2. A single conditioning stimulus suppressed the size of the test response at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-4 ms whereas the response was facilitated at ISIs of 6-20 ms. The facilitation could be augmented if pairs of conditioning stimuli were given. 3. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to have separate mechanisms. The threshold for inhibition (0.7 active motor threshold) was slightly lower than that for facilitation (0.8 active threshold). Similarly, the inhibitory effect was independent of the direction of current flow induced in the cortex by the conditioning shock, whereas facilitation was maximal with posterior-anterior currents and minimal with lateromedial current. 4. Direct corticospinal effects were probably not responsible for the results since facilitation of cortical test responses could be produced by conditioning stimuli which had no effect on the amplitude of H reflexes elicited in active ADM muscle. 5. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to interact in a roughly linear manner, consistent with separate inputs to a common neurone. 6.

However, SPECT and PET, the technologies most commonly used in these studies, are of limited value for assessment of the dynamics of cerebral blood flow changes at different states of functional brain activity. The introduction of transcranial Doppler sonography and the extended application of stimuli presentation and perception have now been added to the investigator's armamentarium. Simple sensory stimulation (visual, acoustic and tactile) and complex mental tasks (viewing of complex pictures, tactile differentiation of objects) changed the blood flow velocity in the basal intracranial arteries. These changes corresponded to the current concepts of functional cortical organization. The magnitude of the flow velocity increases upon visual stimulation was dependent on the complexity of the stimuli used, and was up to 38% in our studies. The introduction of continuous and bilateral simultaneous Doppler recordings, the calculation of mean flow velocity from cardiac cycle to cardiac cycle and a specially designed averaging method for data analysis allowed effective elimination of non-specific influences and made it possible to demonstrate rapid changes of perfusion in both middle cerebral artery territories in direct response to hemisphere-specific tasks. These changes were correlated with known functional cerebral asymmetries. A language task, for instance, was associated with a significantly larger flow velocity increase in the middle cerebral artery of the dominant hemisphere than in the corresponding artery of the non-dominant hemisphere (5.2 +/- 1,8% vs 3.0 +/- 1.8%, p < 0.001). The excellent time resolution of this technology made it possible to record hemodynamic changes taking place in response to modifications of neuronal activity within less than 1 s. The shortest time interval between stimulus presentation and the first significant increase in flow velocity was on average 717 +/- 191 ms. The latency of less than 1 s suggest that the coupling between alterations of neuronal activity and the regional cerebral blood flow response is mediated by an remarkably rapid mechanism.", "pages": "196-201"}, {"volume": "488 ( Pt 3)", "title": "Task-related variation in corticospinal output evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the macaque monkey.", "issue": "", "pmid": "300033", "authors": ["Baker, SN", "Olivier, E", "Lemon, RN"], "year": "1995", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1.
