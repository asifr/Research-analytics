Magnetic stimulation used a monophasic current pulse through a circular coil centred 3 cm anterior to the vertex. Lowest threshold magnetic stimulation occurred when the current in the coil flowed from the left to the right side at the posterior rim of the coil. Such stimulation produced single unit and surface EMG responses which had the same latency as those produced by anodal electric stimulation. If the direction of the magnetic stimulating current was reversed, response latencies became more variable from unit to unit, and on average they occurred 1.0 +/- 0.5 msec later. In single motor units anodal and magnetic post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) peaks had the same duration. This was similar to the duration of the PSTH peaks produced by a single low intensity stimulus given to the common peroneal nerve. We conclude that magnetic stimulation can produce direct activation of corticospinal neurones to the tibialis anterior if the direction of induced current flow is optimal. This projection is likely to be either monosynaptic or oligosynaptic.", "pages": "131-7"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "Determination of current density distributions generated by electrical stimulation of the human cerebral cortex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "7680994", "authors": ["Nathan, SS", "Sinha, SR", "Gordon, B", "Lesser, RP", "Thakor, NV"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "With the use of a 3-dimensional finite element model of the human brain based on structural data from MRI scans, we simulated patterns of current flow in the cerebral hemisphere with different types of electrical stimulation. Five different tissue types were incorporated into the model based on conductivities taken from the literature. The boundary value problem derived from Laplace's equation was solved with a quasi-static approximation. Transcranial electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes was poorly focussed and required high levels of current for stimulation of the cortex. Direct cortical stimulation with bipolar (adjacent) electrodes was found to be very effective in producing localized current flows. Unipolar cortical stimulation (with a more distant reference electrode) produced higher current densities at the same stimulating current as did bipolar stimulation, but stimulated a larger region of the cortex. With the simulated electrodes resting on the pia-arachnoid, as usually occurs clinically, there was significant shunting of the current (7/8 of the total current) through the CSF. Possible changes in electrodes and stimulation parameters that might improve stimulation procedures are considered.", "pages": "131-7"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve: intraoperative study on the effect of stimulus parameters on the excitation site in man.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "1501626", "authors": ["Schmid, UD", "M\u00f8ller, AR", "Schmid, J"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Magnetic stimulation (magStim) of the intracranial facial nerve is performed in clinical and research settings, but the activation site is a matter of controversy. Latencies of nasalis muscle responses to magStim were, therefore, compared with those obtained by direct electrical stimulation of the facial nerve (a) at the root exit zone (REZ); (b) at the porus of the facial canal; and (c) in the stylomastoid fossa during microvascular decompression operations in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Measurements of latencies of the nasalis muscle response, obtained while the stimulating coil was placed over the parieto-occipital area of the scalp, indicated that it was the labryinthine segment of the facial canal, 5 to 16 mm distal to the CPA, that was activated. This would be in agreement with studies of physical models reported in the literature that showed (a) the strength of the electrical current generated by a magnetic field is particularly high close to a nerve foramen; and (b) excitation to magStim is most likely to occur where the induced electrical field changes rapidly over distance, i.e., at anatomical boundaries between media of high and low specific resistance. These characteristics are found at the end of the labyrinthine segment of the facial canal, where the facial nerve leaves the low-resistance cerebrospinal fluid and enters the high-resistance petrous bone. The site of neural excitation is robust and unaffected by stimulus intensity and current direction within a wide range, or by large changes in location of the coil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "131-7"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Physiological studies of electric and magnetic stimulation of the human brain.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1773767", "authors": ["Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology. Supplement", "abstract": "It is suggested that transcranial electric stimulation can activate pyramidal tract projections both directly and indirectly in a manner similar to that described after direct stimulation of the exposed cortex in the monkey. This produces both D- and I-waves in the pyramidal tract. At high intensities of stimulation, the stimulus can spread into the brain and activate pyramidal tract axons several centimeters below the cortical surface. Magnetic stimulation at moderate intensities produces electromyographic (EMG) responses with latencies 1-2 msec longer than those after electric stimulation. Two possible explanations have been put forward to account for this effect: (1) because of the difference in the direction of electric current flow induced in the brain by the 2 forms of stimulation, magnetic stimulation preferentially excites pyramidal tract cells indirectly, and hence evokes only I-waves in the pyramidal tract. (2) Electric stimulation (even at threshold) activates pyramidal axons deep in the white matter, whereas magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal cells in the gray matter, probably at their initial segment. There is one interesting consequence common to both explanations. Whether magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically or at their initial segment, the size of the descending volley evoked will depend on the level of excitability of the motor cortex. In contrast, the response to electric stimulation will be less affected, since a proportion of the descending volley is initiated directly at the axon of the pyramidal cell. This differential effect of cortical excitability on the responses to electrical and magnetic stimulation can be useful in describing excitatory or inhibitory influences on motor cortex from other structures.", "pages": "131-7"}, {"volume": "91", "title": "[Transcranial electric stimulation therapy in the treatment of neurocirculatory asthenia].", "issue": "7", "pmid": "1661490", "authors": ["Akimov, GA", "Zabolotnykh, VA", "Lebedev, VP", "Zabolotnykh, II", "Chuprasova, TV", "Afoshin, SA", "Rozanov, SI", "Kassin, PL", "Preobrazhenskaia, SL"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Zhurnal nevropatologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Both electrical (with the anode overlying the face area of the motor cortex) and magnetic TCS (with the coil at the vertex) excite the upper motoneurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus, evoking motor potentials (C-MEPs) in the jaw-closing and suprahyoid muscles, but only during voluntary contraction. At least 30% of jaw-closing motoneurons are reached by direct fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are mainly crossed. Suprahyoid motoneurons are also reached by fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are probably bilateral. In the masseter, electrical TCS also evokes an ipsilateral motor response (R-MEP), followed by a later wave (U), and bilateral inhibitory periods. The R-MEP is secondary to excitation of the motor trigeminal root; the U wave probably results from the simultaneous excitation of Ia afferents in the root and ipsilaterally projecting corticofugal fibres; the inhibitory periods are largely due to activation of exteroceptive afferents in the root. Magnetic TCS, avoiding spread of current to the trigeminal root, evokes C-MEPs but not R-MEPs or U waves. The masseter inhibitory period after magnetic TCS may be due to excitation of corticofugal inhibitory fibres and to mechanical activation of Golgi tendon organs.", "pages": "131-7"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Evaluation of conduction in central motor pathways: techniques, pathophysiology, and clinical interpretation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "3543724", "authors": ["Cracco, RQ"], "year": "1987", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "This communication summarizes the highlights of this symposium and reviews our current understanding of the clinical neurophysiology of conduction in central motor pathways produced by transcranial or direct brain stimulation.

Existing evoked potentials monitor one or another sensory modality, but no generally usable motor monitor exists. We have reported a motor evoked potential using direct stimulation of the spinal cord over the motor tracts in cats and in humans. To achieve a less invasive monitor, we used transcranial stimulation over the motor cortex in the cat, thus stimulating the motor cortex. We report here the initial application of this method to humans. A plate electrode over the motor cortex on the scalp and a second electrode on the palate direct a mild current through the motor cortex which will activate the motor pathways. This signal can be recorded over the spinal cord. It can elicit contralateral peripheral nerve and electromyographic signals in the limbs or movements when the appropriate stimulation parameters are used. In clinical use to date, this has been more reliable than the somatosensory evoked potential in predicting motor function in patients where the two tests differed. It offers a number of possibilities for the development of valuable brain and spinal cord monitoring techniques, but requires further animal studies and clinical experience.
