It has useful characteristics, such as low cost, ease of use, reliable sham methodology, and relatively powerful effects on cortical excitability. Because of its potential to modulate cortical excitability noninvasively, tDCS has been tested for the treatment of depression for several decades. Therefore, we reviewed evidence on the use of tDCS for major depression examining evidence from past and recent tDCS studies. We also briefly compared tDCS with other techniques of neuromodulation, namely deep brain stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation; and suggest future directions for the use of tDCS in major depression.", "pages": "306-11"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation protocols in the treatment of epilepsy: current state and perspectives.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19332316", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "abstract": "Results from past clinical trials testing direct current stimulation as a therapeutic tool had mixed methodology and showed heterogeneous results.

Reducing neuronal excitability is a common target of antiepileptic therapies. Beyond or in addition to pharmacological interventions, excitability-reducing brain stimulation is pursued as an alternative therapeutic approach. Hereby, noninvasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have gained increased interest as efficient tools to modulate cortical excitability and activity. In animal models, stimulation-induced cortical excitability diminution has been shown to be suited to reduce seizures. Clinical studies conducted to date, however, have shown mixed results.
