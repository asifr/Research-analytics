Since the demonstration of SAI is primarily based on the attenuation of MEPs, its cortical origin is not yet fully understood. In the present study we combined TMS with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) in order to obtain direct cortical correlates of SAI. TMS-evoked EEG responses and MEPs were analysed with and without preceding electrical stimulation of the index finger cutaneous afferents in ten healthy volunteers. We show that the attenuation of MEPs by cutaneous stimulation has its counterpart in the attenuation of the N100 EEG response. Moreover, the attenuation of the cortical N100 component correlated positively with the strength of SAI, indicating that the transient changes in cortical excitability can be reflected in the amplitude dynamics of MEPs. We hypothesize that the hyperpolarization of the pyramidal cells due to SAI lowers the capacity of TMS to induce the inhibitory current needed to elicit N100, thus leading to its attenuation. We suggest that the observed interaction of two inhibitory processes, SAI and N100, provides further evidence for the cortical origin of SAI.", "pages": "517-26"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Cortical inhibition and habituation to evoked potentials: relevance for pathophysiology of migraine.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19209386", "authors": ["Brighina, F", "Palermo, A", "Fierro, B"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The journal of headache and pain", "abstract": "Dysfunction of neuronal cortical excitability has been supposed to play an important role in etiopathogenesis of migraine. Neurophysiological techniques like evoked potentials (EP) and in the last years non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation gave important contribution to understanding of such issue highlighting possible mechanisms of cortical dysfunctions in migraine. EP studies showed impaired habituation to repeated sensorial stimulation and this abnormality was confirmed across all sensorial modalities, making defective habituation a neurophysiological hallmark of the disease. TMS was employed to test more directly cortical excitability in visual cortex and then also in motor cortex. Contradictory results have been reported pointing towards hyperexcitability or on the contrary to reduced preactivation of sensory cortex in migraine. Other experimental evidence speaks in favour of impairment of inhibitory circuits and analogies have been proposed between migraine and conditions of sensory deafferentation in which down-regulation of GABA circuits is considered the more relevant pathophysiological mechanism. Whatever the mechanism involved, it has been found that repeated sessions of high-frequency rTMS trains that have been shown to up-regulate inhibitory circuits could persistently normalize habituation in migraine. This could give interesting insight into pathophysiology establishing a link between cortical inhibition and habituation and opening also new treatment strategies in migraine.", "pages": "517-26"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation: a new tool for the treatment of depression?", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9566403", "authors": ["Arul-Anandam, AP", "Loo, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that applies mild (typically 1-2 mA) direct currents via the scalp to enhance or diminish neuronal excitability. The technique has a dual function: on the one hand, it has been used to investigate the functions of various cortical regions; on the other, it has been used as an experimental treatment modality, most notably for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). With the growing utility of tDCS in psychiatry, it is important from the vantage of safety and effectiveness to understand its underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In this respect, researchers have made significant progress in recent years, highlighting changes in resting membrane potential, spontaneous neuronal firing rates, synaptic strength, cerebral blood flow and metabolism subsequent to tDCS.

Depending on the polarity of the stimulation, tDCS can increase (anodal tDCS) or decrease (cathodal tDCS) cortical excitability in the stimulated brain regions and thereby enable the investigation of the causal relationships between brain activity and behavior. Recently, tDCS has been increasingly used to investigate human cognitive and motor functions in both healthy volunteers and neurological patients. Although tDCS generally produces diffuse cortical stimulation over a period of time, it has several advantages over other brain-stimulation tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). First, since tDCS produces less artifacts such as acoustic noise and muscle twitching, it is more suitable for double-blind, sham-controlled studies and clinical applications. Second, tDCS is not very expensive and can be performed with compact equipment, it can be easily combined with ongoing projects in neuroscience and psychology laboratories. Third, the facilitation of motor and cognitive functions by anodal tDCS may have great potential for cognitive and motor enhancement, for example, to support learning in healthy volunteers and to expedite the rehabilitation process in neurological patients. Finally, thus far, seizure incidents have not been reported in tDCS studies, tDCS has thus become a complementary tool to TMS and occupies a unique position in current cognitive neuroscience.", "pages": "517-26"}, {"volume": "106", "title": "Noninvasive cortical stimulation enhances motor skill acquisition over multiple days through an effect on consolidation.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "2215917", "authors": ["Reis, J", "Schambra, HM", "Cohen, LG", "Buch, ER", "Fritsch, B", "Zarahn, E", "Celnik, PA", "Krakauer, JW"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "abstract": "Motor skills can take weeks to months to acquire and can diminish over time in the absence of continued practice. Thus, strategies that enhance skill acquisition or retention are of great scientific and practical interest. Here we investigated the effect of noninvasive cortical stimulation on the extended time course of learning a novel and challenging motor skill task. A skill measure was chosen to reflect shifts in the task's speed-accuracy tradeoff function (SAF), which prevented us from falsely interpreting variations in position along an unchanged SAF as a change in skill. Subjects practiced over 5 consecutive days while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1). Using the skill measure, we assessed the impact of anodal (relative to sham) tDCS on both within-day (online) and between-day (offline) effects and on the rate of forgetting during a 3-month follow-up (long-term retention). There was greater total (online plus offline) skill acquisition with anodal tDCS compared to sham, which was mediated through a selective enhancement of offline effects. Anodal tDCS did not change the rate of forgetting relative to sham across the 3-month follow-up period, and consequently the skill measure remained greater with anodal tDCS at 3 months. This prolonged enhancement may hold promise for the rehabilitation of brain injury. Furthermore, these findings support the existence of a consolidation mechanism, susceptible to anodal tDCS, which contributes to offline effects but not to online effects or long-term retention.", "pages": "517-26"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation and pain.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "2000496", "authors": ["Rosen, AC", "Ramkumar, M", "Nguyen, T", "Hoeft, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current pain and headache reports", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are two noninvasive brain stimulation techniques that can modulate activity in specific regions of the cortex.

Previous studies with techniques of noninvasive brain stimulation--transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)--have shown that these methods are associated with a significant alleviation of fibromyalgia-associated pain and sleep dysfunction. Here we sought to determine whether a longer treatment protocol involving 10 sessions of 2 mA, 20 min tDCS of the left primary motor (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could offer additional, more long-lasting clinical benefits in the management of pain from fibromyalgia. METHODS: Forty-one women with chronic, medically refractory fibromyalgia were randomized to receive 10 daily sessions of M1, DLPFC, or sham tDCS. RESULTS: Our results show that M1 and DLPFC stimulation both display improvements in pain scores (VAS) and quality of life (FIQ) at the end of the treatment protocol, but only M1 stimulation resulted in long-lasting clinical benefits as assessed at 30 and 60 days after the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of the duration of the treatment period, suggesting that 10 daily sessions of tDCS result in more long lasting outcomes than only five sessions. Furthermore, this study supports the findings of a similarly designed rTMS trial as both induce pain reductions that are equally long-lasting.", "pages": "517-26"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation - what is the evidence for its efficacy and safety?", "issue": "", "pmid": "18598264", "authors": ["Arul-Anandam, AP", "Loo, C", "Sachdev, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "F1000 medicine reports", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has emerged in the past decade as a useful investigative and therapeutic technique.
