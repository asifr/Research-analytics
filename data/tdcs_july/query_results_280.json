In patients suffering from depression, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is hypoactive, while activity of the right DLPFC is enhanced. Counterbalancing these pathological excitability alterations by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves mood in these patients. In healthy subjects, however, rTMS of the same areas has no major effect, and the effects of tDCS are mixed. We aimed to evaluate the effects of prefrontal tDCS on emotion and emotion-related cognitive processing in healthy humans. In a first study, we administered excitability-enhancing anodal, excitability-diminishing cathodal, and placebo tDCS to the left DLPFC, combined with antagonistic stimulation of the right frontopolar cortex, and tested acute emotional changes by an adjective checklist. Subjective emotions were not influenced by tDCS. Emotional face identification, however, which was explored in a second experiment, was subtly improved by a tDCS-driven excitability modulation of the prefrontal cortex, markedly by anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC for positive emotional content. We conclude that tDCS of the prefrontal cortex improves emotion processing in healthy subjects, but does not influence subjective emotional state.", "pages": "58"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Behavioral and electrophysiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation of the parietal cortex in a visuo-spatial working memory task.", "issue": "", "pmid": "3879361", "authors": ["Heimrath, K", "Sandmann, P", "Becke, A", "M\u00fcller, NG", "Zaehle, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry / Frontiers Research Foundation", "abstract": "Impairments of working memory (WM) performance are frequent concomitant symptoms in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases. Despite the great advance in treating the reduced WM abilities in patients suffering from, e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the exact neurophysiological underpinning subserving these therapeutic tDCS-effects are still unknown. In the present study we investigated the impact of tDCS on performance in a visuo-spatial WM task and its underlying neural activity. In three experimental sessions, participants performed a delayed matching-to-sample WM task after sham, anodal, and cathodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex. The results showed that tDCS modulated WM performance and its underlying electrophysiological brain activity in a polarity-specific way. Parietal tDCS altered event-related potentials and oscillatory power in the alpha band at posterior electrode sites. The present study demonstrates that posterior tDCS can alter visuo-spatial WM performance by modulating the underlying neural activity. This result can be considered an important step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in tDCS-induced modulations of cognitive processing. This is of particular importance for the application of electrical brain stimulation as a therapeutic treatment of neuropsychiatric deficits in clinical populations.", "pages": "58"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to Treat Depression in HIV-Infected Persons: The Outcomes of a Feasibility Study.", "issue": "", "pmid": "3596923", "authors": ["Knotkova, H", "Rosedale, M", "Strauss, SM", "Horne, J", "Soto, E", "Cruciani, RA", "Malaspina, D", "Malamud, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry / Frontiers Research Foundation", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel non-invasive neuromodulatory method that influences neuronal firing rates and excitability of neuronal circuits in the brain. tDCS has been shown to relieve Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the general population, suggesting its potential for other vulnerable populations with high MDD prevalence. Aims: This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of a 2-week tDCS antidepressant treatment in HIV-MDD co-diagnosed patients, and the feasibility of collecting serum and saliva for analysis of immunity biomarkers. Methods: Ten enrolled patients underwent baseline evaluation and started the tDCS treatment (Monday-Friday for 2\u2009weeks) delivered with Phoresor II 850 PM for 20\u2009min at 2\u2009mA at each visit, using two saline-soaked sponge electrodes placed over the F3 position of EEG 10-20 system and the contralateral supraorbital region. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, after the last tDCS and 2\u2009weeks later. A quantitative microarray (Ray Bio Tech Inc.) for TH1/TH2 cytokines was used for saliva and plasma analysis. Results: Analyzable outcome-data were obtained from eight subjects. Depression scores significantly decreased (p\u2009<\u20090.0005) after the treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. Several transient minor AEs and occasional changes of blood pressure and heart rate were noted. Mini-mental state examination scores remained unchanged or increased after the treatment. All subjects were highly satisfied with the protocol and treatment results and described the desire to find new treatments for HIV-MDD as motivating participation. Conclusion: Findings support feasibility and clinical potential of tDCS for HIV-MDD patients, and justify larger-sample, sham-controlled trials.", "pages": "58"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Clinical applications of noninvasive electrical stimulation: problems and potential.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ENCS)", "abstract": "Both transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can produce lasting aftereffects on cortical function that are thought to be due to the initial stages of synaptic potentiation/depression. They can also interact with processes of normal learning, to increase or decrease the rate of learning and retention. These features have spurred a number of investigators to test whether there is any clinical therapeutic potential for the methods to improve recovery of function after damage to the brain by injury or disease. The only condition where there is sufficient evidence is in certain forms of depression where excitatory rTMS is a recommended treatment protocol; there is insufficient evidence for any other condition. The problem facing investigators is the variety of possible paradigms that can be applied. Particularly for tDCS, only a small range of possible parameters has been tested, even in healthy volunteers; in addition, it is unclear whether stimulation should be applied at the same time as a behavioral therapy or whether stimulation should be applied at rest. Present trials give some evidence that can be used to address these questions, but until they are answered more securely it will be difficult to reach a consensus about \"standard\" protocols that can then be tested widely in multicenter trials.", "pages": "58"}, {"volume": "119", "title": "The effects of prolonged cathodal direct current stimulation on the excitatory and inhibitory circuits of the ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortex.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "11723286", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Manganelli, F", "Dileone, M", "Notturno, F", "Esposito, M", "Capasso, M", "Dubbioso, R", "Pace, M", "Ranieri, F", "Minicuci, G", "Santoro, L", "Uncini, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Weak cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human hand area modulates corticospinal excitability with a suppression of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

The aim of present study was to evaluate whether a long-lasting suppression of cortical excitability could be induced by prolonged cathodal tDCS (20 min of stimulation). We also explored the impact of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms, on tDCS after-effects. Cortical excitability to single and paired-pulse TMS was evaluated both for the stimulated and contralateral hemisphere, before and up to 24 h after 20 min of cathodal tDCS. We evaluated threshold and amplitude of MEPs, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). tDCS produced a pronounced suppression of MEP amplitude that was still significant at 3 h after the end of stimulation. The BDNF genotype had not influence on tDCS after-effects. Thresholds for MEPs, SICI and ICF were not affected. No significant effect was observed in the contralateral hemisphere.

However the attentional mechanisms subtending visual selection of different levels of information are poorly understood. The classical left hemisphere/local-right hemisphere/global dichotomy has been recently challenged by studies linking the asymmetry of activation in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) with the relative salience of the stimulus rather than with the local/global level. The present study aimed to assess hemispheric asymmetry in local-global and salience-based selection in hierarchical stimuli by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To this end, tDCS has been applied to the PPC of both the hemispheres. Our data revealed that tDCS did affect the selection of the target on the basis of its relative salience in a manner that depended on the tDCS polarity applied to the two hemispheres. This result is in line with previous findings that the left PPC is critically involved in attention for low-salience stimuli in the presence of high-salience distractor information, while right PPC is involved in attending to more salient stimuli. Hemispheric asymmetries were also found in local/global selection. Overall the results suggest that neural activation in the PPC is related to both the salience and the level of stimulus representations mediating responses to hierarchical stimuli. The comparison of the results from Experiments 1 and 2 in local/global-based selection suggests that the effect of stimulation could be completely opposite depending on subtle differences in demands of attentional control (sustained attention vs task switching).", "pages": "58"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Direct current stimulation (tDCS) reveals parietal asymmetry in local/global and salience-based selection.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "12544830", "authors": ["Bardi, L", "Kanai, R", "Mapelli, D", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess whether the simultaneous application of slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the neuroplastic response to transcranial magnetic theta burst stimulation.
