Previous studies suggest that the rIPS is especially involved in top-down control and spatial distribution of attention across both visual hemifields. We further explored these attentional functions using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the rIPS to modulate behavioral performance in a partial report task. Performance was analyzed according to the theory of visual attention (TVA) (Bundesen, 1990), which provides a computational framework to investigate different parameters of visuo-attentional processing such as top-down control, attentional weighting, capacity of visual short term memory, and processing speed. We investigated the effects of different tDCS current strengths (1 mA and 2 mA) in two experiments: 1 mA tDCS (anodal, cathodal, sham) did not affect any of the TVA parameters, but cathodal 2 mA stimulation significantly enhanced top-down control as evidenced by a reduction of the \u03b1 parameter of TVA, regardless of hemifield. This differential impact on the top-down control component of attentional processing suggests that the horizontal rIPS is mainly involved in attentional selection as none of the spatial or resource variables of TVA were altered. Furthermore, the data add evidence to previous work highlighting (1) the importance of using appropriate current strength in stimulation protocols, and (2) that the often reported inhibitory effect of cathodal stimulation in e.g., motor tasks might not extend to cognitive paradigms.", "pages": "53-65"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Differential involvement of the left frontal and temporal regions in verb naming: a tDCS treatment study.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "20602051", "authors": ["Marangolo, P", "Fiori, V", "Di Paola, M", "Cipollari, S", "Razzano, C", "Oliveri, M", "Caltagirone, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Although deep brain (DBS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are used as investigative tools and therapies for a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood.
