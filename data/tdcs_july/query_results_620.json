Attempts to develop evidence-based therapies have been thwarted by a poor understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. However, recent work points toward a pivotal role of maladaptive cortical reorganization in the generation and perpetuation of tinnitus. Changes in the representation of sounds, abnormalities of oscillatory activity, and hyperactivity in higher order areas of auditory processing have been linked with the perception of tinnitus. Brain stimulation techniques have entered the field and have opened exciting new perspectives for the modulation of dysfunctional brain activity. In this review, a comprehensive overview on the use of brain-stimulation techniques in the exploration and experimental treatment of tinnitus is provided.", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Modulating functional connectivity patterns and topological functional organization of the human brain with transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "20607750", "authors": ["Polan\u00eda, R", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "abstract": "Noninvasive and invasive brain stimulation techniques, for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), direct current stimulation (tDCS), and direct electrical cortical stimulation gave rise to a new line of investigation in tinnitus research.

Second, the reduction of tinnitus-associated enhancement of cortical activity by neuronavigated TMS has been demonstrated to ameliorate tinnitus. Third, preliminary data suggest that repeated application of TMS or continuous cortical stimulation may lead to a longer lasting suppression of tinnitus.", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Neuromodulation approaches for the treatment of major depression: challenges and recommendations from a working group meeting.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20602051", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Teng, CT", "Correa, C", "Imamura, M", "Brasil-Neto, JP", "Boechat, R", "Rosa, M", "Caramelli, P", "Cohen, R", "Del Porto, JA", "Boggio, PS", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria", "abstract": "These proof of principle studies point toward a new option for the investigation and neurophysiology based treatment of tinnitus.

Stimulation for few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be caused by stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function through functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis. Single recordings in healthy volunteers with 62 electroencephalography channels were acquired before and after 10 min of facilitatory anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1), combined with inhibitory cathodal tDCS of the contralateral frontopolar cortex, in resting state and during voluntary hand movements. Correlation matrices containing all 62 pairwise electrode combinations were calculated with the synchronization likelihood (SL) method and thresholded to construct undirected graphs for the \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, low-\u03b3 and high-\u03b3 frequency bands. SL matrices and undirected graphs were compared before and after tDCS. Functional connectivity patterns significantly increased within premotor, motor, and sensorimotor areas of the stimulated hemisphere during motor activity in the 60-90 Hz frequency range. Additionally, tDCS-induced significant intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity changes in all the studied frequency bands. In summary, we show for the first time evidence for tDCS-induced changes in brain synchronization and topological functional organization.", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Neuromodulation of decision-making in the addictive brain.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "20590399", "authors": ["Fecteau, S", "Fregni, F", "Boggio, PS", "Camprodon, JA", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Substance use & misuse", "abstract": "The use of neuromodulation as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) has recently attracted renewed interest due to development of other non-pharmacological therapies besides electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Direct current brain polarization: a simple, noninvasive technique for human neuromodulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16972076", "authors": ["Ukueberuwa, D", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society", "abstract": "We convened a working group of researchers to discuss the updates and key challenges of neuromodulation use for the treatment of MDD.", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Brain stimulation for the treatment of pain: A review of costs, clinical effects, and mechanisms of treatment for three different central neuromodulatory approaches.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16857324", "authors": ["Zaghi, S", "Heine, N", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of pain management", "abstract": "The state-of-art of neuromodulation techniques was reviewed and discussed in four sections: [1] epidemiology and pathophysiology of MDD; [2] a comprehensive overview of the neuromodulation techniques; [3] using neuromodulation techniques in MDD associated with non-psychiatric conditions; [4] the main challenges of neuromodulation research and alternatives to overcome them.", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Enhancing multisensory spatial orienting by brain polarization of the parietal cortex.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "17296913", "authors": ["Bolognini, N", "Olgiati, E", "Rossetti, A", "Maravita, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "ECT is the first-line treatment for severe depression.

Here we address the validity of this appealing approach by investigating the effect of coupling a multisensory visual field exploration training with tDCS of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The multisensory visual field exploration training consisted in the practice of visual search through the systematic audio-visual stimulation of the visual field. Neurologically unimpaired participants performed a bimodal exploration training for 30 min, while simultaneously receiving anodal-excitatory PPC tDCS or sham tDCS. In two different experiments, the left and the right hemisphere were stimulated. Outcome measures included visual exploration speed at different time intervals during the training, and the post-training effects on tests assessing visual scanning and visuo-spatial orienting. Results show that PPC tDCS applied to the right, but not to the left, hemisphere increases the training-induced behavioural improvement of visual exploration, as compared to sham tDCS. In addition, right PPC tDCS brings about an improvement of covert visual orienting, in a task different from the visual search practice. In an additional experiment, we confirm that right parietal tDCS by itself, even without the associated training, can lead to enhancement of visual search. Overall, anodal PPC tDCS is a promising technique to enhance visuo-spatial abilities, when combined to a visual field exploration training task.", "pages": "449-61"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor cortex induces distinct changes in thermal and mechanical sensory percepts.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "17452283", "authors": ["Bachmann, CG", "Muschinsky, S", "Nitsche, MA", "Rolke, R", "Magerl, W", "Treede, RD", "Paulus, W", "Happe, S"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation can modify decision-making behaviors in healthy subjects.
