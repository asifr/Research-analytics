These include the mood and anxiety disorders, and the schizophrenias. As a natural next step, clinical researchers have investigated whether the minimally invasive brain stimulation technologies (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS] or transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]) might potentially treat these disorders. In this review, we critically review the research studies that have examined TMS or tDCS as putative treatments for depression, mania, obsessive-complusive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or schizophrenia. (Separate controversy articles deal with using TMS or tDCS to treat pain or tinnitus. We will not review here the large number of studies using TMS or tDCS as research probes to understand disease mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.) Although there is an extensive body of randomized controlled trials showing antidepressant effects of daily prefrontal repetitive TMS, the magnitude or durability of this effect remains controversial. US Food and Drug Administration approval of TMS for depression was recently granted. There is much less data in all other diseases, and therapeutic effects in other psychiatric conditions, if any, are still controversial. Several issues and problems extend across all psychiatric TMS studies, including the optimal method for a sham control, appropriate coil location, best device parameters (intensity, frequency, dosage, and dosing schedule) and refining what subjects should be doing during treatment (activating pathologic circuits or not). In general, TMS or tDCS as a treatment for most psychiatric disorders remains exciting but controversial, other than prefrontal TMS for depression.", "pages": "14-21"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Increasing human brain excitability by transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation.", "issue": "52", "pmid": "19109497", "authors": ["Terney, D", "Chaieb, L", "Moliadze, V", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "For >20 years, noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been used to induce neuroplastic-like effects in the human cortex, leading to the activity-dependent modification of synaptic transmission. Here, we introduce a novel method of electrical stimulation: transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), whereby a random electrical oscillation spectrum is applied over the motor cortex. tRNS induces consistent excitability increases lasting 60 min after stimulation. These effects have been observed in 80 subjects through both physiological measures and behavioral tasks. Higher frequencies (100-640 Hz) appear to be responsible for generating this excitability increase, an effect that may be attributed to the repeated opening of Na(+) channels. In terms of efficacy tRNS appears to possess at least the same therapeutic potential as rTMS/tDCS in diseases such as depression, while furthermore avoiding the constraint of current flow direction sensitivity characteristic of tDCS.", "pages": "14-21"}, {"volume": "199", "title": "Exploring a novel therapeutic approach with noninvasive cortical stimulation for vulvodynia.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "19084092", "authors": ["Cecilio, SB", "Zaghi, S", "Cecilio, LB", "Correa, CF", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2008", "journal": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "abstract": "Existing therapies for vulvodynia are inadequate.

In the present study, we demonstrate that a new technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can interact with ongoing rhythmic activities in the visual cortex in a frequency-specific fashion and induce visual experiences (phosphenes). We delivered an oscillatory current over the occipital cortex with tACS. In order to observe interactions with ongoing cortical rhythms, we compared the effects of delivering tACS under conditions of light (\"Light\" condition) or darkness (\"Dark\" condition). Stimulation over the occipital cortex induced perception of continuously flickering light most effectively when the beta frequency range was applied in an illuminated room, whereas the most effective stimulation frequency shifted to the alpha frequency range during testing in darkness. Stimulation with theta or gamma frequencies did not produce any visual phenomena. The shift of the effective stimulation frequency indicates that the frequency dependency is caused by interactions with ongoing oscillatory activity in the stimulated cortex. Our results suggest that tACS can be used as a noninvasive tool for establishing a causal link between rhythmic cortical activities and their functions.", "pages": "14-21"}]
