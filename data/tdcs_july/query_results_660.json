Currently, the duration of the aftereffects of stimulation is restricted. For future clinical applications, stimulation protocols are required that produce aftereffects lasting for days or weeks. Options to prolong the effects of tDCS are further prolongation or repetition of tDCS. Nothing is known thus far about optimal protocols in this behalf, although repetitive stimulation is already performed in clinical applications. Thus we explored the effects of different break durations on cathodal tDCS-induced cortical excitability alterations. In 12 subjects, two identical periods of cathodal tDCS (9-min duration; 1 mA) with an interstimulation interval of 0 (no break), 3, or 20 min or 3 or 24 h were performed. The results indicate that doubling stimulation duration without a break prolongs the aftereffects from 60 to 90 min after tDCS. When the second stimulation was performed during the aftereffects of the first, a prolongation and enhancement of tDCS-induced effects for \u2264 120 min after stimulation was observed. In contrast, when the second stimulation followed the first one after 3 or 24 h, the aftereffects were initially attenuated, or abolished, but afterwards re-established for up to 120 min after tDCS in the 24-h condition. These results suggest that, for prolonging the aftereffects of cathodal tDCS, stimulation interval might be important.", "pages": "1735-40"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Modulation of decision-making in a gambling task in older adults with transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20105234", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Campanh\u00e3, C", "Valasek, CA", "Fecteau, S", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Cognitive performance usually declines in older adults as a result of neurodegenerative processes. One of the cognitive domains usually affected is decision-making. Based on our recent findings suggesting that non-invasive brain stimulation can improve decision-making in young participants, we studied whether bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right and left prefrontal cortex of older adult subjects can change balance of risky and safe responses as it can in younger individuals. Twenty-eight subjects (age range from 50 to 85 years) performed a gambling risk task while receiving either anodal tDCS over the right and cathodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anodal tDCS over the left with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC, or sham stimulation. Our main finding was a significant group effect showing that participants receiving left anodal/right cathodal stimulation chose more often high-risk prospects as compared with participants receiving sham or those receiving right anodal/left cathodal stimulation. This result is contrary to previous findings in young subjects, suggesting that modulation of cortical activity in young and elderly results in opposite behavioral effects; thus supporting fundamental changes in cognitive processing in the elderly.", "pages": "1735-40"}, {"volume": "74", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in the treatment of anorexia.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "20096507", "authors": ["Hecht, D"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique for brain stimulation and it increasingly being used in the treatments of some neurological/psychiatric conditions (e.g. chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, motor rehabilitation after stroke and Parkinson's disease). With tDCS, cortical neurons excitability increases in the vicinity of the anodal electrode and suppressed near the cathodal electrode. There is evidence that anorexia is associated with hyperactivity in right-hemisphere frontal regions. tDCS, therefore has a promising potential in facilitating inter-hemispheric balance. A tDCS protocol is proposed: the anode electrode placed over the left prefrontal cortex and the cathode electrode located, either on the right homotopic region for non-SSRI-medicated anorexics, or on a non-cephalic site for SSRI-medicated anorexics. Together with nutritional supplements, psychotherapy and other treatments, tDCS have a good potential, as a complementary tool, in the treatment of anorexia.", "pages": "1735-40"}, {"volume": "166", "title": "Slow-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation can induce bidirectional shifts in motor cortical excitability in awake humans.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "20083166", "authors": ["Groppa, S", "Bergmann, TO", "Siems, C", "M\u00f6lle, M", "Marshall, L", "Siebner, HR"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Constant transcranial direct stimulation (c-tDCS) of the primary motor hand area (M1(HAND)) can induce bidirectional shifts in motor cortical excitability depending on the polarity of tDCS. Recently, anodal slow oscillation stimulation at a frequency of 0.75 Hz has been shown to augment intrinsic slow oscillations during sleep and theta oscillations during wakefulness. To embed this new type of stimulation into the existing tDCS literature, we aimed to characterize the after effects of slowly oscillating stimulation (so-tDCS) on M1(HAND) excitability and to compare them to those of c-tDCS. Here we show that so-tDCS at 0.8 Hz can also induce lasting changes in corticospinal excitability during wakefulness. Experiment 1. In 10 healthy awake individuals, we applied c-tDCS or so-tDCS to left M1(HAND) on separate days. Each tDCS protocol lasted for 10 min. Measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) confirmed previous work showing that anodal c-tDCS at an intensity of 0.75 mA (maximal current density 0.0625 mA/cm2) enhanced corticospinal excitability, while cathodal c-tDCS at 0.75 mA reduced it. The polarity-specific shifts in excitability persisted for at least 20 min after c-tDCS. Using a peak current intensity of 0.75 mA, neither anodal nor cathodal so-tDCS had consistent effects on corticospinal excitability. Experiment 2. In a separate group of ten individuals, peak current intensity of so-tDCS was raised to 1.5 mA (maximal current density 0.125 mA/cm2) to match the total amount of current applied with so-tDCS to the amount of current that had been applied with c-tDCS at 0.75 mA in Experiment 1. At peak intensity of 1.5 mA, anodal and cathodal so-tDCS produced bidirectional changes in corticospinal excitability comparable to the after effects that had been observed after c-tDCS at 0.75 mA in Experiment 1. The results show that so-tDCS can induce bidirectional shifts in corticospinal excitability in a similar fashion as c-tDCS if the total amount of applied current during the tDCS session is matched.", "pages": "1735-40"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Failure of cathodal direct current stimulation to improve fine motor control in musician's dystonia.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20063390", "authors": ["Buttkus, F", "Weidenm\u00fcller, M", "Schneider, S", "Jabusch, HC", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Altenm\u00fcller, E"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Musician's dystonia (MD) is a task-specific movement disorder with a loss of voluntary motor control in highly trained movements.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether ctDCS improves fine motor control in MD. Professional guitarists (n = 10) with MD played exercises before, directly after ctDCS, and 60 min after ctDCS. ctDCS (2 mA, 20 min) was applied on the primary motor cortex contralateral to the affected hand.

In vitro electrophysiologic data from mouse models of FXS suggest that loss of fragile X mental retardation protein affects intracortical excitability and synaptic plasticity. Specifically, the cortex appears hyperexcitable, and use-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength are abnormal. Though animal models provide important information, FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders are human diseases and as such translational research to evaluate cortical excitability and plasticity must be applied in the human. Transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms have recently been developed to non-invasively investigate cortical excitability using paired pulse stimulation, as well as LTP- and LTD-like synaptic plasticity in response to theta burst stimulation (TBS) in vivo in the human. TBS applied on consecutive days can be used to measure metaplasticity (the ability of the synapse to undergo a second plastic change following a recent induction of plasticity). The current study investigated intracortical inhibition, plasticity and metaplasticity in full mutation females with FXS, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and neurotypical controls. Results suggest that intracortical inhibition is normal in participants with FXS, while plasticity and metaplasticity appear abnormal. ASD participants showed abnormalities in plasticity and metaplasticity, as well as heterogeneity in intracortical inhibition. Our findings highlight the utility of non-invasive neurophysiological measures to translate insights from animal models to humans with neurodevelopmental disorders, and thus provide direct confirmation of cortical dysfunction in patients with FXS and ASD.", "pages": "1735-40"}]
