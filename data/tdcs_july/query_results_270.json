PPS representation has a direct effect on the motor system: a stimulus activating the PPS around the hand modulates the excitability of hand representation in the primary motor cortex. However, to date, direct information about the involvement of the PMc-PPc network in the motor mapping of sensory events occurring within PPS is lacking. To address this issue, we used a 'perturb-and-measure' paradigm based on the combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques. Cathodal tDCS was applied to transiently suppress neural activity in PMc, PPc and primary visual cortex (V1; serving as an active control site); single-pulse TMS was used to induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from hand muscles and so to measure the excitability of the hand motor representation. MEPs were compared when a sound was presented either near the hand or at a distance. In experimental sessions performed after sham-tDCS and after tDCS over the control area V1, we found a spatially dependent modulation of the hand motor representation: sounds presented near the hand induced an inhibitory motor response as compared to sounds presented far apart. Critically, this effect was selectively abolished after tDCS suppression of neural activity in PMc, but not when perturbing the activity of PPc. These findings suggest that PMc has a critical role in mapping sensory representations of space onto the motor system.", "pages": "306-15"}, {"volume": "221", "title": "After-effects of consecutive sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a rat model of chronic inflammation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "22752510", "authors": ["Laste, G", "Caumo, W", "Adachi, LN", "Rozisky, JR", "de Macedo, IC", "Filho, PR", "Partata, WA", "Fregni, F", "Torres, IL"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Thus, experimental animal research that allows the use of more invasive interventions and creates additional control of independent variables and confounders is desirable.

Primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be engaged during implicit motor learning, while dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is critical for explicit learning. To elucidate the neural substrates underlying the interaction between implicit and explicit memory systems, adults underwent a randomized crossover experiment of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) applied over M1, PMd or sham stimulation during implicit motor sequence (serial reaction time task, SRTT) practice. We hypothesized that M1-AtDCS during practice will enhance online performance and offline learning of the implicit motor sequence. In contrast, we also hypothesized that PMd-AtDCS will attenuate performance and retention of the implicit motor sequence. Implicit sequence performance was assessed at baseline, at the end of acquisition (EoA), and 24 h after practice (retention test, RET). M1-AtDCS during practice significantly improved practice performance and supported offline stabilization compared with Sham tDCS. Performance change from EoA to RET revealed that PMd-AtDCS during practice attenuated offline stabilization compared with M1-AtDCS and sham stimulation. The results support the role of M1 in implementing online performance gains and offline stabilization for implicit motor sequence learning. In contrast, enhancing the activity within explicit motor memory network nodes such as the PMd during practice may be detrimental to offline stabilization of the learned implicit motor sequence. These results support the notion of competition between implicit and explicit motor memory systems and identify underlying neural substrates that are engaged in this competition.", "pages": "306-15"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "[Non-invasive brain stimulation for relieving acute and chronic pain].", "issue": "5-6", "pmid": "22724283", "authors": ["Csifcs\u00e1k, G", "Antal, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Ideggy\u00f3gy\u00e1szati szemle", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces cortical excitability changes in animals and humans that can last beyond the duration of stimulation. Preliminary evidence suggests that tDCS may have an analgesic effect; however, the timing of these effects, especially when associated with consecutive sessions of stimulation in a controlled animal experiment setting, has yet to be fully explored. To evaluate the effects of tDCS in inflammatory chronic pain origin immediately and 24 h after the last treatment session, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected (100 \u03bcl) in the right footpad to induce inflammation. On the 15th day after CFA injection, rats were divided into two groups: tDCS (n = 9) and sham (n = 9). The tDCS was applied for 8 days. The hot plate and Von Frey tests were applied immediately and 24 h after the last tDCS session. Eight 20-min sessions of 500 \u03bcA anodal tDCS resulted in antinociceptive effects as assessed by the hot plate test immediately (P = 0.04) and 24 h after the last tDCS session (P = 0.006), for the active tDCS group only. There was increased withdrawal latency in the Von Frey test at 24 h after the last session (P = 0.01). Our findings confirm the hypothesis that tDCS induces significant, long-lasting, neuroplastic effects and expands these findings to a chronic pain model of peripheral inflammation, thus supporting the exploration of this technique in conditions associated with chronic pain and peripheral inflammation, such as osteoarthritis.", "pages": "306-15"}]
