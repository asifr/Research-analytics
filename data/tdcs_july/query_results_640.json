It is possible to use non-invasive methods of brain stimulation in humans (transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation) to study and even manipulate these processes. Initial studies are now underway to test whether modification of synaptic plasticity by neurostimulation can improve the recovery of motor function in patients after stroke.", "pages": "153-7"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with skull defects and skull plates: high-resolution computational FEM study of factors altering cortical current flow.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "19371866", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Preliminary positive results of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in enhancing the effects of cognitive and motor training indicate that this technique might also be beneficial in traumatic brain injury or patients who had decompressive craniectomy for trauma and cerebrovascular disease. One perceived hurdle is the presence of skull defects or skull plates in these patients that would hypothetically alter the intensity and location of current flow through the brain. We aimed to model tDCS using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived finite element head model with several conceptualized skull injuries. Cortical electric field (current density) peak intensities and distributions were compared with the healthy (skull intact) case. The factors of electrode position (C3-supraorbital or O1-supraorbital), electrode size skull defect size, skull defect state (acute and chronic) or skull plate (titanium and acrylic) were analyzed. If and how electric current through the brain was modulated by defects was found to depend on a specific combination of factors. For example, the condition that led to largest increase in peak cortical electric field was when one electrode was placed directly over a moderate sized skull defect. In contrast, small defects midway between electrodes did not significantly change cortical currents. As the conductivity of large skull defects/plates was increased (chronic to acute to titanium), current was shunted away from directly underlying cortex and concentrated in cortex underlying the defect perimeter. The predictions of this study are the first step to assess safety of transcranial electrical therapy in subjects with skull injuries and skull plates.", "pages": "153-7"}, {"volume": "66", "title": "Direct current stimulation promotes BDNF-dependent synaptic plasticity: potential implications for motor learning.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16033688", "authors": ["Fritsch, B", "Reis, J", "Martinowich, K", "Schambra, HM", "Ji, Y", "Cohen, LG", "Lu, B"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuron", "abstract": "Despite its increasing use in experimental and clinical settings, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain unknown. Anodal tDCS applied to the human motor cortex (M1) improves motor skill learning. Here, we demonstrate in mouse M1 slices that DCS induces a long-lasting synaptic potentiation (DCS-LTP), which is polarity specific, NMDA receptor dependent, and requires coupling of DCS with repetitive low-frequency synaptic activation (LFS). Combined DCS and LFS enhance BDNF-secretion and TrkB activation, and DCS-LTP is absent in BDNF and TrkB mutant mice, suggesting that BDNF is a key mediator of this phenomenon. Moreover, the BDNF val66met polymorphism known to partially affect activity-dependent BDNF secretion impairs motor skill acquisition in humans and mice. Motor learning is enhanced by anodal tDCS, as long as activity-dependent BDNF secretion is in place. We propose that tDCS may improve motor skill learning through augmentation of synaptic plasticity that requires BDNF secretion and TrkB activation within M1.", "pages": "153-7"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Using transcranial direct-current stimulation to treat stroke patients with aphasia.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "18394661", "authors": ["Baker, JM", "Rorden, C", "Fridriksson, J"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Recent research suggests that increased left hemisphere cortical activity, primarily of the left frontal cortex, is associated with improved naming performance in stroke patients with aphasia.
