While tDCS has been used to alter functions tied to primary motor and visual cortices, its impact on extrastriate visual areas involved in visuo-spatial processing has not yet been examined. In the current study, we applied tDCS to the cat visuoparietal (VP) cortex and assayed performance in a paradigm designed to assess the capacity to detect, localize and orient to static targets appearing at different spatial eccentricities within the visual field. Real or sham cathodal tDCS was unilaterally applied to the VP cortex, and orienting performance was assessed during (online), immediately after (offline; Experiments 1 and 2), and 1 or 24 h after the end of the tDCS stimulation (Experiment 2). Performance was compared to baseline data collected immediately prior to stimulation. Real, but not sham, tDCS induced significant decreases in performance for static visual targets presented in the contrastimulated visual hemifield. The behavioral impact of tDCS was most apparent during the online and immediate offline periods. The tDCS effect decayed progressively over time and performance returned to baseline levels approximately 60 min after stimulation. These results are consistent with the effects of both invasive and non-invasive deactivation methods applied to the same brain region, and indicate that tDCS has the potential to modify neuronal activity in extrastriate visual regions and to sculpt brain activity and behavior in normal and neurologically impaired subjects.", "pages": "409-17"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation over somatosensory cortex decreases experimentally induced acute pain perception.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18180638", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Brepohl, N", "Poreisz, C", "Boros, K", "Csifcsak, G", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Clinical journal of pain", "abstract": "Multiple cortical areas including the primary somatosensory cortex are known to be involved in nociception.

Loss or dysregulation of cholinergic inputs leads to cognitive impairments like those manifested in Alzheimer's disease. Such dysfunction can be at least partially restored by an increase of acetylcholine (ACh). In animal studies, ACh selectively facilitates long-term excitability changes induced by feed-forward afferent input. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that ACh enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of input processing. However, the neurophysiological foundation for its ability to enhance cognition in humans is not well documented. In this study we explore the effects of rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on global and synapse-specific forms of cortical plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and paired associative stimulation (PAS) on 10-12 healthy subjects, respectively. Rivastigmine essentially blocked the induction of the global excitability enhancement elicited by anodal tDCS and revealed a tendency to first reduce and then stabilize cathodal tDCS-induced inhibitory aftereffects. However, ACh enhanced the synapse-specific excitability enhancement produced by facilitatory PAS and consolidated the inhibitory PAS-induced excitability diminution. These findings are in line with a cholinergic focusing effect that optimizes the detection of relevant signals during information processing in humans.", "pages": "409-17"}, {"volume": "24 Suppl 1", "title": "Brain stimulation in poststroke rehabilitation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18055832", "authors": ["Alonso-Alonso, M", "Fregni, F", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)", "abstract": "Studying social behavior often requires the simultaneous interaction of many subjects.
