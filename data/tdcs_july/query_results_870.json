The present study investigated the causal role of the left supramarginal gyrus in short-term pitch memory by comparing the effects of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation when applied over the left or right supramarginal gyrus with sham transcranial direct current stimulation. Only cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the left supramarginal gyrus had a detrimental effect on short-term pitch-memory performance in 11 adult participants. These results provide support for the important role of the left supramarginal gyrus in short-term memory for pitch information, and they further demonstrate the potential of transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate the functional contribution of a brain area to a particular cognitive process.", "pages": "1047-50"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Modeling the current distribution during transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "16603933", "authors": ["Miranda, PC", "Lomarev, M", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To investigate the spatial distribution of the magnitude and direction of the current density in the human head during transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).", "pages": "1047-50"}, {"volume": "96", "title": "Origin of facilitation of motor-evoked potentials after paired magnetic stimulation: direct recording of epidural activity in conscious humans.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11733710", "authors": ["Di Lazzaro, V", "Pilato, F", "Oliviero, A", "Dileone, M", "Saturno, E", "Mazzone, P", "Insola, A", "Profice, P", "Ranieri, F", "Capone, F", "Tonali, PA", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The current density distribution was calculated using a numerical method to implement a standard spherical head model into which current was injected by means of large electrodes.

This is known as intracortical facilitation (ICF). We recorded descending volleys produced by single and paired magnetic motor cortex stimulation through high cervical epidural electrodes implanted for pain relief in six conscious patients. At interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 10 and 15 ms, although MEP was facilitated, there was no change in the amplitude or number of descending volleys. An additional I wave sometimes was observed at 25 ms ISI. In one subject, we also evaluated the effects of reversing the direction of the induced current in the brain. At 10 ms ISI, the facilitation of the MEPs disappeared and was replaced by slight suppression; at 2 ms ISI, there was a pronounced facilitation of epidural volleys. Subsequent experiments on healthy subjects showed that a conditioning stimulus capable of producing ICF of MEPs had no effect on the EMG response evoked by transmastoidal electrical stimulation of corticospinal tract. We conclude that ICF occurs because either 1) the conditioning stimulus has a (thus far undetected) effect on spinal cord excitability that increases its response to the same amplitude test volley or 2) that it can alter the composition (but not the amplitude) of the descending volleys set up by the test stimulus such that a larger proportion of the activity is destined for the target muscle.", "pages": "1047-50"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation and the visual cortex.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "15706227", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation over the left motor area influenced both contralateral and ipsilateral finger sequence movements in seven healthy adults. Effects for the two hands were reversed: anodal stimulation improved right-hand performance significantly more than cathodal stimulation, whereas cathodal stimulation improved left-hand performance significantly more than anodal stimulation. The results show that stimulating a motor region directly, or indirectly by modulating activity in the homologous region on the opposite hemisphere, can affect motor skill acquisition, presumably by facilitating effective synaptic connectivity.

Here we aimed to study the effects of another, very safe technique of non-invasive brain stimulation--transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)--on pain control in patients with central pain due to traumatic spinal cord injury. Patients were randomized to receive sham or active motor tDCS (2mA, 20 min for 5 consecutive days). A blinded evaluator rated the pain using the visual analogue scale for pain, Clinician Global Impression and Patient Global Assessment. Safety was assessed with a neuropsychological battery and confounders with the evaluation of depression and anxiety changes. There was a significant pain improvement after active anodal stimulation of the motor cortex, but not after sham stimulation. These results were not confounded by depression or anxiety changes. Furthermore, cognitive performance was not significantly changed throughout the trial in both treatment groups. The results of our study suggest that this new approach of cortical stimulation can be effective to control pain in patients with spinal cord lesion.

This may be similar in humans, where dopamine influences learning and memory. We tested the role of dopamine in human cortical neuroplasticity. Changes of excitability were induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). D2 receptor blocking by sulpiride abolished the induction of after-effects nearly completely. D1 activation alone in the presence of D2 receptor blocking induced by co-administration of sulpiride and pergolide did not re-establish the excitability changes induced by tDCS. This suggests that D2 receptors play a major supporting role in inducing neuroplasticity in the human motor cortex. Enhancement of D2 and, to a lesser degree, D1 receptors by pergolide consolidated tDCS-generated excitability diminution until the morning after stimulation. The readiest explanation for this pattern of results is that D2 receptor activation has a consolidation-enhancing effect on tDCS-induced changes of excitability in the human cortex. The results of this study underscore the importance of the dopaminergic system for human neuroplasticity, suggest a first pharmacological add-on mechanism to prolong the excitability-diminishing effects of cathodal tDCS for up to 24 h after stimulation, and thus render the application of tDCS practicable in diseases displaying enhanced cortical excitability, e.g. migraine and epilepsy.", "pages": "1047-50"}]
