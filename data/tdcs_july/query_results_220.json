Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation can temporarily reduce motor cortex excitability. To test whether stimulation of the motor cortex can reduce dystonic symptoms in children, we measured tracking performance and muscle overflow using an electromyogram tracking task before and after stimulation. Of 10 participants, 3 showed a significant reduction in overflow, and a fourth showed a significant reduction in tracking error. Overflow decreased more when the hand contralateral to the cathode performed the task than when the hand ipsilateral to the cathode performed the task. Averaged over all participants, the results did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that cathodal stimulation may allow a subset of children to control muscles or reduce involuntary overflow activity. Further testing is needed to confirm these results in a blinded trial and identify the subset of children who are likely to respond.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation intensity and duration effects on tinnitus suppression.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "23032310", "authors": ["Shekhawat, GS", "Stinear, CM", "Searchfield, GD"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "Perception of sound in the absence of an external auditory source is called tinnitus, which may negatively affect quality of life.
