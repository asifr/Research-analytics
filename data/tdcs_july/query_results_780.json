An improved understanding of the complex circuitry underlying depressive disorders has fostered an explosion in the development of new, nonpharmacological approaches. Each of these treatments seeks to restore normal brain activity via electrical or magnetic stimulation. In this article, the authors discuss the ongoing evolution of neurostimulatory treatments for treatment-resistant depression, reviewing the methods, efficacy, and current research on electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, focal electrically administered stimulated seizure therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, chronic epidural cortical stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation. Special attention is given to deep brain stimulation, the most focally targeted approach. The history, purported mechanisms of action, and current research are outlined in detail. Although deep brain stimulation is the most invasive of the neurostimulatory treatments developed to date, it may hold significant promise in alleviating symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients with the most severe and disabling mood disorders.", "pages": "263-75"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Brain stimulation modulates driving behavior.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18684333", "authors": ["Beeli, G", "Koeneke, S", "Gasser, K", "Jancke, L"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Behavioral and brain functions : BBF", "abstract": "Driving a car is a complex task requiring coordinated functioning of distributed brain regions.

Whereas the relevance of this mechanism for neuroplasticity in humans has been ascertained on the neurophysiological level, its functional relevance remains unclear so far. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the pre-performance cortical activity and excitability state on subsequent performance practicing a visuomotor paradigm. Excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) or the visual area MT/V5 was modulated by 10 min of anodal or cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy subjects before practice of a visuomotor tracking task. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased significantly in the early phase of practice after both anodal and cathodal stimulations over both cortical areas compared to the no-stimulation condition showing a behavioral improvement at the beginning of the practice process. Stimulation of a control cortical area did not result in significant difference with regard to the practice between cathodal, anodal and sham stimulation. However, the steepness of improvement between the different time-points was significantly increased only at the beginning of the task, and was reduced at the 5'-10' (V5) and 10'-15' (M1) time-window with regard to anodal stimulation, compared to the 'no-stimulation' condition. With regard to cathodal stimulation, the steepness of improvement was significantly lower at the 10'-15' time-window (M1) compared to the 'no-stimulation' condition. The results of our study underline the principal functional relevance of the BCM rule for the efficacy of visuomotor practice, but imply that also other mechanisms have to be taken into account.", "pages": "263-75"}, {"volume": "441", "title": "Muscle-specific variations in use-dependent crossed-facilitation of corticospinal pathways mediated by transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "14705290", "authors": ["Carson, RG", "Kennedy, NC", "Linden, MA", "Britton, L"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "\"The feeling of being there\" is one possible way to describe the phenomenon of feeling present in a virtual environment and to act as if this environment is real.
