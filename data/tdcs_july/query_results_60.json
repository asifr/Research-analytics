BDNF serum levels have been found to be lower in depressed patients than in healthy subjects. In a couple of studies, effective antidepressant treatment including electroconvulsive therapy led to an increase in BDNF serum levels. As transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is currently discussed as novel therapeutic intervention in major depression, we investigated BDNF serum levels during tDCS in therapy-resistant depression. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with a major depressive episode participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial and received randomized cross over treatment with 2 weeks active and 2 weeks sham tDCS (1 or 2mA for 20min, anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cathode right supraorbital cortex). RESULTS: Clinical assessment only showed a modest and non-significant improvement in HAMD, BDI and CGI in both groups. BDNF serum levels were measured at baseline, after 2 and after 4 weeks. There was neither a significant change of BDNF levels following active tDCS, nor were severity of depressive symptoms and BDNF levels correlated. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size, its heterogeneity, the short observation period and a cross-over design without an interval between both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: tDCS did not change BDNF serum levels unlike other established antidepressant interventions in this treatment resistant sample. However, larger studies are needed.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Ipsilateral motor pathways after stroke: implications for non-invasive brain stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23658541", "authors": ["Bradnam, LV", "Stinear, CM", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "In humans the two cerebral hemispheres have essential roles in controlling the upper limb. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the potential importance of ipsilateral descending pathways for functional recovery after stroke, and the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS) protocols of the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1). Conventionally NBS is used to suppress contralesional M1, and to attenuate transcallosal inhibition onto the ipsilesional M1. There has been little consideration of the fact that contralesional M1 suppression may also reduce excitability of ipsilateral descending pathways that may be important for paretic upper limb control for some patients. One such ipsilateral pathway is the cortico-reticulo-propriospinal pathway (CRPP). In this review we outline a neurophysiological model to explain how contralesional M1 may gain control of the paretic arm via the CRPP. We conclude that the relative importance of the CRPP for motor control in individual patients must be considered before using NBS to suppress contralesional M1. Neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and clinical assessments can assist this decision making and facilitate the translation of NBS into the clinical setting.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Validation of finite element model of transcranial electrical stimulation using scalp potentials: implications for clinical dose.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "23649036", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Zhou, X", "Su, Y", "Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "During transcranial electrical stimulation, current passage across the scalp generates voltage across the scalp surface.

PPC also seems to have a key role in modulating visuospatial mechanisms, which are known to affect temporal performance. By applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left and right PPC, we aimed to modulate timing ability performance in healthy humans performing a cognitively controlled timing task. In two separate experiments we compared time-processing abilities of two groups of healthy adults submitted to anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS over right or left PPC, by employing a supra-second time reproduction task. Cathodal stimulation over the right PPC affected temporal accuracy by leading participants to overestimate time intervals. Moreover, when applied to the left PPC, it reduced variability in reproducing temporal intervals. No effect was reported for anodal stimulation. These results expand current knowledge on the role of the parietal cortex on temporal processing. We provide evidence that the parietal cortex of both hemispheres is involved in temporal processing by acting on distinct components of timing performance such as accuracy and variability.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Stimulating the Cerebellum Affects Visuomotor Adaptation but not Intermanual Transfer of Learning.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23625383", "authors": ["Block, H", "Celnik, P"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique that moderates cognitive and motor function. The effects of tDCS on cognitive and motor tasks vary among individuals. However, the source of the inter-individual variability remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the effect of bilateral tDCS on the performance of mental calculations differs among individuals according to the functional lateralization of parietal activity observed during a mental calculation task. Sixteen healthy subjects (11 males and five females, aged 20-23 years) participated. Laterality of parietal activity during a mental calculation task was evaluated using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects also performed the mental calculation task pre-, during-, 30min post-, and 60min post-tDCS. Bilateral tDCS with the anode over the left parietal cortex and the cathode over the right parietal cortex shortened response times of the mental calculation task in subjects with left-hemispheric parietal lateralization, but not in subjects with bilateral parietal activation. This indicates that inter-individual variability in laterality of brain activity might be an important factor underlying the effect of bilateral tDCS. In conclusion, bilateral tDCS over the parietal cortex enhanced the performance of mental calculations in subjects with left-hemispheric parietal lateralization.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Impact of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF polymorphisms on response to sertraline versus transcranial direct current stimulation: Implications for the serotonergic system.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23615118", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Kemp, AH", "Shiozawa, P", "Cordeiro, Q", "Valiengo, LC", "Goulart, AC", "Coprerski, B", "Lotufo, PA", "Brunoni, D", "Perez, AB", "Fregni, F", "Bense\u00f1or, IM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising nonpharmacological therapy for major depression.
