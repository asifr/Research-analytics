Several recent studies found an improvement of depressive symptoms in drug-free patients. Here we report the case of a 66-year-old female patient suffering from recurrent major depressive episodes who underwent anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral PFC over 4 weeks as an add-on treatment to a stable antidepressant medication. Only a modest improvement of depressive symptoms was observed after tDCS, i.e. reduction of the baseline scores in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from 23 to 19 and in the Beck Depression Inventory from 27 to 20. However, there was an increase from 52 to 90% in the Regensburg Verbal Fluency Test. In addition, EEG was used to assess the acute effects of tDCS. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed a left unilateral focal effect (25-40% reduced power) in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. The same effect appeared in the surface analysis of the EEG. The absolute, as well as the relative power decreased significantly in the delta, theta and alpha bands after a comparison of the spectral analysis. Though tDCS over 4 weeks did not exert clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in this case of therapy-resistant depression, the findings for cognitive measures and EEG suggest that beneficial effects may occur in depressed subjects and future studies need to further explore this approach also in therapy-resistant major depression.", "pages": "632-5"}, {"volume": "73", "title": "Blepharospasm and the modulation of cortical excitability in primary and secondary motor areas.", "issue": "23", "pmid": "19996078", "authors": ["Kranz, G", "Shamim, EA", "Lin, PT", "Kranz, GS", "Voller, B", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Traditionally, benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is considered a disorder caused by basal ganglia dysfunction.

Knowledge of the current density distribution is an important factor in optimizing such applications of tDCS. We use the finite element method to compare three different models in tDCS, where the stimulation electrodes (EEG electrodes) are placed in the 10-10 international system coordinates. We studied the focality and the distribution of the current density in depth and at the surface of the brain for three different electrode configurations. We show that the use of EEG electrodes increases the focality of tDCS, especially when one cathode and several anodes are used. Additionally, these electrodes need less injected current, can be placed at scalp positions whose relationship with the underlying cerebral cortex are known and allow the use of tDCS and EEG recording concomitantly.", "pages": "632-5"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Pharmacological and combined interventions for the acute depressive episode: focus on efficacy and tolerability.", "issue": "", "pmid": "12140667", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Fraguas, R", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Therapeutics and clinical risk management", "abstract": "The neocortex is the most common target of sub-dural electrotherapy and non-invasive brain stimulation modalities including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current simulation (tDCS). Specific neuronal elements targeted by cortical stimulation are considered to underlie therapeutic effects, but the exact cell-type(s) affected by these methods remains poorly understood. We determined if neuronal morphology predicted responses to subthreshold uniform electric fields. We characterized the effects of subthreshold electrical stimulation on identified cortical neurons in vitro. Uniform electric fields were applied to rat motor cortex brain slices, while recording from interneurons and pyramidal cells across cortical layers, using whole cell patch clamp. Neuron morphology was reconstructed following intracellular dialysis of biocytin. Based solely on volume-weighted morphology, we developed a simplified model of neuronal polarization by sub-threshold electric field: an electrotonically linear cylinder that further predicts polarization at distal dendritic tree terminations. We found that neuronal morphology correlated with somatic sub-threshold polarization. Layer V/VI pyramidal neuron somata (individually) and dendrites (averaging across neurons) were most sensitive to sub-threshold fields. This analysis was extended to predict a terminal polarization of a human cortical neuron as 1.44 mV during tDCS.", "pages": "632-5"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Response-dependent contributions of human primary motor cortex and angular gyrus to manual and perceptual sequence learning.", "issue": "48", "pmid": "12686268", "authors": ["Rosenthal, CR", "Roche-Kelly, EE", "Husain, M", "Kennard, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure where a weak electrical current is applied across the scalp to modulate brain function.

We have developed novel technology for tDCS that improves spatial focality at the cost of increased stimulation electrode current density; high density tDCS (HD-tDCS). The goal of this paper was to provide information on the thermal effects of tDCS using a MRI-derived finite element human head model. The tissue temperature increases of tDCS using conventional rectangular-pad (7 x 5 cm(2)) and HD-tDCS using the ring (4 x 1) electrode configurations were compared using a bio-heat model.

However, knowledge on how exactly tDCS affects the activity of neurons in the brain is still not sufficient. Precise analysis on the electromagnetic effect of tDCS on the brain requires finite element analysis (FEA) with realistic head models including anisotropy of the white matter and the skull. In this paper, we have simulated tDCS via 3-D high-resolution FEA and investigated the effect of tissue anisotropy on tDCS. The results show that the skull anisotropy induces a strong shunting effect, causing a shift of the stimulated areas, and the white matter anisotropy affects strongly the current flow directions, changing the current field distribution inside the human brain.
