Numerous experimental studies suggests that a maladaptive plasticity of the auditory and limbic cortical areas may underlie tinnitus. Accordingly, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been repeatedly used with success to reduce tinnitus intensity. The potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), another promising method of noninvasive brain stimulation, to relieve tinnitus has not been explored systematically. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled and balanced order design, 20 patients suffering from chronic untreatable tinnitus were submitted to 20 minutes of 1 mA anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS targeting the left temporoparietal area. The primary outcome measure was a change in tinnitus intensity or discomfort assessed with a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) change-scale immediately after tDCS and 1 hour later. Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly reduced tinnitus intensity immediately after stimulation; whereas cathodal tDCS failed to do so. The variances of the tinnitus intensity and discomfort VAS change-scales increased dramatically after anodal and cathodal tDCS, whereas they remained virtually unchanged after sham tDCS. Moreover, several patients unexpectedly reported longer-lasting effects (at least several days) such as tinnitus improvement, worsening, or changes in tinnitus features, more frequently after real than sham tDCS. Anodal tDCS is a promising therapeutic tool for modulating tinnitus perception. Moreover, both anodal and cathodal tDCS seem able to alter tinnitus perception and could, thus, be used to trigger plastic changes.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of focal hand dystonia.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "63862", "authors": ["Benninger, DH", "Lomarev, M", "Lopez, G", "Pal, N", "Luckenbaugh, DA", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "In recent years, two techniques have become available for the non-invasive stimulation of human motor cortex: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The effects of TMS and tDCS when applied over motor cortex should be considered with regard not only to cortical circuits but also to spinal motor circuits. The different modes of action and specificity of TMS and tDCS suggest that their effects on spinal network excitability may be different from that in the cortex. Until now, the effects of tDCS on lumbar spinal network excitability have never been studied. In this series of experiments, on healthy subjects, we studied the effects of anodal tDCS over the lower limb motor cortex on (i) reciprocal Ia inhibition projecting from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) to the soleus (SOL), (ii) presynaptic inhibition of SOL Ia terminals, (iii) homonymous SOL recurrent inhibition, and (iv) SOL H-reflex recruitment curves. The results show that anodal tDCS decreases reciprocal Ia inhibition, increases recurrent inhibition and induces no modification of presynaptic inhibition of SOL Ia terminals and of SOL-H reflex recruitment curves. Our results indicate therefore that the effects of tDCS are the opposite of those previously described for TMS on spinal network excitability. They also indicate that anodal tDCS induces effects on spinal network excitability similar to those observed during co-contraction suggesting that anodal tDCS activates descending corticospinal projections mainly involved in co-contractions.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for chronic pain.

For each electrode montage, clinical effects were correlated with predictions of induced cortical current flow using magnetic resonance imaging-derived finite element method head model. Thirty patients were randomized into 5 groups (Cathodal-M1 [primary motor cortex], Cathodal-SO [supra-orbital area], Anodal-M1, Anodal-SO, and Sham) to receive tDCS application (2 mA, 20 minutes) using an extracephalic montage. Pain was measured using a visual numerical scale (VNS), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and a body diagram (BD) evaluating pain area. There was significant pain reduction in cathodal-SO and anodal-SO groups indexed by VNS. For PPT there was a trend for a similar effect in anodal-SO group. Computer simulation indicated that the M1-extracephalic montage produced dominantly temporo-parietal current flow, consistent with lack of clinical effects with this montage. Conversely, the SO-extracephalic montage produced current flow across anterior prefrontal structures, thus supporting the observed analgesic effects. Our clinical and modeling findings suggest that electrode montage, considering both electrodes, is critical for the clinical effects of M1-tDCS as electric current needs to be induced in areas associated with the pain matrix. These results should be taken into consideration for the design of pain tDCS studies.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "183", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation over Broca's region improves phonemic and semantic fluency in healthy individuals.", "issue": "", "pmid": "7252877", "authors": ["Cattaneo, Z", "Pisoni, A", "Papagno, C"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Results in this article support that electrode montage is a critical factor to consider for the clinical application of tDCS for pain control, as there is an important correlation between the location of induced electrical current and tDCS-induced analgesic effects.", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "73", "title": "Feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation for decreasing post-ERCP pain: a randomized, sham-controlled, pilot study.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "17192785", "authors": ["Borckardt, JJ", "Romagnuolo, J", "Reeves, ST", "Madan, A", "Frohman, H", "Beam, W", "George, MS"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Gastrointestinal endoscopy", "abstract": "This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a combination of excitatory anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the contralateral motor cortex and inhibitory cathodal tDCS to the ipsilateral motor cortex of the motor performing hand (Bi-tDCS) would elicit more implicit motor sequence learning than anodal tDCS applied to the contralateral motor cortex alone (Uni-tDCS).", "pages": "611-27"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Mechanisms of aphasia recovery after stroke and the role of noninvasive brain stimulation.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "17502554", "authors": ["Hamilton, RH", "Chrysikou, EG", "Coslett, B"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain and language", "abstract": "Eleven healthy right-handed adults underwent a randomized crossover experiment of Uni-tDCS, Bi-tDCS, or sham stimulation.
