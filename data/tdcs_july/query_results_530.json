Recent studies have demonstrated that many clinical populations, such as people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, exhibit difficulties in inhibitory control. One prefrontal area that has been particularly associated with inhibitory control is the pre-supplementary motor area (Pre-SMA). Here we applied non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over Pre-SMA to test its role in this behavior. tDCS allows for current to be applied in two directions to selectively excite or suppress the neural activity of Pre-SMA. Our results showed that anodal tDCS improved efficiency of inhibitory control. Conversely, cathodal tDCS showed a tendency towards impaired inhibitory control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of non-invasive intervention tDCS altering subjects' inhibitory control. These results further our understanding of the neural bases of inhibitory control and suggest a possible therapeutic intervention method for clinical populations.", "pages": "2249-57"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Activation of inhibition: diminishing impulsive behavior by direct current stimulation over the inferior frontal gyrus.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "21452949", "authors": ["Jacobson, L", "Javitt, DC", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "A common feature of human existence is the ability to reverse decisions after they are made but before they are implemented. This cognitive control process, termed response inhibition, refers to the ability to inhibit an action once initiated and has been localized to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) based on functional imaging and brain lesion studies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that can facilitate as well as impair cortical function. To explore whether response inhibition can be improved through rIFG electrical stimulation, we administered focal tDCS before subjects performed the stop signal task (SST), which measures response inhibition. Notably, activation of the rIFG by unilateral anodal stimulation significantly improved response inhibition, relative to a sham condition, whereas the same tDCS protocol did not affect response time in the go trials of the SST and in a control task. Furthermore, the SST was not affected by tDCS at a control site, the right angular gyrus. Our results are the first demonstration of response inhibition improvement with brain stimulation over rIFG and further confirm the rIFG involvement in this task. Although this study was conducted in healthy subjects, present findings with anodal rIFG stimulation support the use of similar paradigms for the treatment of cognitive control impairments in pathological conditions.", "pages": "2249-57"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "[New techniques of electrical and magnetic stimulation in treatment of depression--comparison with electroconvulsive treatment and pharmacotherapy].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "21449168", "authors": ["Zyss, T"], "year": "", "journal": "Psychiatria polska", "abstract": "Search for new therapeutic methods applied in psychiatric disorders, especially in depression--concern not only pharmacotherapy, but also physical techniques.

The trancranial magnetic stimulation TMS, vagus nerve stimulation VNS, magnetic seizure therapy/magnetoconvulsive therapy MST/MCT, deep brain stimulation DBS, and trancranial direct current stimulation tDCS are involved among these techniques.

Interictal epileptiform discharges, on the other hand, are not specific enough for SOZ as they are recorded at zones other than the SOZ; they are also recorded from areas that do not generate the ictal pattern and from areas to which ictal discharges propagate. Besides spikes and sharp waves, a novel index of human epileptogenicity has been investigated in association with wide-band electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. We primarily noted the following during clinical neurophysiological analysis for clinical epilepsy. (1) Recent development of digital EEG technology enabled us to record wide-band EEG in a clinical setting. Thus, high frequency (>200 Hz) and low frequency (<1 Hz) components can be reliably recorded using subdural electrodes. Direct current shift, slow shift, ripple, and fast ripple can be well delineated, and they will be potentially useful in the diagnosis and management of epileptic patients. (2) Fiber tractography (morphological parameter) and cortico-cortical-evoked potentials with single cortical stimulation (electrophysiological parameter) elucidated cortico-cortical connections in human brain. The data thus obtained can help us understand the mechanism of seizure propagation and normal cortical functional connectivity. (3) Non-invasive simultaneous recording of EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided information on the roles of deep brain structures associated with scalp-recorded epileptiform discharges. Interventional neurophysiology can shed light on the non-pharmacological treatment of epilepsy.

It has been demonstrated that bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can reduce tinnitus. In this study, one group of patients reported a substantial improvement in their tinnitus perception, whereas another group described minor or no beneficial effect at all. The objective was to verify whether the activity and connectivity of the resting brain is different for people who will respond to bifrontal tDCS for tinnitus in comparison with non-responders. Higher gamma band activity was demonstrated in right primary and secondary auditory cortex and right parahippocampus for responders. It has been shown that gamma band activity in the auditory cortex is correlated with tinnitus loudness and that the anterior cingulate is involved in tinnitus distress. People who were going to respond to bifrontal tDCS also demonstrated an increased functional connectivity in the gamma band between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right parahippocampus as well as the right DLPFC and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). An analysis revealed that responders to bifrontal tDCS also experienced a larger suppression effect on TMS placed over the right temporal cortex (i.e. auditory cortex) than non-responders. Responders to bifrontal tDCS seem to differ in resting brain activity compared to non-responders in the right auditory cortex and parahippocampal area. They also have a different functional connectivity between DLPFC and, respectively, the sgACC and parahippocampal area. These connectivities might explain the suppression effect for both tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related distress.", "pages": "2249-57"}]
