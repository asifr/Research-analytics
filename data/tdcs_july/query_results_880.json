The guiding theory is that impairment of hand function is exacerbated by learned non-use and that this in turn leads to a loss of cortical representation of the upper limb. It is claimed that these processes can be reversed by two weeks of constraint of the unaffected limb combined with intensive practice in use of the paretic hand, and numerous small-scale studies have suggested that CIMT can lead to large improvements in function more than a year after stroke. However, the theory of learned non-use is open to question and there is uncertainty about the nature of the improvements induced by CIMT. The greatest effect seems to be increased spontaneous use of the hand, either through reduction of learned non-use or by overcoming the sense of effort during movement. There is also evidence of some improvement on dexterity tests but no studies have analysed in detail whether this reflects reduction of basic motor impairment or learning of compensatory movement strategies. The current weight of evidence is in favour of compensatory learning. Cortical changes detected by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or functional imaging may reflect this compensatory motor skill learning rather than restoration of representations lost due to the infarct or non-use of the limb. If future studies confirm this then the clinical implication is that direct teaching of unimanual or bimanual compensatory strategies might be a more productive approach than constraint.", "pages": "81-96"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Motor evoked potential monitoring during cerebral aneurysm surgery: technical aspects and comparison of transcranial and direct cortical stimulation.", "issue": "4 Suppl", "pmid": "16234682", "authors": ["Szel\u00e9nyi, A", "Kothbauer, K", "de Camargo, AB", "Langer, D", "Flamm, ES", "Deletis, V"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "This study evaluates technical aspects, handling, and safety of intraoperatively applied transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) for eliciting muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs) during cerebral aneurysm surgery.", "pages": "81-96"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Recharging cognition with DC brain polarization.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "16182596", "authors": ["Wassermann, EM", "Grafman, J"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Trends in cognitive sciences", "abstract": "In 119 patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm surgery, mMEPs were evoked by a train of five stimuli with individual pulse duration of 0.5 milliseconds, a repetition rate of 2 Hz, and constant current anodal stimulation.

It is closely related to modulation of cortical excitability and activity which are key mechanisms for modulating neuroplasticity. Long-term potentiation and long-term depression-like effects have been shown to be involved in learning processes in animal studies so far. Stimulation with weak direct currents is capable of inducing stimulation-polarity-dependent, prolonged, diminutions or elevations of cortical activity and excitability, most probably elicited by a hyper- or depolarisation of resting membrane potentials. Moreover, these modulations are functionally important, since they affect learning processes and epileptic activity. Here excitability changes have been accomplished in the human by non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). They share some important features with these well-known neuroplastic changes: The duration of the effects depends on stimulation duration and intensity, they are of intracortical origin, and the prolonged effects depend on NMDA-receptor activity. Thus, this technique is a promising method in the field of neuroplastic research in animals and humans and could evolve as a therapeutic tool in some neuro-psychiatric disorders which benefit from modulation of cortical excitability.", "pages": "81-96"}, {"volume": "568", "title": "Modulating parameters of excitability during and after transcranial direct current stimulation of the human motor cortex.", "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "16037080", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Seeber, A", "Frommann, K", "Klein, CC", "Rochford, C", "Nitsche, MS", "Fricke, K", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W", "Tergau, F"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor hand area (M1) can produce lasting polarity-specific effects on corticospinal excitability and motor learning in humans. In 16 healthy volunteers, O positron emission tomography (PET) of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest and during finger movements was used to map lasting changes in regional synaptic activity following 10 min of tDCS (+/-1 mA). Bipolar tDCS was given through electrodes placed over the left M1 and right frontopolar cortex. Eight subjects received anodal or cathodal tDCS of the left M1, respectively. When compared to sham tDCS, anodal and cathodal tDCS induced widespread increases and decreases in rCBF in cortical and subcortical areas. These changes in rCBF were of the same magnitude as task-related rCBF changes during finger movements and remained stable throughout the 50-min period of PET scanning. Relative increases in rCBF after real tDCS compared to sham tDCS were found in the left M1, right frontal pole, right primary sensorimotor cortex and posterior brain regions irrespective of polarity. With the exception of some posterior and ventral areas, anodal tDCS increased rCBF in many cortical and subcortical regions compared to cathodal tDCS. Only the left dorsal premotor cortex demonstrated an increase in movement related activity after cathodal tDCS, however, modest compared with the relatively strong movement-independent effects of tDCS. Otherwise, movement related activity was unaffected by tDCS. Our results indicate that tDCS is an effective means of provoking sustained and widespread changes in regional neuronal activity.

In this study we investigated the effect of cathodal DC stimulation on spontaneous neural activity and on motor responses evoked by stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system. We studied 17 healthy volunteers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) of the motor area were used to study the effects of cathodal tDCS (1.5 mA, 10 min) on resting motor threshold and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in response to cathodal tDCS was analysed by power spectral density (PSD). Motor axonal excitability changes in response to transcutaneous DC stimulation of the ulnar nerve (0.3 mA, 10 min) were assessed by testing changes in the size of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) elicited by submaximal nerve stimulation. Cathodal tDCS over the motor area for 10 min increased the motor threshold and decreased the size of MEPs evoked by TMS for at least 60 min after current offset (t(0) 71.7 +/- 5%, t(20) 50.8 +/- 11%, t(40) 47.7 +/- 7.7%, and t(60) 39.7 +/- 6.4%, P < 0.01). The tDCS also significantly decreased the size of MEPs elicited by TES (t(0) 64 +/- 16.4%, P = 0.09; t(20) 67.6 +/- 10.8%, P = 0.06; and t(40) 58.3 +/- 9.9%, P < 0.05). At the same time in the EEG the power of delta (2-4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) rhythms increased (delta 181.1 +/- 40.2, P < 0.05; and theta 138.7 +/- 27.6, P = 0.07). At the peripheral level cathodal DC stimulation increased the size of the ulnar nerve CMAP (175 +/- 34.3%, P < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that the after-effects of tDCS have a non-synaptic mechanism of action based upon changes in neural membrane function. These changes apart from reflecting local changes in ionic concentrations, could arise from alterations in transmembrane proteins and from electrolysis-related changes in [H(+)] induced by exposure to constant electric field.", "pages": "81-96"}]
