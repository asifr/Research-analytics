The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections of M1 exhibit short-term and long-term plasticity, which is a strong substrate for learning-related map reorganization. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for few minutes over M1 has been shown to induce relatively long-lasting plastic alterations and to modulate motor performance. Here we test the hypothesis that the relatively long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1 results in the alteration of associations among populations of M1 neurons which may be reflected in changes of its functional architecture. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10 minutes of tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left M1. For each functional dataset, grey-matter voxels belonging to Brodmann area 4 (BA4) were labelled and afterwards BA4 voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal network parameters which characterize the architecture of functional networks (connectivity degree, clustering coefficient and characteristic path-length) were computed, transformed to volume maps and compared before and after stimulation. At the dorsolateral-BA4 region cathodal tDCS boosted local connectedness, while anodal-tDCS enhanced long distance functional communication within M1. Additionally, the more efficient the functional architecture of M1 was at baseline, the more efficient the tDCS-induced functional modulations were. In summary, we show here that it is possible to non-invasively reorganize the intrinsic functional architecture of M1, and to image such alterations.", "pages": "994-1001"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Swallowing neurorehabilitation: from the research laboratory to routine clinical application.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Doeltgen, SH", "Huckabee, ML"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation", "abstract": "Excitatory anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can improve human cognitive functions, but neural underpinnings of its mode of action remain elusive. In a cross-over placebo (\"sham\") controlled study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neurofunctional correlates of improved language functions induced by atDCS over a core language area, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Intrascanner transcranial direct current stimulation-induced changes in overt semantic word generation assessed behavioral modulation; task-related and task-independent (resting-state) fMRI characterized language network changes. Improved word-retrieval during atDCS was paralleled by selectively reduced task-related activation in the left ventral IFG, an area specifically implicated in semantic retrieval processes. Under atDCS, resting-state fMRI revealed increased connectivity of the left IFG and additional major hubs overlapping with the language network. In conclusion, atDCS modulates endogenous low-frequency oscillations in a distributed set of functionally connected brain areas, possibly inducing more efficient processing in critical task-relevant areas and improved behavioral performance.", "pages": "994-1001"}, {"volume": "1439", "title": "Oppositional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of parietal substrates of attention during encoding modulates episodic memory.", "issue": "", "pmid": "11039938", "authors": ["Jacobson, L", "Goren, N", "Lavidor, M", "Levy, DA"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Tinnitus is considered an auditory phantom percept. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a new approach for tinnitus treatment including, as potential targets of interest, either the temporal and temporoparietal cortex or prefrontal areas. This study investigates and compares the spatial distribution of the magnitude of the electric field and the current density in the brain tissues during tDCS of different brain targets. A numerical method was applied on a realistic human head model to calculate these field distributions in different brain structures, such as the cortex, white matter, cerebellum, hippocampus, medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Moreover, the same distributions were evaluated along the auditory pathways. Results of this study show that tDCS of the left temporoparietal cortex resulted in a widespread diffuse distribution of the magnitude of the electric fields (and also of the current density) on an area of the cortex larger than the target brain region. On the contrary, tDCS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex resulted in a stimulation mainly concentrated on the target itself. Differences in the magnitude distribution were also found on the structures along the auditory pathways. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, varying the electrode position and the human head models. Accurate estimation of the field distribution during tDCS in different regions of the head could be valuable to better determine and predict efficacy of tDCS for tinnitus suppression.", "pages": "994-1001"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Combined central and peripheral stimulation to facilitate motor recovery after stroke: the effect of number of sessions on outcome.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11258382", "authors": ["Lindenberg, R", "Zhu, LL", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "Vision Restoration Therapy (VRT) aims to improve visual field function by systematically training regions of residual vision associated with the activity of suboptimal firing neurons within the occipital cortex.
