The mechanisms by which tDCS produces these behavioral effects are currently uncertain. One hypothesis is that anodal tDCS leads to increased metabolic activity in the brain, which enhances cognitive and memory processes. Here we examined the neuronal mechanisms by which tDCS influences learning by measuring changes in brain metabolite concentrations using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (\u00b9H MRS). As perception and learning can also influence neurochemistry, here we applied tDCS during rest. MRS data was obtained before and after 2.0 mA of anodal tDCS was applied for 30 min over electrode site P4, with the cathode placed on the contralateral arm. MRS data were acquired from the right parietal lobe beneath the anodal tDCS electrode, and from the homologous regions of the left hemisphere once before and once after tDCS. Significantly higher combined glutamate and glutamine levels were found in right parietal cortex, beneath the stimulating electrode, with non-significant increases in homologous regions of the opposite hemisphere. In addition, a significant interaction between hemispheres was found for tDCS effects on tNAA. These results suggest that changes in glutamatergic activity and tNAA may be related to the mechanisms by which tDCS influences learning and behavior.", "pages": "67-71"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Distractibility during episodic retrieval is exacerbated by perturbation of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "21680847", "authors": ["Wais, PE", "Kim, OY", "Gazzaley, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "The presence of irrelevant external stimuli during the retrieval of long-term memory (LTM) has a negative impact on the fidelity of recollected details. Top-down control processes that both guide the selection of internal information relevant to LTM goals and resolve interference on retrieval from irrelevant external information have been associated with the same region in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). The current study examined a causal role of the left VLPFC in memory performance when external distraction (i.e., visual stimuli irrelevant to the current task goals) was presented during retrieval of LTM. Immediately after functional perturbation of the left VLPFC with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, participants' memory was tested when their eyes were closed and when their eyes were open and irrelevant visual stimuli were presented. The results showed that visual distraction diminished LTM performance based on an objective measure of recollection and that perturbation of left VLPFC exacerbated the disruptive effect. This is the first evidence of a direct role of the left VLPFC in diminishing the impact of distraction on recollection, elucidating neural mechanisms that are critically involved in how we reconstruct the past while navigating the external environment.", "pages": "67-71"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation does not modulate motor cortex excitability in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15102907", "authors": ["Munneke, MA", "Stegeman, DF", "Hengeveld, YA", "Rongen, JJ", "Schelhaas, HJ", "Zwarts, MJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease caused by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons.
