We hypothesised that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) should facilitate language acquisition in a cohort (n\u2009=\u200910) of children with immature syntax. We modified the English version of the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) to test only basic canonical subject-verb-object sentences. We tested syntactic accuracy after teaching then testing all vocabulary from the subsequent syntax test to ensure validity of syntactic scoring. We used scaffolding sentences for syntax training. All procedures were performed both before and after tDCS. Results demonstrated a large effect size of the difference between pre-/post-tDCS groups (p < 0.0005, d\u2009=\u20092.78), indicating syntax acquisition. Combining a modified BAT with tDCS constitutes effective modalities for assessment and treatment of immature syntax in children with autism.

TDCS has been recently used as investigational intervention for major depression and treatment resistant depression (TRD) with encouraging results. The present study was aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of tDCS in major depressives with poor response to pharmacological treatment. Twenty-three depressed patients, with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, were treated with augmentative tDCS for 5 days, two sessions per day in a blind-rater trial. The course of depressive symptoms was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA for HAM-D and MADRS total scores. A qualitative analysis on the basis of the HAM-D response was performed as well. Both analyses were conducted at three time-points: T0 (baseline), T1 (endpoint tDCS) and T2 (end of the first week of follow-up). All patients completed the trial without relevant side-effects. A significant reduction of HAM-D and MADRS total scores was observed during the study (P<0.0001). Treatment response (endpoint HAM-D reduction \u226550%) was obtained by four patients (17.4%) at T1 and by seven patients (30.4%) at T2 and remission (endpoint HAM-D<8) by three patients (13.0%) at T1 and by four subjects (17.4%) at T2. Present findings support the efficacy and good tolerability of tDCS in the acute treatment of patients with TRD with clinical benefit being progressive and extended to the first week of follow-up.

However, little is known about how the local electrical field generated by tDCS relates to underlying neuroplastic changes and behavior. To address this question, we present a case study analysis of an individual with hemianopia due to stroke and who benefited from a combined visual rehabilitation training and tDCS treatment program. Activation associated with a visual motion perception task (obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) was used to characterize local changes in brain activity at baseline and after training. Individualized, high-resolution electrical field modeling reproducing precise cerebral and lesioned tissue geometry, predicted distortions of current flow in peri-lesional areas and diffuse clusters of peak electric fields. Using changes in fMRI signal as an index of cortical recovery, correlations to the electrical field map were determined. Significant correlations between the electrical field and change in fMRI signal were region specific including cortical areas under the anode electrode and peri-lesional visual areas. These patterns were consistent with effective tDCS facilitated rehabilitation. We describe the methodology used to analyze tDCS mechanisms through combined fMRI and computational modeling with the ultimate goal of developing a rationale for individualized therapy.", "pages": "2065-7"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Behavioural facilitation following brain stimulation: implications for neurorehabilitation.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "7263138", "authors": ["Vallar, G", "Bolognini, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation", "abstract": "Brain plasticity associated with anomia recovery in aphasia is poorly understood. Here, I review four recent studies from my lab that focused on brain modulation associated with long-term anomia outcome, its behavioral treatment, and the use of transcranial brain stimulation to enhance anomia treatment success in individuals with chronic aphasia caused by left hemisphere stroke. In a study that included 15 participants with aphasia who were compared to a group of 10 normal control subjects, we found that improved naming ability was associated with increased left hemisphere activity. A separate study (N = 26) revealed similar results in that improved anomia treatment outcome was associated with increased left hemisphere recruitment. Taken together, these two studies suggest that improved naming in chronic aphasia relies on the damaged left hemisphere. Based on these findings, we conducted two studies to appreciate the effect of using low current transcranial electrical stimulation as an adjuvant to behavioral anomia treatment. Both studies yielded positive findings in that anomia treatment outcome was improved when it was coupled with real brain stimulation as compared with a placebo (sham) condition. Overall, these four studies support the notion that the intact cortex in the lesioned left hemisphere supports anomia recovery in aphasia.", "pages": "2065-7"}, {"volume": "498", "title": "Increased short latency afferent inhibition after anodal transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9734406", "authors": ["Scelzo, E", "Giannicola, G", "Rosa, M", "Ciocca, M", "Ardolino, G", "Cogiamanian, F", "Ferrucci, R", "Fumagalli, M", "Mameli, F", "Barbieri, S", "Priori, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Readers will (a) be able to appreciate the possible influence of animal research upon the understanding of brain plasticity induced by aphasia treatment, (b) understand where functional changes associated with anomia treatment occur in the brain, (c) understand the basic principles of transcranial direct current stimulation, and (d) understand how brain stimulation coupled with aphasia treatment may potentially improve treatment outcome.", "pages": "2065-7"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Basic knowledge of transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10220223", "authors": ["Auvichayapat, P", "Auvichayapat, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet", "abstract": "Testing new therapeutic methods requires the confirmation so their efficacy, application and their safety.
