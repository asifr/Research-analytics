Repeated drug administration induces neuroadaptations associated with abnormal dopaminergic activity in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, resulting in altered cortical neurotransmission and excitability. Electrical stimulation of specific brain regions can be used in animal models and humans to induce local activation or disruption of specific circuitries or alter neuronal excitability and cause neuroadaptations. Non-surgical stimulation of specific brain regions in human addicts can be achieved by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is used for transient stimulation or disruption of neural activity in specific cortical regions, which can be used to assess cortical excitability, and to induce changes in cortical excitability. Moreover, it is suggested that repeated stimulation can cause long-lasting neuroadaptations. Therefore, TMS paradigms were used in some studies to assess the presence of altered cortical excitability associated with chronic drug consumption, while other studies have begun to assess the therapeutic potential of repetitive TMS. Similarly, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used to modulate neuronal resting membrane potential in humans and alter cortical excitability. The current review describes how these brain stimulation techniques have recently been used for the study and treatment of addiction in animal models and humans.", "pages": "559-74"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Intraoperative neurophysiologic spinal cord monitoring in thoracolumbar burst fractures.", "issue": "24", "pmid": "19910769", "authors": ["Castellon, AT", "Meves, R", "Avanzi, O"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Spine", "abstract": "Clinical prospective cohort study in academic tertiary setting.", "pages": "559-74"}, {"volume": "208", "title": "Naming facilitation induced by transcranial direct current stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "19883697", "authors": ["Fertonani, A", "Rosini, S", "Cotelli, M", "Rossini, PM", "Miniussi, C"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "Evaluate intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring of the spinal cord in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.", "pages": "559-74"}, {"volume": "1308", "title": "Motor area localization using fMRI-constrained cortical current density reconstruction of movement-related cortical potentials, a comparison with fMRI and TMS mapping.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19853590", "authors": ["Inuggi, A", "Filippi, M", "Chieffo, R", "Agosta, F", "Rocca, MA", "Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa, JJ", "Cursi, M", "Comi, G", "Leocani, L"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The majority of clinical studies using intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring in spinal trauma focus exclusively on somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP), and there are no specific article on the use of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (TcMEP), and stimulated electromyography (SEMG) by direct stimulation of the pedicular screws in thoracolumbar burst type fractures.

Gastrointestinal and liver physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to generate a long-term increase or decrease in the neuronal excitability that can modulate cognitive tasks, similar to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of tDCS on a language task in young healthy subjects. Anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS were applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) before two picture naming experiments, a preliminary study (i.e., experiment 1) and a main study (i.e., experiment 2). The results show that anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC improves naming performance, speeding up verbal reaction times after the end of the stimulation, whereas cathodal stimulation had no effect. We hypothesize that the cerebral network dedicated to lexical retrieval processing is facilitated by anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC. Although the mechanisms responsible for facilitation are not yet clear, the results presented herein implicate a facilitation lasting beyond the end of the stimulation that imply cortical plasticity mechanisms. The opportunity to non-invasively interact with the functioning of these plasticity mechanisms will surely open new and promising scenarios in language studies in basic and clinical neuroscience fields.", "pages": "559-74"}, {"volume": "102", "title": "fMRI-guided TMS on cortical eye fields: the frontal but not intraparietal eye fields regulate the coupling between visuospatial attention and eye movements.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16045502", "authors": ["Van Ettinger-Veenstra, HM", "Huijbers, W", "Gutteling, TP", "Vink, M", "Kenemans, JL", "Neggers, SF"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "The localization of human hand primary motor area (M1) has been the object of several studies during the last decades. EEG source analysis, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are non-invasive methods for localizing M1 with good accuracy compared to direct electrocorticography (ECoG) results. EEG sources were reconstructed with Cortical Current Density (CCD) method, allowing to evaluate simultaneous and distributed patterns of activation and to increase accuracy by constraining on information derived from fMRI (fMRI-CCD). The aim of this study was to compare the M1 contribution of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) with TMS and fMRI results and to test the effect of constraints strength, algorithm norm and localization methods over CCD reconstruction. Seven right-handed healthy subjects underwent 64-channel EEG recording of MRCP to right thumb movement, focal TMS mapping of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle and fMRI during right hand movement. We found fMRI activations, EEG sources and TMS mapping corresponding to the anatomical landmark of the hand area in all subjects with fMRI and TMS center-of-gravity and in almost all subjects using fMRI-CCD with moderate constraint. A significant improvement was found using fMRI-CCD compared to CCD alone. This study confirms the usefulness of multimodal integration of fMRI, EEG and TMS in localizing M1 and the possibility to increase EEG spatial resolution using fMRI information.", "pages": "559-74"}, {"volume": "587", "title": "Impact of transcranial direct current stimulation on spinal network excitability in humans.", "issue": "Pt 23", "pmid": "19540793", "authors": ["Roche, N", "Lackmy, A", "Achache, V", "Bussel, B", "Katz, R"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been investigated for the treatment of many neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. Its main effect is to modulate the cortical excitability depending on the polarity of the current applied. However, understanding the mechanisms by which these modulations are induced and persist is still an open question. A possible marker indicating a change in cortical activity is the subsequent variation in regional blood flow and metabolism. These variations can be effectively monitored using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which offers a noninvasive and portable measure of regional blood oxygenation state in cortical tissue. We studied healthy volunteers at rest and evaluated the changes in cortical oxygenation related to tDCS using fNIRS. Subjects were tested after active stimulation (12 subjects) and sham stimulation (10 subjects). Electrodes were applied at two prefrontal locations; stimulation lasted 10 min and fNIRS data were then collected for 20 min. The anodal stimulation induced a significant increase in oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentration compared to sham stimulation. Additionally, the effect of active 10-min tDCS was localized in time and lasted up to 8-10 min after the end of the stimulation. The cathodal stimulation manifested instead a negligible effect. The changes induced by tDCS on HbO(2), as captured by fNIRS, agreed with the results of previous studies. Taken together, these results help clarify the mechanisms underlying the regional alterations induced by tDCS and validate the use of fNIRS as a possible noninvasive method to monitor the neuromodulation effect of tDCS.", "pages": "559-74"}]
