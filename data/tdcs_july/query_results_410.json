For this purpose, we used the finite element method to compute the distribution of the current density in a four-layered spherical head model using various electrode montages, corresponding to a range of electrode sizes and inter-electrode distances. We found that smaller electrodes required slightly less current to achieve a constant value of the current density at a reference point on the brain surface located directly under the electrode center. Under these conditions, smaller electrodes also produced a more focal current density distribution in the brain, i.e. the magnitude of the current density fell more rapidly with distance from the reference point. The combination of two electrodes with different areas produced an asymmetric current distribution that could lead to more effective and localized neural modulation under the smaller electrode than under the larger one. Focality improved rapidly with decreasing electrode size when the larger electrode sizes were considered but the improvement was less marked for the smaller electrode sizes. Also, focality was not affected significantly by inter-electrode distance unless two large electrodes were placed close together. Increasing the inter-electrode distance resulted in decreased shunting of the current through the scalp and the cerebrospinal fluid, and decreasing electrode area resulted in increased current density on the scalp under the edges of the electrode. Our calculations suggest that when working with conventional electrodes (25-35 cm(2)), one of the electrodes should be placed just 'behind' the target relative to the other electrode, for maximum current density on the target. Also electrodes with areas in the range 3.5-12 cm(2) may provide a better compromise between focality and current density in the scalp than the traditional electrodes. Finally, the use of multiple small return electrodes may be more efficient than the use of a single large return electrode.", "pages": "066017"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation--update 2011.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "1705219", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation with weak direct currents (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)) has emerged as one of the major tools to induce neuroplastic cortical excitability alterations in humans since its (re-) introduction to the arsenal of plasticity-inducing brain stimulation tools.

The relationship between these abnormalities is still poorly understood. In this study, visual evoked potentials (VEP) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were recorded simultaneously in migraineurs and healthy subjects. In order to investigate the homeostatic-like plasticity in the visual cortex, cortical excitability was modified using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Before any stimulation, migraineurs showed significantly higher glutamate/creatine ratios (Glx/Cr) than healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, excitatory (anodal) tDCS caused an increase and inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS a decrease in the Glx/Cr ratio. Subsequent photic stimulation (PS) reversed the changes in Glx/Cr ratios, which returned back to baseline, demonstrating homeostatic-like metaplasticity in the control group. In migraine patients, both anodal and cathodal tDCS decreased the Glx/Cr ratio, which did not return to baseline after PS. While healthy subjects showed an increase in VEP amplitude under anodal and a reduction under cathodal tDCS, the modifiability of VEP under tDCS was reduced in migraineurs. The results demonstrate a reduced responsiveness of the occipital cortex to interventions that change cortical excitability in migraine. Moreover, altered glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to mediate the relation between abnormal cortical information processing and excitability in migraineurs.", "pages": "066017"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Cerebellum and processing of negative facial emotions: cerebellar transcranial DC stimulation specifically enhances the emotional recognition of facial anger and sadness.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "8262533", "authors": ["Ferrucci, R", "Giannicola, G", "Rosa, M", "Fumagalli, M", "Boggio, PS", "Hallett, M", "Zago, S", "Priori, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cognition & emotion", "abstract": "Some evidence suggests that the cerebellum participates in the complex network processing emotional facial expression.

Anodal and cathodal cerebellar tDCS both significantly enhanced sensory processing in response to negative facial expressions (anodal tDCS, p=.0021; cathodal tDCS, p=.018), but left positive emotion and neutral facial expressions unchanged (p>.05). tDCS over the right prefrontal cortex left facial expressions of both negative and positive emotion unchanged.
