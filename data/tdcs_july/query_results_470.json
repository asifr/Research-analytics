The present electroencephalography study (N\u2003=\u200312) provides support for the ability of bifrontal tDCS to suppress tinnitus intensity and tinnitus-related distress by modulation of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal area and right primary auditory cortex in resting-state spontaneous brain activity.

On the anodal tDCS side, the simultaneous bilateral tDCS seems to be a slightly less robust electrode arrangement compared with the placement of electrodes in the motor cortex-contralateral orbit montage.
