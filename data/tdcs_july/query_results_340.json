To this aim, we generated a numerical model of an adult male human upper body and applied the 3D finite element method to electric current conduction analysis. In our simulations, the active electrode was placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the reference electrode was placed at six different locations: over the right temporal lobe, on the right supraorbital region, on the right deltoid, on the left deltoid, under the chin, and on the right buccinator muscle. The maximum current density and electric field intensity values in the brainstem generated by the extracephalic reference electrodes were comparable to, or even less than, those generated by the cephalic reference electrodes. These results suggest that extracephalic reference electrodes do not lead to unwanted modulation of the brainstem cardio-respiratory and autonomic centers, as indicated by recent experimental studies. The volume energy density was concentrated at the neck area by the use of deltoid reference electrodes, but was still smaller than that around the active electrode locations. In addition, the distributions of elicited cortical electric fields demonstrated that the use of extracephalic reference electrodes might allow for the robust prediction of cortical modulations with little dependence on the reference electrode locations.", "pages": "2137-50"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Impact of tDCS on performance and learning of target detection: interaction with stimulus characteristics and experimental design.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "22450198", "authors": ["Coffman, BA", "Trumbo, MC", "Flores, RA", "Garcia, CM", "van der Merwe, AJ", "Wassermann, EM", "Weisend, MP", "Clark, VP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "We have previously found that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right inferior frontal cortex (RIFC) enhances performance during learning of a difficult visual target detection task (Clark et al., 2012). In order to examine the cognitive mechanisms of tDCS that lead to enhanced performance, here we analyzed its differential effects on responses to stimuli that varied by repetition and target presence, differences related to expectancy by comparing performance in single- and double-blind task designs, and individual differences in skin stimulation and mood. Participants were trained for 1h to detect target objects hidden in a complex virtual environment, while anodal tDCS was applied over RIFC at 0.1 mA or 2.0 mA for the first 30 min. Participants were tested immediately before and after training and again 1h later. Higher tDCS current was associated with increased performance for all test stimuli, but was greatest for repeated test stimuli with the presence of hidden-targets. This finding was replicated in a second set of subjects using a double-blind task design. Accuracy for target detection discrimination sensitivity (d'; Z(hits)-Z(false alarms)) was greater for 2.0 mA current (1.77) compared with 0.1 mA (0.95), with no differences in response bias (\u03b2). Taken together, these findings indicate that the enhancement of performance with tDCS is sensitive to stimulus repetition and target presence, but not to changes in expectancy, mood, or type of blinded task design. The implications of these findings for understanding the cognitive mechanisms of tDCS are discussed.", "pages": "2137-50"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation of the affected hemisphere does not accelerate recovery of acute stroke patients.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "22448901", "authors": ["Rossi, C", "Sallustio, F", "Di Legge, S", "Stanzione, P", "Koch, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "European journal of neurology : the official journal of the European Federation of Neurological Societies", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) is a potential tool to improve motor deficits in chronic stroke patients.

However, there has been no trial to determine whether it has a therapeutic benefit in the early stage of cerebral ischemia, and there is no consensus on the optimal time window of stimulation. Here, we described the effects of anodal tDCS in early cerebral ischemia, assessing functional improvements and changes in neuronal plasticity, and identifying the optimal time window for delivering tDCS to maximize functional gains. Thirty rats were randomly assigned to three groups: sham (n=10); early tDCS (ET), receiving tDCS 1day after ischemia for 5 days (n=10), and late tDCS (LT), receiving tDCS 1 week after ischemia for 5 days (n=10). Both ET and LT groups showed improved Barnes maze performance and motor behavioral index scores. However, only the LT group exhibited improvement in beam balance test. Immunohistochemical stainings showed that the ET group reinforced notable MAP-2 expression and the LT group enhanced mainly the level of GAP-43 in both peri-lesional and contralesional cortex. These immunohistochemical results had significant correlation with behavioral and cognitive functions. However, brain MRI and (1)H MRS showed no significant differences among the three groups in ischemic volume and metabolic alteration. These results suggest that anodal tDCS has the potential to modulate neural plasticity around the ischemic penumbra and even in the contralesional area without aggravating infarction volume and metabolic alteration. The degree of functional improvement was slightly greater when tDCS was applied 1 week rather than 1 day after ischemic injury.", "pages": "2137-50"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Exploration and modulation of brain network interactions with noninvasive brain stimulation in combination with neuroimaging.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "22440856", "authors": ["Shafi, MM", "Westover, MB", "Fox, MD", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Nicotine improves cognitive functions by modulating neuroplasticity and cortical excitability in nonsmoking subjects. As shown recently, the positive effect of nicotine on cognition might at least partially be caused by a focusing effect of nicotine on neuroplasticity in these subjects. Concordant to this, smokers under nicotine withdrawal show reduced cognitive abilities, which are at least partially restituted by nicotine consumption. We aimed to explore the neurophysiological foundation of these effects by exploring nonfocal and focal plasticity-inducing protocols in human smokers under nicotine withdrawal and exposition. Focal, synapse-specific plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), while nonfocal plasticity was induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Each subject (12) received placebo and nicotine patches combined with one of the stimulation protocols to the primary motor cortex. Corticospinal excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potential amplitudes. In smokers during nicotine withdrawal, facilitatory plasticity induced by tDCS and PAS was abolished, but restituted by nicotine. In contrast, excitability-diminishing plasticity was not affected by nicotine withdrawal. Under nicotine, the inhibitory aftereffects of PAS were delayed and prolonged, while the tDCS-generated excitability reduction was abolished. Thus, absent facilitatory plasticity in smokers during nicotine withdrawal is restituted by nicotine, favoring the deficit-compensating hypothesis of nicotine consumption. These results might shed further light on the proposed mechanism of nicotine on cognition and attention, which might be connected to nicotine addiction and probability of relapse in smokers.", "pages": "2137-50"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on cortical activity: a computational modeling study.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "22434324", "authors": ["Molaee-Ardekani, B", "M\u00e1rquez-Ruiz, J", "Merlet, I", "Leal-Campanario, R", "Gruart, A", "S\u00e1nchez-Campusano, R", "Birot, G", "Ruffini, G", "Delgado-Garc\u00eda, JM", "Wendling, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Certain problems are inherently difficult for the normal human mind.

The majority of studies over the last century find that no participants can solve the nine-dot problem - a fact we confirmed. But with 10 min of right lateralising transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), more than 40% of participants did so. Specifically, whereas no participant solved this extremely difficult problem before stimulation or with sham stimulation, 14 out of 33 participants did so with cathodal stimulation of the left anterior temporal lobe together with anodal stimulation of the right anterior temporal lobe.
