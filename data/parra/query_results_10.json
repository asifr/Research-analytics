However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp. The direction of change relative to non-stimulation reversed with tDCS stimulation polarity. For tACS there was no net effect of the MRI signal. High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation. The optimization of current measurement and artifact correction techniques, including consideration of the underlying physics, remains to be addressed.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Imaging artifacts induced by electrical stimulation during conventional fMRI of the brain.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23593651", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Lafon, B", "Dechent, P", "Parra, LC", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Background: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, versatile, and safe neuromodulation technology under investigation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, adjunct to rehabilitation, and cognitive enhancement in healthy adults. Despite promising results, there is variability in responsiveness. One potential source of variability is the intensity of current delivered to the brain which is a function of both the operator controlled tDCS dose (electrode montage and total applied current) and subject specific anatomy. We are interested in both the scale of this variability across anatomical typical adults and methods to normalize inter-individual variation by customizing tDCS dose. Computational FEM simulations are a standard technique to predict brain current flow during tDCS and can be based on subject specific anatomical MRI. Objective: To investigate this variability, we modeled multiple tDCS montages across three adults (ages 34-41, one female). Results: Conventional pad stimulation led to diffuse modulation with maximum current flow between the pads across all subjects. There was high current flow directly under the pad for one subject while the location of peak induced cortical current flow was variable. The High-Definition tDCS montage led to current flow restricted to within the ring perimeter across all subjects. The current flow profile across all subjects and montages was influenced by details in cortical gyri/sulci. Conclusion: This data suggests that subject specific modeling can facilitate consistent and more efficacious tDCS.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Inter-Individual Variation during Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Normalization of Dose Using MRI-Derived Computational Models.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22753784", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Truong, D", "Minhas, P", "Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "abstract": "Empirical research in the last decade revealed that astrocytes can respond to neurotransmitters with Ca(2+) elevations and generate feedback signals to neurons which modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This discovery changed our basic understanding of brain function and provided new perspectives for how astrocytes can participate not only to information processing, but also to the genesis of brain disorders, such as epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures that can arise focally at restricted areas and propagate throughout the brain. Studies in brain slice models suggest that astrocytes contribute to epileptiform activity by increasing neuronal excitability through a Ca(2+)-dependent release of glutamate. The underlying mechanism remains, however, unclear. In this study, we implemented a parsimonious network model of neurons and astrocytes. The model consists of excitatory and inhibitory neurons described by Izhikevich's neuron dynamics. The experimentally observed Ca(2+) change in astrocytes in response to neuronal activity was modeled with linear equations. We considered that glutamate is released from astrocytes above certain intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations thus providing a non-linear positive feedback signal to neurons. Propagating seizure-like ictal discharges (IDs) were reliably evoked in our computational model by repeatedly exciting a small area of the network, which replicates experimental results in a slice model of focal ID in entorhinal cortex. We found that the threshold of focal ID generation was lowered when an excitatory feedback-loop between astrocytes and neurons was included. Simulations show that astrocytes can contribute to ID generation by directly affecting the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the neuronal network. Our model can be used to obtain mechanistic insights into the distinct contributions of the different signaling pathways to the generation and propagation of focal IDs.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Computational model of neuron-astrocyte interactions during focal seizure generation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23099102", "authors": ["Reato, D", "Cammarota, M", "Parra, LC", "Carmignoto, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in computational neuroscience", "abstract": "EEG (electroencephalography) has been used for decades in thousands of research studies and is today a routine clinical tool despite the small magnitude of measured scalp potentials. It is widely accepted that the currents originating in the brain are strongly influenced by the high resistivity of skull bone, but it is less well known that the thin layer of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) has perhaps an even more important effect on EEG scalp magnitude by spatially blurring the signals. Here it is shown that brain shift and the resulting small changes in CSF layer thickness, induced by changing the subject's position, have a significant effect on EEG signal magnitudes in several standard visual paradigms. For spatially incoherent high-frequency activity the effect produced by switching from prone to supine can be dramatic, increasing occipital signal power by several times for some subjects (on average 80%). MRI measurements showed that the occipital CSF layer between the brain and skull decreases by approximately 30% in thickness when a subject moves from prone to supine position. A multiple dipole model demonstrated that this can indeed lead to occipital EEG signal power increases in the same direction and order of magnitude as those observed here. These results suggest that future EEG studies should control for subjects' posture, and that some studies may consider placing their subjects into the most favorable position for the experiment. These findings also imply that special consideration should be given to EEG measurements from subjects with brain atrophy due to normal aging or neurodegenerative diseases, since the resulting increase in CSF layer thickness could profoundly decrease scalp potential measurements.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "64", "title": "Subject position affects EEG magnitudes.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23097644", "authors": ["Rice, JK", "Rorden, C", "Little, JS", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Rational development of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) requires solving the 'forward problem': the computation of the electric field distribution in the head resulting from the application of scalp currents. Derivation of forward models has represented a major effort in brain stimulation research, with model complexity ranging from spherical shells to individualized head models based on magnetic resonance imagery. Despite such effort, an easily accessible benchmark head model is greatly needed when individualized modeling is either undesired (to observe general population trends as opposed to individual differences) or unfeasible. Here, we derive a closed-form linear system which relates the applied current to the induced electric potential. It is shown that in the spherical harmonic (Fourier) domain, a simple scalar multiplication relates the current density on the scalp to the electric potential in the brain. Equivalently, the current density in the head follows as the spherical convolution between the scalp current distribution and the point spread function of the head, which we derive. Thus, if one knows the spherical harmonic representation of the scalp current (i.e. the electrode locations and current intensity to be employed), one can easily compute the resulting electric field at any point inside the head. Conversely, one may also readily determine the scalp current distribution required to generate an arbitrary electric field in the brain (the 'backward problem' in tCS). We demonstrate the simplicity and utility of the model with a series of characteristic curves which sweep across a variety of stimulation parameters: electrode size, depth of stimulation, head size and anode-cathode separation.

Here we utilize neural responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by multiple presentations of short film clips to index brain states marked by high levels of correlation within and across subjects. We formulate a novel signal decomposition method which extracts maximally correlated signal components from multiple EEG records. The resulting components capture correlations down to a one-second time resolution, thus revealing that peak correlations of neural activity across viewings can occur in remarkable correspondence with arousing moments of the film. Moreover, a significant reduction in neural correlation occurs upon a second viewing of the film or when the narrative is disrupted by presenting its scenes scrambled in time. We also probe oscillatory brain activity during periods of heightened correlation, and observe during such times a significant increase in the theta band for a frontal component and reductions in the alpha and beta frequency bands for parietal and occipital components. Low-resolution EEG tomography of these components suggests that the correlated neural activity is consistent with sources in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Put together, these results suggest that the observed synchrony reflects attention- and emotion-modulated cortical processing which may be decoded with high temporal resolution by extracting maximally correlated components of neural activity.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Correlated components of ongoing EEG point to emotionally laden attention - a possible marker of engagement?", "issue": "", "pmid": "20435146", "authors": ["Dmochowski, JP", "Sajda, P", "Dias, J", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Exploratory variability is essential for sensorimotor learning, but it is not known how and at what timescales it is regulated. We manipulated song learning in zebra finches to experimentally control the requirements for vocal exploration in different parts of their song. We first trained birds to perform a one-syllable song, and once they mastered it, we added a new syllable to the song model. Remarkably, when practicing the modified song, birds rapidly alternated between high and low acoustic variability to confine vocal exploration to the newly added syllable. Furthermore, even within syllables, acoustic variability changed independently across song elements that were only milliseconds apart. Analysis of the entire vocal output during learning revealed that the variability of each song element decreased as it approached the target, correlating with momentary local distance from the target and less so with the overall distance within a syllable. We conclude that vocal error is computed locally in subsyllabic timescales and that song elements can be learned and crystallized independently. Songbirds have dedicated brain circuitry for vocal babbling in the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), which generates exploratory song patterns that drive premotor neurons at the song nucleus RA. We hypothesize that either AFP adjusts the gain of vocal exploration in fine timescales or that the sensitivity of RA premotor neurons to AFP/HVC inputs varies across song elements.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Vocal exploration is locally regulated during song learning.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "21620985", "authors": ["Ravbar, P", "Lipkind, D", "Parra, LC", "Tchernichovski, O"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides a non-invasive tool to elicit neuromodulation by delivering current through electrodes placed on the scalp. The present clinical paradigm uses two relatively large electrodes to inject current through the head resulting in electric fields that are broadly distributed over large regions of the brain. In this paper, we present a method that uses multiple small electrodes (i.e. 1.2 cm diameter) and systematically optimize the applied currents to achieve effective and targeted stimulation while ensuring safety of stimulation. We found a fundamental trade-off between achievable intensity (at the target) and focality, and algorithms to optimize both measures are presented. When compared with large pad-electrodes (approximated here by a set of small electrodes covering 25 cm(2)), the proposed approach achieves electric fields which exhibit simultaneously greater focality (80% improvement) and higher target intensity (98% improvement) at cortical targets using the same total current applied. These improvements illustrate the previously unrecognized and non-trivial dependence of the optimal electrode configuration on the desired electric field orientation and the maximum total current (due to safety). Similarly, by exploiting idiosyncratic details of brain anatomy, the optimization approach significantly improves upon prior un-optimized approaches using small electrodes. The analysis also reveals the optimal use of conventional bipolar montages: maximally intense tangential fields are attained with the two electrodes placed at a considerable distance from the target along the direction of the desired field; when radial fields are desired, the maximum-intensity configuration consists of an electrode placed directly over the target with a distant return electrode. To summarize, if a target location and stimulation orientation can be defined by the clinician, then the proposed technique is superior in terms of both focality and intensity as compared to previous solutions and is thus expected to translate into improved patient safety and increased clinical efficacy.", "pages": "405"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Optimized multi-electrode stimulation increases focality and intensity at target.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "21715612", "authors": ["Dmochowski, JP", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Su, Y", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "The presence of tinnitus often coincides with hearing loss. It has been argued that reduced peripheral input leads to frequency-specific increase in neuronal gains resulting in tinnitus-related hyper-activity. Following this gain-adaptation hypothesis, impaired cochlear function should be predictive of the presence and spectral characteristics of tinnitus. To assess cochlear function, perceptual thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured with high frequency resolution for subjects with tinnitus and non-tinnitus control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a029 and N\u00a0=\u00a018) with and without hearing loss. Subjects with tinnitus also provided a 'tinnitus likeness spectrum' by rating the similarity of their tinnitus to tones at various frequencies. On average, subjects with tinnitus had elevated thresholds, reduced DPOAE, and increased slope of the DPOAE input-output function in the range from 4 to 10\u00a0kHz. These measures were strongly correlated and were equally predictive of the presence of tinnitus. Subjects with a pronounced edge to their hearing loss profile were very likely to have tinnitus. In the group average, the tinnitus likeness spectrum was correlated with perceptual thresholds (r\u00a0=\u00a00.98, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), confirming previous reports. For 19 of 29 of subjects, perceptual thresholds were correlated with the tinnitus likeness ratings across frequencies and this correlation was significantly improved when low input-level DPOAE were included as an additional variable (r\u00a0=\u00a00.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09, N\u00a0=\u00a019).
