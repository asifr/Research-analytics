In the case of tinnitus, the gain adaptation enhances internal noise of a frequency band otherwise silent due to damage. This generates a percept of a phantom sound as a consequence of hearing loss. In the case of Zwicker tone, a frequency band is temporarily silent during the presentation of a notched broadband sound, resulting in a percept of a tone at the notched frequency. The model suggests a link between tinnitus and the Zwicker tone percept, in that it predicts different results for normal and tinnitus subjects due to a loss of instantaneous nonlinear compression. Listening experiments on 44 subjects show that tinnitus subjects (11 of 44) are significantly more likely to hear the Zwicker tone. This psychoacoustic experiment establishes the first empirical link between the Zwicker tone percept and tinnitus. Together with the modeling results, this supports the hypothesis that the phantom percept is a consequence of a central adaptation mechanism confronted with a degraded sensory apparatus.", "pages": "1632-41"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Spike timing amplifies the effect of electric fields on neurons: implications for endogenous field effects.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "17360926", "authors": ["Radman, T", "Su, Y", "An, JH", "Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Despite compelling phenomenological evidence that small electric fields (<5 mV/mm) can affect brain function, a quantitative and experimentally verified theory is currently lacking. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which the nonlinear properties of single neurons \"amplify\" the effect of small electric fields: when concurrent to suprathreshold synaptic input, small electric fields can have significant effects on spike timing. For low-frequency fields, our theory predicts a linear dependency of spike timing changes on field strength. For high-frequency fields (relative to the synaptic input), the theory predicts coherent firing, with mean firing phase and coherence each increasing monotonically with field strength. Importantly, in both cases, the effects of fields on spike timing are amplified with decreasing synaptic input slope and increased cell susceptibility (millivolt membrane polarization per field amplitude). We confirmed these predictions experimentally using CA1 hippocampal neurons in vitro exposed to static (direct current) and oscillating (alternating current) uniform electric fields. In addition, we develop a robust method to quantify cell susceptibility using spike timing. Our results provide a precise mechanism for a functional role of endogenous field oscillations (e.g., gamma) in brain function and introduce a framework for considering the effects of environmental fields and design of low-intensity therapeutic neurostimulation technologies.", "pages": "1632-41"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Model of the effect of extracellular fields on spike time coherence.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17271327", "authors": ["Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Accurately timed spiking has been recorded in-vivo in the visual and auditory cortex, many layers removed from the primary sensory neurons. This temporal accuracy may be maintained despite noisy synaptic transmission by the simultaneous firing of multiple neurons. Here we show in simulations that a coherent polarization of a population of neurons through extracellular fields can further increase the coherence of the population's firing times.

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10% of the sequence).

An important class of such models have variables whose dependency graph is a tree. If the hidden variables take values on a finite set, most computations with the model can be performed exactly, including the likelihood calculation, training with the EM algorithm, etc. Crouse et al. developed one such model, the hidden Markov tree (HMT). They took particular care to limit the complexity of their model. We argue that it is beneficial to allow more complex tree-structured models, describe the use of information theoretic penalties to choose the model complexity, and present experimental results to support these proposals. For these experiments, we use what we call the hierarchical image probability (HIP) model. The differences between the HIP and the HMT models include the use of multivariate Gaussians to model the distributions of local vectors of wavelet coefficients and the use of different numbers of hidden states at each resolution. We demonstrate the broad utility of image distributions by applying the HIP model to classification, synthesis, and compression, across a variety of image types, namely, electrooptical, synthetic aperture radar, and mammograms (digitized X-rays).

We extract spatial components that maximally discriminate between target and distractor stimulus conditions over specific time windows between stimulus onset and the time of a motor response. We then compute the peak latency of this differential activity on a trial-by-trial basis, and correlate this with response time. We find, for our nine participants, that the majority of the latency is introduced by component activity which begins far-frontally 200 ms prior to the response and proceeds to become parietally distributed near the time of response. This activity is consistent with the hypothesis that cortical networks involved in generating the late positive complexes may be the origins of the observed response time variability in rapid discrimination of visual objects.", "pages": "1632-41"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Recipes for the linear analysis of EEG.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16084117", "authors": ["Parra, LC", "Spence, CD", "Gerson, AD", "Sajda, P"], "year": "2005", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a simple set of \"recipes\" for the analysis of high spatial density EEG.

It is based on the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, extending it to include a constraint on the positivity of the amplitudes of the recovered spectra. This constraint enables recovery of physically meaningful spectra even in the presence of noise that causes a significant number of the observation amplitudes to be negative. We demonstrate and characterize the algorithm's performance using 31P volumetric brain data, comparing the results with two different blind source separation methods: Bayesian spectral decomposition (BSD) and nonnegative sparse coding (NNSC). We then incorporate the cNMF algorithm into a hierarchical decomposition framework, showing that it can be used to recover tissue-specific spectra given a processing hierarchy that proceeds coarse-to-fine.
