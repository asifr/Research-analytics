A vast buffer of information is transiently available to be broadcasted which, if not retrieved in time, fades rapidly without reaching consciousness. An interesting feature of this experiment is that objective performance and subjective confidence is decoupled. This converts this paradigm in an ideal vehicle to understand the brain dynamics of the construction of confidence. Here we report a high-density EEG experiment in which we infer elements of the EEG response which are indicative of subjective confidence. We find that an early response during encoding partially correlates with perceived confidence. However, the bulk of the weight of subjective confidence is determined during a late, N400-like waveform, during the retrieval stage. This shows that we can find markers of access to internal, subjective states, that are uncoupled from objective response and stimulus properties of the task, and we propose that this can be used with decoding methods of EEG to infer subjective mental states.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Low-intensity electrical stimulation affects network dynamics by modulating population rate and spike timing.", "issue": "45", "pmid": "21068312", "authors": ["Reato, D", "Rahman, A", "Bikson, M", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Clinical effects of transcranial electrical stimulation with weak currents are remarkable considering the low amplitude of the electric fields acting on the brain. Elucidating the processes by which small currents affect ongoing brain activity is of paramount importance for the rational design of noninvasive electrotherapeutic strategies and to determine the relevance of endogenous fields. We propose that in active neuronal networks, weak electrical fields induce small but coherent changes in the firing rate and timing of neuronal populations that can be magnified by dynamic network activity. Specifically, we show that carbachol-induced gamma oscillations (25-35 Hz) in rat hippocampal slices have an inherent rate-limiting dynamic and timing precision that govern susceptibility to low-frequency weak electric fields (<50 Hz; <10 V/m). This leads to a range of nonlinear responses, including the following: (1) asymmetric power modulation by DC fields resulting from balanced excitation and inhibition; (2) symmetric power modulation by lower frequency AC fields with a net-zero change in firing rate; and (3) half-harmonic oscillations for higher frequency AC fields resulting from increased spike timing precision. These underlying mechanisms were elucidated by slice experiments and a parsimonious computational network model of single-compartment spiking neurons responding to electric field stimulation with small incremental polarization. Intracellular recordings confirmed model predictions on neuronal timing and rate changes, as well as spike phase-entrainment resonance at 0.2 V/m. Finally, our data and mechanistic framework provide a functional role for endogenous electric fields, specifically illustrating that modulation of gamma oscillations during theta-modulated gamma activity can result from field effects alone.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "127", "title": "Sensitization to masked tones following notched-noise correlates with estimates of cochlear function using distortion product otoacoustic emissions.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11769308", "authors": ["Zhou, X", "Henin, S", "Thompson, SE", "Long, GR", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "abstract": "Neuronal gain adaptation has been proposed as the underlying mechanism leading to the perception of phantom sounds such as Zwicker tones and tinnitus. In this gain-adaptation theory, cochlear compression plays a significant role with weaker compression leading to stronger phantom percepts. The specific aim of this study was to find a link between the strength of neuronal gain adaptation and cochlear compression. Compression was assessed using distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Gain adaptation is hypothesized to manifest itself in the sensitization observed for the detection of masked tones when preceded by notched noise. Perceptual thresholds for pure tones in notched noise were measured at multiple frequencies following various priming signals. The observed sensitization was larger than expected from the combined effect of the various maskers. However, there was no link between sensitization and compression. Instead, across subjects, stronger sensitization correlated with stronger DPOAEs evoked by low-level primaries. In addition, growth of DPOAEs correlated reliably with perceptual thresholds across frequencies within subjects. Together, the data suggest that short-term dynamic adaptation leading to perceptual sensitization is the result of an active process mediated by the outer hair cells, which are thought to modulate the gain of the cochlear amplifier via efferent feedback.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "The development of stimulus-specific auditory responses requires song exposure in male but not female zebra finches.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11160438", "authors": ["Maul, KK", "Voss, HU", "Parra, LC", "Salgado-Commissariat, D", "Ballon, D", "Tchernichovski, O", "Helekar, SA"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Developmental neurobiology", "abstract": "Juvenile male zebra finches develop their song by imitation. Females do not sing but are attracted to males' songs. With functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related potentials we tested how early auditory experience shapes responses in the auditory forebrain of the adult bird. Adult male birds kept in isolation over the sensitive period for song learning showed no consistency in auditory responses to conspecific songs, calls, and syllables. Thirty seconds of song playback each day over development, which is sufficient to induce song imitation, was also sufficient to shape stimulus-specific responses. Strikingly, adult females kept in isolation over development showed responses similar to those of males that were exposed to songs. We suggest that early auditory experience with songs may be required to tune perception toward conspecific songs in males, whereas in females song selectivity develops even without prior exposure to song.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "On the maximization of information flow between spiking neurons.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "11856534", "authors": ["Parra, LC", "Beck, JM", "Bell, AJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neural computation", "abstract": "A feedforward spiking network represents a nonlinear transformation that maps a set of input spikes to a set of output spikes.

From a general doctrine of combining information from different sensory modalities (the principle of inverse effectiveness), one would expect that the visual signals would be most effective at the highest levels of auditory noise. In contrast, we find, in accord with a recent paper, that visual information improves performance more at intermediate levels of auditory noise than at the highest levels, and we show that a novel visual stimulus containing only temporal information does the same. We present a Bayesian model of optimal cue integration that can explain these conflicts. In this model, words are regarded as points in a multidimensional space and word recognition is a probabilistic inference process. When the dimensionality of the feature space is low, the Bayesian model predicts inverse effectiveness; when the dimensionality is high, the enhancement is maximal at intermediate auditory noise levels. When the auditory and visual stimuli differ slightly in high noise, the model makes a counterintuitive prediction: as sound quality increases, the proportion of reported words corresponding to the visual stimulus should first increase and then decrease. We confirm this prediction in a behavioral experiment. We conclude that auditory-visual speech perception obeys the same notion of optimality previously observed only for simple multisensory stimuli.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Single-trial analysis of neuroimaging data: inferring neural networks underlying perceptual decision-making in the human brain.", "issue": "", "pmid": "12917358", "authors": ["Sajda, P", "Philiastides, MG", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering", "abstract": "Advances in neural signal and image acquisition as well as in multivariate signal processing and machine learning are enabling a richer and more rigorous understanding of the neural basis of human decision-making. Decision-making is essentially characterized behaviorally by the variability of the decision across individual trials--e.g., error and response time distributions. To infer the neural processes that govern decision-making requires identifying neural correlates of such trial-to-trial behavioral variability. In this paper, we review efforts that utilize signal processing and machine learning to enable single-trial analysis of neural signals acquired while subjects perform simple decision-making tasks. Our focus is on neuroimaging data collected noninvasively via electroencephalograpy (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We review the specific framework for extracting decision-relevant neural components from the neuroimaging data, the goal being to analyze the trial-to-trial variability of the neural signal along these component directions and to relate them to elements of the decision-making process. We review results for perceptual decision-making and discrimination tasks, including paradigms in which EEG variability is used to inform an fMRI analysis. We discuss how single-trial analysis reveals aspects of the underlying decision-making networks that are unobservable using traditional trial-averaging methods.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Spectrum separation resolves partial-volume effect of MRSI as demonstrated on brain tumor scans.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "14978199", "authors": ["Su, Y", "Thakur, SB", "Karimi, S", "Du, S", "Sajda, P", "Huang, W", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2008", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is currently used clinically in conjunction with anatomical MRI to assess the presence and extent of brain tumors and to evaluate treatment response. Unfortunately, the clinical utility of MRSI is limited by significant variability of in vivo spectra. Spectral profiles show increased variability because of partial coverage of large voxel volumes, infiltration of normal brain tissue by tumors, innate tumor heterogeneity, and measurement noise. We address these problems directly by quantifying the abundance (i.e. volume fraction) within a voxel for each tissue type instead of the conventional estimation of metabolite concentrations from spectral resonance peaks. This 'spectrum separation' method uses the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, which simultaneously decomposes the observed spectra of multiple voxels into abundance distributions and constituent spectra. The accuracy of the estimated abundances is validated on phantom data. The presented results on 20 clinical cases of brain tumor show reduced cross-subject variability. This is reflected in improved discrimination between high-grade and low-grade gliomas, which demonstrates the physiological relevance of the extracted spectra. These results show that the proposed spectral analysis method can improve the effectiveness of MRSI as a diagnostic tool.", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "49", "title": "Effects of high-frequency stimulation on epileptiform activity in vitro: ON/OFF control paradigm.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "15483131", "authors": ["Su, Y", "Radman, T", "Vaynshteyn, J", "Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Epilepsia", "abstract": "To determine the effects of high-frequency electrical stimulation on electrographic seizure activity during and after stimulation (ON-effect and OFF-effect).", "pages": "2818-21"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Smooth bilinear classification of EEG.", "issue": "", "pmid": "5684882", "authors": ["Dyrholm, M", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...
