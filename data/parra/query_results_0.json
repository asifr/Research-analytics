These rhythms originate from a variety of different network mechanisms, which give rise to a wide-ranging spectrum of oscillation frequencies. In the last few years an increasing number of clinical research studies have explored transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with weak current as a tool for affecting brain function. The premise of these interventions is that tACS will interact with ongoing brain oscillations. However, the exact mechanisms by which weak currents could affect neuronal oscillations at different frequency bands are not well known and this, in turn, limits the rational optimization of human experiments. Here we review the available in vitro and in vivo animal studies that attempt to provide mechanistic explanations. The findings can be summarized into a few generic principles, such as periodic modulation of excitability, shifts in spike timing, modulation of firing rate, and shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. These effects result from weak but simultaneous polarization of a large number of neurons. Whether this can lead to an entrainment or a modulation of brain oscillations, or whether AC currents have no effect at all, depends entirely on the specific dynamic that gives rise to the different brain rhythms, as discussed here for slow wave oscillations (\u223c1 Hz) and gamma oscillations (\u223c30 Hz). We conclude with suggestions for further experiments to investigate the role of AC stimulation for other physiologically relevant brain rhythms.", "pages": "687"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Automated MRI segmentation for individualized modeling of current flow in the human head.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "24099977", "authors": ["Huang, Y", "Dmochowski, JP", "Su, Y", "Datta, A", "Rorden, C", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "Objective. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and high-density electroencephalography require accurate models of current flow for precise targeting and current source reconstruction. At a minimum, such modeling must capture the idiosyncratic anatomy of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and skull for each individual subject. Currently, the process to build such high-resolution individualized models from structural magnetic resonance images requires labor-intensive manual segmentation, even when utilizing available automated segmentation tools. Also, accurate placement of many high-density electrodes on an individual scalp is a tedious procedure. The goal was to develop fully automated techniques to reduce the manual effort in such a modeling process. Approach. A fully automated segmentation technique based on Statical Parametric Mapping 8, including an improved tissue probability map and an automated correction routine for segmentation errors, was developed, along with an automated electrode placement tool for high-density arrays. The performance of these automated routines was evaluated against results from manual segmentation on four healthy subjects and seven stroke patients. The criteria include segmentation accuracy, the difference of current flow distributions in resulting HD-tDCS models and the optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets.Main results. The segmentation tool can segment out not just the brain but also provide accurate results for CSF, skull and other soft tissues with a field of view extending to the neck. Compared to manual results, automated segmentation deviates by only 7% and 18% for normal and stroke subjects, respectively. The predicted electric fields in the brain deviate by 12% and 29% respectively, which is well within the variability observed for various modeling choices. Finally, optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets do not differ significantly.Significance. Fully automated individualized modeling may now be feasible for large-sample EEG research studies and tDCS clinical trials.", "pages": "687"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Validation of finite element model of transcranial electrical stimulation using scalp potentials: implications for clinical dose.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "23649036", "authors": ["Datta, A", "Zhou, X", "Su, Y", "Parra, LC", "Bikson, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "During transcranial electrical stimulation, current passage across the scalp generates voltage across the scalp surface.

However, how this distribution arises has not been conclusively demonstrated in direct analyses of people's actions in social networks. Here, we perform a causal inference analysis and find an underlying cause for this phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that heavy-tailed degree distribution is causally determined by similarly skewed distribution of human activity. Specifically, the degree of an individual is entirely random - following a \"maximum entropy attachment\" model - except for its mean value which depends deterministically on the volume of the users' activity. This relation cannot be explained by interactive models, like preferential attachment, since the observed actions are not likely to be caused by interactions with other people.", "pages": "687"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "On the role of electric field orientation in optimal design of transcranial current stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17395721", "authors": ["Dmochowski, JP", "Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Richardson, J", "Fridriksson, J", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Although increased/decreased excitability under the anode/cathode electrode is nominally associated with membrane depolarization/hyperpolarization, which cellular compartments (somas, dendrites, axons and their terminals) mediate changes in cortical excitability remains unaddressed. Here we consider the acute effects of DCS on excitatory synaptic efficacy. Using multi-scale computational models and rat cortical brain slices, we show the following. (1) Typical tDCS montages produce predominantly tangential (relative to the cortical surface) direction currents (4-12 times radial direction currents), even directly under electrodes. (2) Radial current flow (parallel to the somatodendritic axis) modulates synaptic efficacy consistent with somatic polarization, with depolarization facilitating synaptic efficacy. (3) Tangential current flow (perpendicular to the somatodendritic axis) modulates synaptic efficacy acutely (during stimulation) in an afferent pathway-specific manner that is consistent with terminal polarization, with hyperpolarization facilitating synaptic efficacy. (4) Maximal polarization during uniform DCS is expected at distal (the branch length is more than three times the membrane length constant) synaptic terminals, independent of and two-three times more susceptible than pyramidal neuron somas. We conclude that during acute DCS the cellular targets responsible for modulation of synaptic efficacy are concurrently somata and axon terminals, with the direction of cortical current flow determining the relative influence.", "pages": "687"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "An automated method for high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation modeling.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22972194", "authors": ["Huang, Y", "Su, Y", "Rorden, C", "Dmochowski, J", "Datta, A", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The conventional \"dosage\", consisting of a large (25 cm(2)) anode over the target with the cathode over the contralateral hemisphere, has been previously shown to yield broadly distributed electric fields whose intensities at the target region are less than maximal. Here, we report the results of a systematic targeting procedure with small \"high-definition\" electrodes that was used in preparation for a pilot study on 8 stroke patients with chronic aphasia. We employ functional and anatomical magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI/MRI) to define a target and optimize (with respect to the electric field magnitude at the target) the electrode configuration, respectively, and demonstrate that electric field strengths in targeted cortex can be substantially increased (63%) over the conventional approach. The optimal montage exhibits significant variation across subjects as well as when perturbing the target location within a subject. However, for each displacement of the target co-ordinates, the algorithm is able to determine a montage which delivers a consistent amount of current to that location. These results demonstrate that MRI-based models of current flow yield maximal stimulation of target structures, and as such, may aid in reliably assessing the efficacy of tDCS in neuro-rehabilitation.", "pages": "687"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "A pilot study on effects of 4\u00d71 high-definition tDCS on motor cortex excitability.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19617555", "authors": ["Caparelli-Daquer, EM", "Zimmermann, TJ", "Mooshagian, E", "Parra, LC", "Rice, JK", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

This decay is thought to result from homeostatic synaptic downscaling. Transcranial electrical stimulation can entrain slow-wave oscillations (SWO) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG). A computational model of the underlying mechanism predicts that firing rates are predominantly increased during stimulation. Assuming that synaptic homeostasis is driven by average firing rates, we expected an acceleration of synaptic downscaling during stimulation, which is compensated by a reduced drive after stimulation. We show that 25 minutes of transcranial electrical stimulation, as predicted, reduced the decay of SWO in the remainder of the night. Anatomically accurate simulations of the field intensities on human cortex precisely matched the effect size in different EEG electrodes. Together these results suggest a mechanistic link between electrical stimulation and accelerated synaptic homeostasis in human sleep.", "pages": "687"}]
