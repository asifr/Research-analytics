This need prompted the present follow-up study, which assesses post-acute effects of tDCS (no maintenance stimulation was performed), in the mid-term, in a sample of major depressives. Methods After completing an acute, open trial of tDCS, 23 outpatients with either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder entered a naturalistic follow-up (T1) with clinical evaluations at one week (T2), 1 month (T3), and 3 months (T4). A quantitative analysis of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores, through repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (T1-T4) and paired t-test for comparing specific time points (T1-T2, T2-T3, and T3-T4), was performed.

Recent studies revealed time-dependent consolidation as a common feature of visuomotor tasks. We have previously shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with repeated motor training benefits consolidation by the induction of offline skill gains in a complex visuomotor task, preventing the regular occurrence of skill loss between days. Here, we asked 2 questions: What is the time course of consolidation between days for this task and do exogenously induced offline gains develop as a function of time or overnight sleep? We found that both the development of offline skill loss in sham-stimulated subjects and offline skill gains induced by anodal tDCS critically depend on the passage of time after training, but not on overnight sleep. These findings support the view that tDCS interacts directly with the physiological consolidation process. However, in a control experiment, anodal tDCS applied after the training did not induce skill gains, implying that coapplication of tDCS and training is required to induce offline skill gains, pointing to the initiation of consolidation already during training.", "pages": "e43-4"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS with two active electrodes of the same polarity modulates bilateral cognitive processes differentially.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "23951202", "authors": ["Klein, E", "Mann, A", "Huber, S", "Bloechle, J", "Willmes, K", "Karim, AA", "Nuerk, HC", "Moeller, K"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) encompasses all methods of non-invasive current application to the brain used in research and clinical practice. We present the first comprehensive and technical review, explaining the evolution of tES in both terminology and dosage over the past 100 years of research to present day. Current transcranial Pulsed Current Stimulation (tPCS) approaches such as Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) descended from Electrosleep (ES) through Cranial Electro-stimulation Therapy (CET), Transcerebral Electrotherapy (TCET), and NeuroElectric Therapy (NET) while others like Transcutaneous Cranial Electrical Stimulation (TCES) descended from Electroanesthesia (EA) through Limoge, and Interferential Stimulation. Prior to a contemporary resurgence in interest, variations of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation were explored intermittently, including Polarizing current, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), and Transcranial Micropolarization. The development of these approaches alongside Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and pharmacological developments are considered. Both the roots and unique features of contemporary approaches such as transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) and transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) are discussed. Trends and incremental developments in electrode montage and waveform spanning decades are presented leading to the present day. Commercial devices, seminal conferences, and regulatory decisions are noted. We conclude with six rules on how increasing medical and technological sophistication may now be leveraged for broader success and adoption of tES.", "pages": "e43-4"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Brain stimulation paired with novel locomotor training with robotic gait orthosis in chronic stroke: a feasibility study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9444471", "authors": ["Danzl, MM", "Chelette, KC", "Lee, K", "Lykins, D", "Sawaki, L"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroRehabilitation", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an innovative method to explore the causal structure-function relationship of brain areas. We investigated the specificity of bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS with two active electrodes of the same polarity (e.g., cathodal on both hemispheres) applied to intraparietal cortices bilaterally using a combined between- and within-task approach. Regarding between-task specificity, we observed that bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS affected a numerical (mental addition) but not a control task (colour word Stroop), indicating a specific influence of tDCS on numerical but not on domain general cognitive processes associated with the bilateral IPS. In particular, the numerical effect of distractor distance was more pronounced under cathodal than under anodal stimulation. Moreover, with respect to within-task specificity we only found the numerical distractor distance effect in mental addition to be modulated by direct current stimulation, whereas the effect of target identity was not affected. This implies a differential influence of bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS on the recruitment of different processing components within the same task (number magnitude processing vs. recognition of familiarity). In sum, this first successful application of bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS with two active electrodes of the same polarity in numerical cognition research corroborates the specific proposition of the Triple Code Model that number magnitude information is represented bilaterally in the intraparietal cortices.", "pages": "e43-4"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and robotic practice in chronic stroke: the dimension of timing.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "10349031", "authors": ["Giacobbe, V", "Krebs, HI", "Volpe, BT", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Rykman, A", "Zeiarati, G", "Fregni, F", "Dipietro, L", "Thickbroom, GW", "Edwards, DJ"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroRehabilitation", "abstract": "1) To investigate the feasibility of combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the lower extremity (LE) motor cortex with novel locomotor training to facilitate gait in subjects with chronic stroke and low ambulatory status, and 2) to obtain insight from study subjects and their caregivers to inform future trial design.", "pages": "e43-4"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Non-invasive Cerebellar Stimulation-a Consensus Paper.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15601514", "authors": ["Grimaldi, G", "Argyropoulos, GP", "Boehringer, A", "Celnik, P", "Edwards, MJ", "Ferrucci, R", "Galea, JM", "Groiss, SJ", "Hiraoka, K", "Kassavetis, P", "Lesage, E", "Manto, M", "Miall, RC", "Priori, A", "Sadnicka, A", "Ugawa, Y", "Ziemann, U"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "abstract": "Double-blind, randomized controlled study with additional qualitative exploratory descriptive design.
