We aimed to evaluate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could be effective in modulating the emotional aspects of pain as to further explore mechanisms of tDCS in pain relief. Twenty-three healthy subjects rated images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain (baseline), and then received stimulation with tDCS under four different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), occipital cortex (V1); and sham tDCS. The order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. During each stimulation session (after 3 min of stimulation), subjects were shown a new set of aversive images and were again asked to rate the images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain. The results showed that ratings of unpleasantness and discomfort/pain were significantly decreased during DLPFC tDCS only, as compared to baseline and sham tDCS. The other conditions of stimulation (M1 and V1 tDCS) did not result in any significant changes. These results support the notion that DLPFC is a critical area for the emotional processing of pain and also suggests that DLPFC may be a potential target of stimulation for alleviation of pain with a significant emotional-affective component. Our results also suggest that the mechanism of tDCS in modulating emotional pain involve pathways that are independent of those modulating the somatosensory perception of pain.", "pages": "212-7"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Modulatory effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on perception and pain thresholds in healthy volunteers.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "18717717", "authors": ["Boggio, PS", "Zaghi, S", "Lopes, M", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2008", "journal": "European journal of neurology : the official journal of the European Federation of Neurological Societies", "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is effective in modulating sensory and pain perception thresholds in healthy subjects as to further explore mechanisms of tDCS in pain relief.", "pages": "212-7"}, {"volume": "75", "title": "Neurostimulatory therapeutics in management of treatment-resistant depression with focus on deep brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "18704979", "authors": ["Dumitriu, D", "Collins, K", "Alterman, R", "Mathew, SJ"], "year": "", "journal": "The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York", "abstract": "Twenty healthy subjects received stimulation with tDCS under four different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), occipital cortex (V1), and sham tDCS.

An improved understanding of the complex circuitry underlying depressive disorders has fostered an explosion in the development of new, nonpharmacological approaches. Each of these treatments seeks to restore normal brain activity via electrical or magnetic stimulation. In this article, the authors discuss the ongoing evolution of neurostimulatory treatments for treatment-resistant depression, reviewing the methods, efficacy, and current research on electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, focal electrically administered stimulated seizure therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, chronic epidural cortical stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation. Special attention is given to deep brain stimulation, the most focally targeted approach. The history, purported mechanisms of action, and current research are outlined in detail. Although deep brain stimulation is the most invasive of the neurostimulatory treatments developed to date, it may hold significant promise in alleviating symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients with the most severe and disabling mood disorders.", "pages": "212-7"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation: State of the art 2008.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "5457503", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Cohen, LG", "Wassermann, EM", "Priori, A", "Lang, N", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W", "Hummel, F", "Boggio, PS", "Fregni, F", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Driving a car is a complex task requiring coordinated functioning of distributed brain regions.
