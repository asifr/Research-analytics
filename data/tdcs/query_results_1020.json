Because transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is capable of inducing lasting changes of cortical excitability, we investigated the after-effects of tDCS on the propagation velocity of CSD in the rat. Twenty-five anesthetised rats received either anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS. The stimulation was applied for 20 min at a current strength of 200 microA after the recording of three baseline CSD measurements. Starting 5 min after tDCS, a further three CSDs were elicited and CSD velocity recorded at intervals of 20 min. tDCS and CSD recording was performed under anaesthesia with chloralose and urethane. As compared to the baseline velocity of 3.14 mm/min, anodal tDCS induced a significant increase of propagation velocity during the first post-tDCS recording (3.49 mm/min). In contrast to anodal tDCS, neither cathodal tDCS nor sham tDCS, which consisted of an initial ramped DC stimulation lasting only 20 s, showed a significant effect on CSD propagation velocity. As anodal tDCS is known to induce a lasting increase of cortical excitability in the clinical setting, our results support the notion that CSD propagation velocity reflects cortical excitability. Since cortical excitability and susceptibility to CSD is elevated in migraine patients, anodal tDCS - by increasing cortical excitability - might increase the probability of migraine attack in these patients, even beyond the end of its application.", "pages": "85-90"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS): a tool for double-blind sham-controlled clinical studies in brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16427357", "authors": ["Gandiga, PC", "Hummel, FC", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Brain polarization in the form of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which influences motor function and learning processes, has been proposed as an adjuvant strategy to enhance training effects in Neurorehabilitation.

The guiding theory is that impairment of hand function is exacerbated by learned non-use and that this in turn leads to a loss of cortical representation of the upper limb. It is claimed that these processes can be reversed by two weeks of constraint of the unaffected limb combined with intensive practice in use of the paretic hand, and numerous small-scale studies have suggested that CIMT can lead to large improvements in function more than a year after stroke. However, the theory of learned non-use is open to question and there is uncertainty about the nature of the improvements induced by CIMT. The greatest effect seems to be increased spontaneous use of the hand, either through reduction of learned non-use or by overcoming the sense of effort during movement. There is also evidence of some improvement on dexterity tests but no studies have analysed in detail whether this reflects reduction of basic motor impairment or learning of compensatory movement strategies. The current weight of evidence is in favour of compensatory learning. Cortical changes detected by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or functional imaging may reflect this compensatory motor skill learning rather than restoration of representations lost due to the infarct or non-use of the limb. If future studies confirm this then the clinical implication is that direct teaching of unimanual or bimanual compensatory strategies might be a more productive approach than constraint.", "pages": "85-90"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Outlasting excitability shifts induced by direct current stimulation of the human brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15863752", "authors": ["Paulus, W"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Supplements to Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "This study evaluates technical aspects, handling, and safety of intraoperatively applied transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) for eliciting muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs) during cerebral aneurysm surgery.", "pages": "85-90"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "How does transcranial DC stimulation of the primary motor cortex alter regional neuronal activity in the human brain?", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "16106673", "authors": ["Lang, N", "Siebner, HR", "Ward, NS", "Lee, L", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Rothwell, JC", "Lemon, RN", "Frackowiak, RS"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "In 119 patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm surgery, mMEPs were evoked by a train of five stimuli with individual pulse duration of 0.5 milliseconds, a repetition rate of 2 Hz, and constant current anodal stimulation.
