Moreover, it has also been shown that the non-exhausted voluntary motor exercise increases the excitability of corticospinal tract. We conducted this study to define the facilitation effect following anodal tDCS combined with the voluntary grip exercise as compared with single use of tDCS or voluntary grip exercise. Our result showed that the combination of anodal tDCS with voluntary grip exercise produced a 2-fold increase in the amplitude of MEP as compared with single use of anodal tDCS or voluntary grip exercise. In conclusion, our result could indicate that the treatment outcomes of brain and neurorehabilitation using tDCS would be better when tDCS is combined with the appropriate method of voluntary exercise as compared with single use of tDCS.", "pages": "181-4"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "TMS and tDCS in post-stroke aphasia: Integrating novel treatment approaches with mechanisms of plasticity.", "keywords": ["Brain states", "Chronic pain", "Electroencephalography", "Non-pharmacological treatments", "Spinal cord injury"], "issue": "4", "pmid": "23719561", "authors": ["Torres, J", "Drebing, D", "Hamilton, R"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Aphasia is a common result of stroke, affecting over one million Americans.

A growing body of investigations has shown the efficacy of both modalities in facilitating recovery from chronic aphasia, while data regarding subacute aphasia are much more limited and evidence in the acute post-stroke phase are still lacking. Much remains unknown about how these techniques cause clinical improvement or about their long-term efficacy, side-effects, and safety. In this article, we examine the data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of TMS and tDCS, discuss the major differences between them, and consider how those differences may inform the use of each modality.

There is growing evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), when given during cognitive tasks, improves performance. This randomized, controlled trial explored the potential synergistic effects of CT combined with tDCS in healthy participants. Altogether, 60 healthy participants were randomized to receive either active or sham tDCS administered during training on an adaptive CT task (dual n-back task), or tDCS alone, over 10 daily sessions. Cognitive testing (working memory, processing speed, executive function, reaction time) was conducted at baseline, end of the 10 sessions, and at 4-wk follow-up to examine potential transfer effects to non-trained tasks. Altogether, 54 participants completed the study. Over the 10 'online' sessions, participants in the active tDCS+CT condition performed more accurately on the CT task than participants who received sham tDCS+CT. The performance enhancing effect, however, was present only during tDCS and did not result in greater learning (i.e. improvement over sessions) on the CT task. These results confirm prior reports of enhancement of cognitive function during tDCS stimulation. At follow-up, the active tDCS+CT group, but not the sham tDCS+CT group, showed greater gains on a non-trained test of attention and working memory than the tDCS-only group (p < 0.01). Although this gain can mainly be attributable to training, this result suggests that active tDCS may have a role in further enhancing outcomes.", "pages": "181-4"}, {"volume": "154", "title": "Motor and parietal cortex stimulation for phantom limb pain and sensations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "23707312", "authors": ["Bolognini, N", "Olgiati, E", "Maravita, A", "Ferraro, F", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "Brain stimulation therapies have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression and treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has demonstrated efficacy in TRD that is supported by several multicenter randomized controlled trials.

There are not many studies examining the use of tDCS for lower limb motor control and learning. Most studies using tDCS for facilitating lower limb motor coordination have applied tDCS to the lower limb motor cortex (M1). As the cerebellum is also critically involved in movement control, it is important to dissociate the effect of tDCS on the cerebellum and M1 with respect to lower limb motor control before we begin the application of tDCS as a neuromodulatory tool. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cerebellar vs. motor cortical tDCS on short term ankle visuomotor learning in healthy individuals. METHODS: Eight healthy individuals practiced a skilled ankle motor tracking task while receiving either facilitatory anodal tDCS to cerebellum, inhibitory cathodal tDCS to cerebellum, facilitatory anodal tDCS to M1, inhibitory cathodal tDCS to M1 or sham stimulation. Pre- and post-measures of changes in cortical excitability of the tibialis anterior muscle and measures of tracking accuracy were assessed. RESULTS: Anodal cerebellar, cathodal cerebellar, and anodal M1 stimulation improved target-tracking accuracy of the ankle. This was not dependent on the observed changes in motor cortical excitability of the tibialis anterior muscle. CONCLUSION(S): Polarity independent effects of tDCS on cerebellum were observed. The present study shows that modulation effects of tDCS can occur because of changes in the cerebellum, a structure implicated in several forms of motor learning, providing an additional way in which tDCS can be used to improve motor coordination.", "pages": "181-4"}, {"volume": "150", "title": "Talking bodies: nonverbal behavior in the assessment of depression severity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "23706840", "authors": ["Fiquer, JT", "Boggio, PS", "Gorenstein, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate whether one single section of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a neuromodulatory technique that noninvasively modifies cortical excitability, could induce acute changes in the negative attentional bias in patients with major depression. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel design enrolling 24 age-, gender-matched, drug-free, depressed subjects. Anode and cathode were placed over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We performed a word Emotional Stroop Task collecting the response times (RTs) for positive-, negative-, and neutral-related words. The emotional Stroop effect for negative vs. neutral and vs. positive words was used as the measure of attentional bias. RESULTS: At baseline, RTs were significantly slower for negative vs. positive words. We found that active but not sham tDCS significantly modified the negative attentional bias, abolishing slower RT for negative words. CONCLUSION: Active but not sham tDCS significantly modified the negative attentional bias. These findings add evidence that a single tDCS session transiently induces potent changes in affective processing, which might be one of the mechanisms of tDCS underlying mood changes.", "pages": "181-4"}]
