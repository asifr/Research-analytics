The assessment was conducted using a passive high-resolution finite element head model with inhomogeneous and variable anisotropic conductivities derived from the diffusion tensor data. Electric field distribution was evaluated across different cortical as well as subcortical regions under four bicephalic electrode configurations. Results indicate that regional tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy cause the pattern of induced fields to vary in orientation and strength when compared to the isotropic scenario. Different electrode montages resulted in distinct distribution patterns with noticeable variations in field strengths. The effect of anisotropy is highly montage dependent and directional conductivity has a more profound effect in defining the strength of the induced field. The inclusion of anisotropy in the GM and subcortical regions has a significant effect on the strength and spatial distribution of the induced electric field. Under the (C3-Fp2) montage, the inclusion of GM and subcortical anisotropy increased the average percentage difference in the electric field strength of brain from 5% to 34% (WM anisotropy only). In terms of patterns distribution, the topographic errors increased from 9.9% to 40% (WM anisotropy only) across the brain.

Given that most patients with severe deficits have damage to the primary motor cortex or its output pathways, it would be futile to target stimulation to this site. We suggest targeting premotor cortex because it contributes substantially to descending output, a role that is amplified with greater damage to the motor cortex. With regards to clinical investigation, paired cortical stimulation in rehabilitation has been compared to rehabilitation alone in unblinded trials or to unconvincing sham conditions.

Intrinsic recovery, however, is rarely complete. Non-invasive brain stimulation technologies have the potential to actively shape neural circuits and enhance recovery from brain damage. In this study, a stable deficit for detecting and orienting to visual stimuli presented in the contralesional visual hemifield was generated by producing unilateral brain damage of the right posterior parietal and contiguous visual cortical areas. A long regimen of inhibitory non-invasive transcranial direct-current stimulation (cathodal tDCS, 2\u00a0mA, 20\u00a0min) was applied to the contralateral (intact) posterior parietal cortex over 14\u00a0weeks (total of 70 sessions, one per day, 5\u00a0days per week) and behavioral outcomes were periodically assessed. In three out of four stimulated cats, lasting recovery of visuospatial function was observed. Recovery started after 2-3\u00a0weeks of stimulation, and recovered targets were located first in the periphery, and moved to more central visual field locations with the accrual of stimulation sessions. Recovery for moving tasks followed a biphasic pattern before reaching plateau levels. Recovery did not occur for more difficult visual tasks. These findings highlight the ability of multiple sessions of transcranial direct-current stimulation to produce recovery of visuospatial function after unilateral brain damage.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Plasticity.", "keywords": ["TMS", "consolidation", "learning", "memory", "plasticity", "rehabilitation", "tDCS"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24112920", "authors": ["Joseph, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "Drug and alcohol addiction is a debilitating disorder characterized by persistent drug-seeking behaviors despite negative physiological, medical, or social consequences. Neurobiological models of addiction propose that the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs are associated with altered neurotransmission within the reward 'mesocorticolimbic' circuitry in the brain. Immense efforts are therefore designed to target the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in attenuating drug dependence and addiction-related behaviors. Yet, to date, most addiction treatments have demonstrated only limited success in reducing addiction-related behaviors. Accumulating and compelling evidence suggests that novel nonsurgical brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, could serve as promising tools for indexing altered neurotransmission associated with repetitive drug use, and moreover, may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug dependence and addiction-related behaviors.

Among the studies focusing on motor cortical excitability measures, the most consistent finding is a significant reduction of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) in AD and other forms of dementia in which the cholinergic system is affected, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. SAI evaluation may thus provide a reliable biomarker of cortical cholinergic dysfunction in dementias. Moreover, most TMS studies have demonstrated cortical hyperexcitability and asymptomatic motor cortex functional reorganization in the early stages of the disease. Integrated approaches utilizing TMS together with high-density EEG have indicated impaired cortical plasticity and functional connectivity across different neural networks in AD. Paired associative stimulation-induced plasticity has also been found to be abnormal in patients with AD. The development of novel noninvasive methods of brain stimulation, in particular repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has increased the interest in neuromodulatory techniques as potential therapeutic tools for cognitive rehabilitation in AD. Preliminary studies have revealed that rTMS and tDCS can induce beneficial effects on specific cognitive functions in AD.

Despite intensive research effort in recent years, the etiopathogenesis of the disease remains to be elucidated. Recently, much importance has been given to mechanisms underlying the cortical excitability that has been suggested to be dysfunctional in migraine. In recent years, noninvasive brain stimulation techniques based on magnetic fields (transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS) and on direct electrical currents (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) have been shown to be safe and effective tools to explore the issue of cortical excitability, activation, and plasticity in migraine. Moreover, TMS, repetitive TMS (rTMS), and tDCS, thanks to their ability to interfere with and/or modulate cortical activity inducing plastic, persistent effects, have been also explored as potential therapeutic approaches, opening an interesting perspective for noninvasive neurostimulation for both symptomatic and preventive treatment of migraine and other types of headache.

In many of the protocols, general conclusions have been drawn from the motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex. Several of the phenomena induced by noninvasive brain stimulation have been mapped on to cellular physiological mechanisms such as synaptic long-term potentiation or long-term depression.
