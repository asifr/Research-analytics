To further elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms, we recorded corticospinal volleys evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex before and after a 5-min period of anodal or cathodal tDCS in eight conscious patients who had electrodes implanted in the cervical epidural space for the control of pain. The effects of anodal tDCS were evaluated in six subjects and the effects of cathodal tDCS in five subjects. Three subjects were studied with both polarities. Anodal tDCS increased the excitability of cortical circuits generating I waves in the corticospinal system, including the earliest wave (I1 wave), whereas cathodal tDCS suppressed later I waves. The motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude changes immediately following tDCS periods were in agreement with the effects produced on intracortical circuitry. The results deliver additional evidence that tDCS changes the excitability of cortical neurons.", "pages": "2802-10"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "When anger leads to aggression: induction of relative left frontal cortical activity with transcranial direct current stimulation increases the anger-aggression relationship.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "21421731", "authors": ["Hortensius, R", "Schutter, DJ", "Harmon-Jones, E"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Social cognitive and affective neuroscience", "abstract": "The relationship between anger and aggression is imperfect. Based on work on the neuroscience of anger, we predicted that anger associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activation would be more likely to result in aggression. To test this hypothesis, we combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the frontal cortex with interpersonal provocation. Participants received insulting feedback after 15 min of tDCS and were able to aggress by administering noise blasts to the insulting participant. Individuals who received tDCS to increase relative left frontal cortical activity behaved more aggressively when they were angry. No relation between anger and aggression was observed in the increase relative right frontal cortical activity or sham condition. These results concur with the motivational direction model of frontal asymmetry, in which left frontal activity is associated with anger. We propose that anger with approach motivational tendencies is more likely to result in aggression.", "pages": "2802-10"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Combined transcranial direct current stimulation and robot-assisted gait training in patients with chronic stroke: a preliminary comparison.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "16683932", "authors": ["Geroin, C", "Picelli, A", "Munari, D", "Waldner, A", "Tomelleri, C", "Smania, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical rehabilitation", "abstract": "To evaluate whether robot-assisted gait training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation is more effective than robot-assisted gait training alone or conventional walking rehabilitation for improving walking ability in stroke patients.", "pages": "2802-10"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the visual cortex in the prophylactic treatment of migraine.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "20360350", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Kriener, N", "Lang, N", "Boros, K", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache", "abstract": "Pilot randomized clinical trial.", "pages": "2802-10"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Care for child development: basic science rationale and effects of interventions.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "16182596", "authors": ["Holt, RL", "Mikati, MA"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Pediatric neurology", "abstract": "Rehabilitation unit of a university hospital.", "pages": "2802-10"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation suppresses ipsilateral projections to presumed propriospinal neurons of the proximal upper limb.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "19733618", "authors": ["Bradnam, LV", "Stinear, CM", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Thirty patients with chronic stroke.", "pages": "2802-10"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation modulates the spinal plasticity induced with patterned electrical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "8656311", "authors": ["Fujiwara, T", "Tsuji, T", "Honaga, K", "Hase, K", "Ushiba, J", "Liu, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "All patients received ten 50-minute treatment sessions, five days a week, for two consecutive weeks.
