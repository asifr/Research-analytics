Convergent methods from psychophysics, voxel-based morphometry, and diffusion tensor imaging with normal and tone-deaf (TD) subjects have shown that neural networks controlling pitch perception and production systems include bilateral frontotemporal networks. Although psychophysical and neuroimaging results are suggestive of a superior temporal and inferior frontal network responsible for pitch perception and production, active intervention of these areas is necessary to establish a causal connection between superior temporal and inferior frontal areas and pitch production ability. We sought to reverse-engineer the pitch perception-production network by noninvasive brain stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain-stimulation technique that is optimal for auditory research, was applied over superior temporal and inferior frontal regions. Pitch matching ability was assessed using an individually optimized pitch matching task administered after each stimulation session. Results showed diminished accuracy in pitch matching after cathodal stimulation over inferior frontal and superior temporal areas compared to sham control. Results demonstrate that intact function and connectivity of a distributed cortical network, centered around bilateral superior temporal and inferior frontal regions, are required for efficient neural interactions with musical sounds.", "pages": "50002"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation and motor recovery after stroke.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20714076", "authors": ["Nowak, DA", "B\u00f6sl, K", "Podubeck\u00e0, J", "Carey, JR"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Upper limb function is the best predictor of long-term disability after stroke.

In a sham controlled, double-blind, parallel group design, 39 patients were randomized into four groups receiving transcranial direct current stimulation with walking visual illusion or with control illusion and sham stimulation with visual illusion or with control illusion. For transcranial direct current stimulation, the anode was placed over the primary motor cortex. Each patient received ten treatment sessions during two consecutive weeks. Clinical assessment was performed before, after the last day of treatment, after 2 and 4 weeks follow-up and after 12 weeks. Clinical assessment included overall pain intensity perception, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory. The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion reduced the intensity of neuropathic pain significantly more than any of the single interventions. Patients receiving transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion experienced a significant improvement in all pain subtypes, while patients in the transcranial direct current stimulation group showed improvement in continuous and paroxysmal pain, and those in the visual illusion group improved only in continuous pain and dysaesthesias. At 12 weeks after treatment, the combined treatment group still presented significant improvement on the overall pain intensity perception, whereas no improvements were reported in the other three groups. Our results demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion can be effective in the management of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury, with minimal side effects and with good tolerability.", "pages": "50002"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Improved proper name recall by electrical stimulation of the anterior temporal lobes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "16002441", "authors": ["Ross, LA", "McCoy, D", "Wolk, DA", "Coslett, HB", "Olson, IR"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "Our visual memories are susceptible to errors, but less so in people who have a more literal cognitive style.

Our stimulation protocol included 3 conditions, each with 12 neurotypical participants: (i) left cathodal stimulation together with right anodal stimulation, (ii) left anodal stimulation together with right cathodal stimulation, and (iii) sham (control) stimulation. Only participants who received left cathodal stimulation (decrease in excitability) together with right anodal stimulation (increase in excitability) showed an improvement in visual memory. This 110% improvement in visual memory was similar to the advantage people with autism, who are known to be more literal, show over normal people in the identical visual task. Importantly, participants receiving stimulation of the opposite polarity (left anodal together with right cathodal stimulation) failed to show any change in memory performance.
