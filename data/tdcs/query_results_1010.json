It can enhance motor learning and working memory in healthy subjects. To investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (1 mA, 20 min) of the dominant and non-dominant primary motor cortex (M1) on hand motor performance in healthy right-handed volunteers, healthy subjects underwent one session of both sham and active anodal stimulation of the non-dominant or dominant primary motor cortex. A blinded rater assessed motor function using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. For the non-dominant hand, active tDCS was able to improve motor function significantly-there was a significant interaction between time and condition of stimulation (p = 0.003). Post hoc tests showed a significant enhancement of JTT performance after 1 mA anodal tDCS of M1 (mean improvement of 9.41%, p = 0.0004), but not after sham tDCS (mean improvement of 1.3%, p = 0.84). For the dominant hand, however, neither active nor sham tDCS resulted in a significant change in motor performance. Our findings show that anodal tDCS of the non-dominant primary motor cortex results in motor function enhancement and thus confirm and extend the notion that tDCS can change behavior. We speculate that the under-use of the non-dominant hand with its associated consequences in cortical plasticity might be one of the reasons to explain motor performance enhancement in the non-dominant hand only.", "pages": "232-6"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Intraoperative motor-evoked potential monitoring in scoliosis surgery: comparison of desflurane/nitrous oxide with propofol total intravenous anesthetic regimens.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16799350", "authors": ["Lo, YL", "Dan, YF", "Tan, YE", "Nurjannah, S", "Tan, SB", "Tan, CT", "Raman, S"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology", "abstract": "A prospective, randomized study in a large general hospital setting.", "pages": "232-6"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Testing for causality with transcranial direct current stimulation: pitch memory and the left supramarginal gyrus.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "16791101", "authors": ["Vines, BW", "Schnider, NM", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "During spinal surgery, monitoring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) is a means of assessing the intraoperative integrity of corticospinal pathways.

Only cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the left supramarginal gyrus had a detrimental effect on short-term pitch-memory performance in 11 adult participants.
