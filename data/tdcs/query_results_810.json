Recent studies have shown that some of these techniques induce significant neurophysiological and clinical effects. Although recent results are promising, there are several techniques that have been abandoned despite positive initial results. In this study, we performed a systematic review to identify NIBS methods with promising preliminary clinical results that were not fully developed and adopted into clinical practice, and discuss its clinical, research and device characteristics. We identified five devices (transmeatal cochlear laser stimulation, transcranial micropolarization, transcranial electrostimulation, cranial electric stimulation and stimulation with weak electromagnetic fields) and compared them with two established NIBS devices (transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) and with well-known drugs used in neuropsychiatry (pramipexole and escitalopram) in order to understand the reasons why they failed to reach clinical practice and further steps of research development. Finally, we also discuss novel NIBS devices that have recently showed promising results: brain ultrasound and transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation. Our results show that some of the reasons for the failure of NIBS devices with promising clinical findings are the difficulty to disseminate results, lack of controlled studies, duration of research development, mixed results and lack of standardization.", "pages": "67-97"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on chronic neuropathic pain in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "20018567", "authors": ["Mori, F", "Codec\u00e0, C", "Kusayanagi, H", "Monteleone, F", "Buttari, F", "Fiore, S", "Bernardi, G", "Koch, G", "Centonze, D"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society", "abstract": "Neuropathic pain in patients with MS is frequent and is associated with a great interference with daily life activities. In the present study, we investigated whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be effective in reducing central chronic pain in MS patients. Patients received sham tDCS or real tDCS in a 5-day period of treatment in a randomized, double blind, sham-controlled study. Pain was measured using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the short form McGill questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Quality of life was measured using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 scale (MSQoL-54). Depressive symptoms and anxiety were also evaluated as confounding factors using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and VAS for anxiety. Evaluations were performed at baseline, immediately after the end of treatment, and once a week during a 3-week follow-up period. Following anodal but not sham tDCS over the motor cortex, there was a significant pain improvement as assessed by VAS for pain and McGill questionnaire, and of overall quality of life. No depression or anxiety changes were observed. Our results show that anodal tDCS is able to reduce pain-scale scores in MS patients with central chronic pain and that this effect outlasts the period of stimulation, leading to long-lasting clinical effects.", "pages": "67-97"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in a patient with therapy-resistant major depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4 Pt 2", "pmid": "19995213", "authors": ["Palm, U", "Keeser, D", "Schiller, C", "Fintescu, Z", "Reisinger, E", "Baghai, TC", "Mulert, C", "Padberg, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry", "abstract": "This article presents a new, noninvasive therapeutic approach to chronic, central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, poorly responsive to current conventional medications. tDCS is known to cause long-lasting changes of neuronal excitability at the site of stimulation and in the connected areas in healthy subjects.

Several recent studies found an improvement of depressive symptoms in drug-free patients. Here we report the case of a 66-year-old female patient suffering from recurrent major depressive episodes who underwent anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral PFC over 4 weeks as an add-on treatment to a stable antidepressant medication. Only a modest improvement of depressive symptoms was observed after tDCS, i.e. reduction of the baseline scores in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from 23 to 19 and in the Beck Depression Inventory from 27 to 20. However, there was an increase from 52 to 90% in the Regensburg Verbal Fluency Test. In addition, EEG was used to assess the acute effects of tDCS. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed a left unilateral focal effect (25-40% reduced power) in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. The same effect appeared in the surface analysis of the EEG. The absolute, as well as the relative power decreased significantly in the delta, theta and alpha bands after a comparison of the spectral analysis. Though tDCS over 4 weeks did not exert clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in this case of therapy-resistant depression, the findings for cognitive measures and EEG suggest that beneficial effects may occur in depressed subjects and future studies need to further explore this approach also in therapy-resistant major depression.", "pages": "67-97"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "Comparing different electrode configurations using the 10-10 international system in tDCS: a finite element model analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "10636138", "authors": ["Faria, P", "Leal, A", "Miranda, PC"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Knowledge of the current density distribution is an important factor in optimizing such applications of tDCS. We use the finite element method to compare three different models in tDCS, where the stimulation electrodes (EEG electrodes) are placed in the 10-10 international system coordinates. We studied the focality and the distribution of the current density in depth and at the surface of the brain for three different electrode configurations. We show that the use of EEG electrodes increases the focality of tDCS, especially when one cathode and several anodes are used. Additionally, these electrodes need less injected current, can be placed at scalp positions whose relationship with the underlying cerebral cortex are known and allow the use of tDCS and EEG recording concomitantly.", "pages": "67-97"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Response-dependent contributions of human primary motor cortex and angular gyrus to manual and perceptual sequence learning.", "keywords": [], "issue": "48", "pmid": "12686268", "authors": ["Rosenthal, CR", "Roche-Kelly, EE", "Husain, M", "Kennard, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "The neocortex is the most common target of sub-dural electrotherapy and non-invasive brain stimulation modalities including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current simulation (tDCS). Specific neuronal elements targeted by cortical stimulation are considered to underlie therapeutic effects, but the exact cell-type(s) affected by these methods remains poorly understood. We determined if neuronal morphology predicted responses to subthreshold uniform electric fields. We characterized the effects of subthreshold electrical stimulation on identified cortical neurons in vitro. Uniform electric fields were applied to rat motor cortex brain slices, while recording from interneurons and pyramidal cells across cortical layers, using whole cell patch clamp. Neuron morphology was reconstructed following intracellular dialysis of biocytin. Based solely on volume-weighted morphology, we developed a simplified model of neuronal polarization by sub-threshold electric field: an electrotonically linear cylinder that further predicts polarization at distal dendritic tree terminations. We found that neuronal morphology correlated with somatic sub-threshold polarization. Layer V/VI pyramidal neuron somata (individually) and dendrites (averaging across neurons) were most sensitive to sub-threshold fields. This analysis was extended to predict a terminal polarization of a human cortical neuron as 1.44 mV during tDCS.", "pages": "67-97"}]
