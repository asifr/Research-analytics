This top-down modulation may play a major role in the neuroendocrine changes associated with stressful events. We aimed to investigate further this hypothesis by modulating directly prefrontal cortex excitability using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - a non-invasive, neuromodulatory tool that induces polarity-dependent changes in cortical excitability - and measuring effects on salivary cortisol and heart rate variability as proxies of the HPA and SAM systems. Twenty healthy participants with no clinical and neuropsychiatric conditions were randomized to receive bifrontal tDCS (left anodal/right cathodal or left cathodal/right anodal) or sham stimulation, in a within-subject design. During each stimulation session, after a resting period, subjects were shown images with neutral or negative valence. Our findings showed that excitability enhancing left anodal tDCS induced a decrease in cortisol levels. This effect is more pronounced during emotional negative stimuli. Moreover, vagal activity was higher during left anodal tDCS and emotional negative stimuli, as compared to sham stimulation and neutral images. We also observed an association between higher mood scores, higher vagal activation and lower cortisol levels for anodal stimulation. Subjective mood and anxiety evaluation revealed no specific changes after stimulation. Our findings suggest that tDCS induced transient, polarity specific modulatory top-down effects with anodal tDCS leading to a down-regulation of HPA and SAM systems. Further research using tDCS and neuroendocrine markers should explore the mechanisms of stress regulation in healthy and clinical samples.", "pages": "58-66"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "When less is more: evidence for a facilitative cathodal tDCS effect in attentional abilities.", "keywords": ["antisaccade", "frontal eyefield", "saccade", "transcranial direct current stimulation"], "issue": "9", "pmid": "22624605", "authors": ["Weiss, M", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Many previous studies reported that the hyperpolarization of cortical neurons following cathodal stimulation (in transcranial direct current stimulation) has resulted in cognitive performance degradation. Here, we challenge this assumption by showing that cathodal stimulation will not always degrade cognitive performance. We used an attentional load paradigm in which irrelevant stimuli are processed only under low but not under high attentional load. Thirty healthy participants were randomly allocated into three interventional groups with different brain stimulation parameters (active anodal posterior parietal cortex [PPC], active cathodal PPC, and sham). Cathodal but not anodal stimulation enabled flanker processing even in high-loaded scenes. A second experiment was carried out to assert whether the improved flanker processing under cathodal stimulation is because of altered attention allocation between center and surround or, alternatively, enhanced attentional resources. In this experiment, the flanker was presented centrally. The results of Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1's finding of improved flanker processing. We interpret the results from these two experiments as evidence for the ability of cathodal stimulation to enhance attentional resources rather than simply change attention allocation between center and periphery. Cathodal stimulation in high-loaded scenes can act like a noise filter and may in fact enhance cognitive performance. This study contributes to understanding the way the PPC is engaged with attentional functions and explains the cathodal effects, which thus might lead to more efficient brain stimulation protocols.", "pages": "58-66"}, {"volume": "108", "title": "Modulation of soleus H reflex by spinal DC stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22623482", "authors": ["Lamy, JC", "Ho, C", "Badel, A", "Arrigo, RT", "Boakye, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex induces changes in excitability within cortical and spinal circuits that occur during and after the stimulation. Recently, transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) has been shown to modulate spinal conduction properties, as assessed by somatosensory-evoked potentials, and transynaptic properties of the spinal neurons, as tested by postactivation depression of the H reflex or by the RIII nociceptive component of the flexion reflex in the lower limb. To further explore tsDCS-induced plastic changes in spinal excitability, we examined, in a double-blind crossover randomized study, the stimulus-response curves of the soleus H reflex before, during, at current offset and 15 min after anodal, cathodal, and sham tsDCS delivered at the Th11 level (2.5 mA, 15 min, 0.071 mA/cm(2), 0.064 C/cm(2)) in 17 healthy subjects. Anodal tsDCS induced a progressive leftward shift of the recruitment curve of the soleus H reflex during the stimulation; the effects persisted for at least 15 min after current offset. In contrast, both cathodal and sham tsDCS had no significant effects. This exploratory study provides further evidence for the use of tsDCS as an expedient, noninvasive tool to induce long-lasting plastic changes in spinal circuitry. Increased spinal excitability after anodal tsDCS may have potential for spinal neuromodulation in patients with central nervous system lesions.", "pages": "58-66"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Modulation of training by single-session transcranial direct current stimulation to the intact motor cortex enhances motor skill acquisition of the paretic hand.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "22618381", "authors": ["Zimerman, M", "Heise, KF", "Hoppe, J", "Cohen, LG", "Gerloff, C", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Mechanisms of skill learning are paramount components for stroke recovery.

Thus alternative therapeutic strategies such as non-invasive brain stimulation are needed. Few studies have demonstrated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method of neuromodulation with consecutive robust excitability changes within the stimulated cortex area, is beneficial in AD. There is also evidence that tDCS enhances memory function in cognitive rehabilitation in depressive patients, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. tDCS improves working and visual recognition memory in humans and object-recognition learning in the elderly. AD's neurobiological mechanisms comprise changes in neuronal activity and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) caused by altered microvasculature, synaptic dysregulation from \u00df-amyloid peptide accumulation, altered neuromodulation via degenerated modulatory amine transmitter systems, altered brain oscillations, and changes in network connectivity. tDCS alters (i) neuronal activity and (ii) human CBF, (iii) has synaptic and non-synaptic after-effects (iv), can modify neurotransmitters polarity-dependently, (v) and alter oscillatory brain activity and (vi) functional connectivity patterns in the brain. It thus is reasonable to use tDCS as a therapeutic instrument in AD as it improves cognitive function in manner based on a disease mechanism. Moreover, it could prove valuable in other types of dementia.
