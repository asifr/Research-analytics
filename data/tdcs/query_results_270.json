Conference", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation which uses weak electric currents applied on the scalp to modulate activity of underlying brain tissue. In addition to being used as a tool for cognitive neuroscience investigations, tDCS has generated considerable interest for use as a therapeutic modality for neurologic disorders. Though the safety and tolerability of tDCS in adults is well-established, there is little information on the safety of tDCS in children. Because there are differences between children and adults in several key parameters (such as skull thickness and cerebrospinal fluid volume) which affect current flow through the brain, special consideration should be given to the stimulation parameters which are used in a pediatric study population. In this study we present cortical electrical field maps at different stimulation intensities and electrode configurations using a high-resolution-MRI derived finite element model of a typically developing, anatomically normal 12 year old child. The peak electrical fields for a given stimulus intensity in the adolescent brain were twice as high as in the adult brain for conventional tDCS and nearly four times as high for a 4X1 High-Definition tDCS electrode configuration. These data suggest that acceptable tDCS stimulation parameters may be different in children compared to adults, and that further modeling studies are needed to help guide decisions about applied current intensity.", "pages": "859-62"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation induces current pulses in transcranial direct current stimulation electrodes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "20435146", "authors": ["Peterchev, AV", "Dhamne, SC", "Kothare, R", "Rotenberg, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method for focal brain stimulation where small intracranial currents are induced by a pulsed magnetic field. TMS can be applied simultaneously with tDCS to probe brain excitability or to effect synergistic neuromodulation. Delivering TMS simultaneously with tDCS can induce electric current pulses in the tDCS electrodes even when the tDCS device is turned off or is set to 0 mA output, as long as the electrodes are connected to the tDCS current source. The output impedance of commercial tDCS devices is in the range of 2-5 k\u2126 which can allow substantial currents to be induced by TMS. In a rat TMS-tDCS setup, the induced currents are comparable to the tDCS current magnitude. To mitigate the induced currents, the area of the loop formed by the tDCS electrode leads should be minimized and the impedance of the tDCS circuit at TMS pulses frequencies (1-10 kHz) should be maximized.", "pages": "859-62"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Effects of tissue dielectric properties on the electric field induced in tDCS: a sensitivity analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22037128", "authors": ["Salvador, R", "Ramirez, F", "V'yacheslavovna, M", "Miranda, PC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Conference", "abstract": "Numerical modeling studies remain the only viable way to accurately predict the electric field (E-field) distribution in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Despite the existence of multiple studies of this kind, a wide range of different values and properties for the electrical conductivities of the tissues represented is employed. This makes it difficult to predict whether the changes observed between models are due to differences in the geometries of the volume conductors or to the different electrical properties of the tissues. In this study we used the finite element method to calculate the E-field distribution in several spherical head models whose tissues were represented with different isotropic and anisotropic conductivity profiles. Results show that the distribution of the E-field is especially sensitive to the conductivity of the skull, skin and GM. These results might help comparing numerical modeling studies that employ different conductivity values.", "pages": "859-62"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "A pilot study on effects of 4\u00d71 high-definition tDCS on motor cortex excitability.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "21613470", "authors": ["Caparelli-Daquer, EM", "Zimmermann, TJ", "Mooshagian, E", "Parra, LC", "Rice, JK", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Wassermann, EM"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Here we provide the first evidence of a change in cortical excitability after HD-tDCS of the motor cortex, using TMS motor evoked potential (MEP) as the measure of excitability. Stimulation for 20 minutes at 1 mA with an anode centered over the hand area of the motor cortex and four surrounding return electrodes (anodal 4\u00d71 montage) produced a significant increase in MEP amplitude and variability after stimulation, compared to sham stimulation. Stimulation was well tolerated by all subjects with adverse effects limited to transient sensation under the electrodes. A high-resolution computational model confirmed predictions of increased focality using the 4\u00d71 HD tDCS montage compared to conventional tDCS. Simulations also indicated that variability in placement of the center electrode relative to the location of the target (central sulcus) could account for increasing variability. These results provide support for the careful use of this technique where focal tDCS is desired.", "pages": "859-62"}, {"volume": "2013", "title": "The ABC of tDCS: Effects of Anodal, Bilateral and Cathodal Montages of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Patients with Stroke-A Pilot Study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "21885255", "authors": ["Fusco, A", "De Angelis, D", "Morone, G", "Maglione, L", "Paolucci, T", "Bragoni, M", "Venturiero, V"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Stroke research and treatment", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique that is emerging as a prospective therapy for different neurologic disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated that anodal and cathodal stimulation can improve motor performance in terms of dexterity and manual force. The objective of this study was to determine whether different electrodes' setups (anodal, cathodal, and simultaneous bilateral tDCS) provide different motor performance and which montage was more effective. As secondary outcome, we have asked to the patients about their satisfaction, and to determine if the bilateral tDCS was more uncomfortable than unilateral tDCS. Nine patients with stroke in subacute phase were enrolled in this study and randomly divided in three groups. Our results showed that tDCS was an effective treatment if compared to Sham stimulation (P = 0.022). In particular, anodal stimulation provided the higher improvement in terms of manual dexterity. Cathodal stimulation seemed to have a little effect in terms of force improvement, not observed with other setups. Bipolar stimulation seemed to be the less effective. No significant differences have been noted for the different set-ups for patients' judgment.

Along with peripheral therapies, tDCS can lead to subsequent sustained behavioral and clinical gains in patients with stroke.
