Additional neuromodulation strategies are being developed that aim to match or exceed the efficacy of ECT/ablative surgery with a better neurocognitive side effect profile. In this review, we briefly discuss the neurocognitive effects of ECT and ablative neurosurgical procedures, then synthesize the available neurocognitive information for emerging neuromodulation therapies, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. The available evidence suggests these procedures may be more cognitively benign relative to ECT or ablative neurosurgical procedures, though further research is clearly needed to fully evaluate the neurocognitive effects, both positive and negative, of these novel neuromodulation interventions.", "pages": "38-42"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "[Influence of transcranial direct current stimulation on cognitive functioning of patients with brain injury].", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "20633396", "authors": ["Polanowska, K", "Seni\u00f3w, J"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska", "abstract": "despite advances in pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, a large percentage of persons with schizophrenia remain at least partially nonresponsive to treatment, leading to increased morbidity/mortality, increased healthcare cost, and poor quality of life for affected individuals.", "pages": "38-42"}, {"volume": "76", "title": "Rethinking the thinking cap: ethics of neural enhancement using noninvasive brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Hamilton, R", "Messing, S", "Chatterjee, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "this paper comprises a review of recent research in drug therapy for schizophrenia, particularly treatment-refractory schizophrenia, with a focus on research conducted between 2005 and June 2010.
