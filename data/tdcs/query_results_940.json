We attempted to demonstrate the cortical stimulation effect of tDCS on the primary motor cortex (M1) using functional MRI (fMRI). An fMRI study was performed for 11 right-handed healthy subjects at 1.5 T. Anodal tDCS was applied to the scalp over the central knob of the M1 in the left hemisphere. A constant current with an intensity of 1.0 mA was applied. The total fMRI paradigm consisted of three sessions with a 5-min resting period between each session. Each session consisted of five successive phases (resting-tDCS-tDCS-tDCS-tDCS), and each of the phases was performed for 21s. Our findings revealed that no cortical activation was detected in any of the stimulation phases except the fourth tDCS phase. In the result of group analysis for the fourth tDCS phase, the average map indicated that the central knob of the left primary motor cortex was activated. In addition, there were activations on the left supplementary motor cortex and the right posterior parietal cortex. We demonstrated that tDCS has a direct stimulation effect on the underlying cortex. It seems that tDCS is a useful modality for stimulating a target cortical region.", "pages": "56-9"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Premotor transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects primary motor excitability in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "18312584", "authors": ["Boros, K", "Poreisz, C", "M\u00fcnchau, A", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the premotor cortex (PM) modifies the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a new method to induce neuroplasticity in humans non-invasively. tDCS generates neuroplasticity directly in the cortical area under the electrode, but might also induce effects in distant brain areas, caused by activity modulation of interconnected areas. However, this has not yet been tested electrophysiologically. We aimed to study whether premotor tDCS can modify the excitability of the ipsilateral M1 via cortico-cortical connectivity. Sixteen subjects received cathodal and anodal tDCS of the PM and eight subjects of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Premotor anodal, but not premotor cathodal or prefrontal tDCS, modified selectively short intracortical inhibition/intracortical facilitation (SICI/ICF), while motor thresholds, single test-pulse motor-evoked potential and input-output curves were stable throughout the experiments. Specifically, anodal tDCS decreased intracortical inhibition and increased paired-pulse excitability. The selective influence of premotor tDCS on intracortical excitability of the ipsilateral M1 suggests a connectivity-driven effect of tDCS on remote cortical areas. Moreover, this finding indirectly substantiates the efficacy of tDCS to modulate premotor excitability, which might be of interest for applications in diseases accompanied by pathological premotor activity.", "pages": "56-9"}, {"volume": "69", "title": "Cortical stimulation of the prefrontal cortex with transcranial direct current stimulation reduces cue-provoked smoking craving: a randomized, sham-controlled study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "18312035", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Liguori, P", "Fecteau, S", "Nitsche, MA", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Boggio, PS"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The Journal of clinical psychiatry", "abstract": "Because neuroimaging studies have shown that cue-provoked smoking craving is associated with changes in the activity of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we aimed to investigate whether a powerful technique of noninvasive brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), reduces cue-provoked smoking craving as indexed by a visual analog scale.", "pages": "56-9"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation improves language learning.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "18303984", "authors": ["Fl\u00f6el, A", "R\u00f6sser, N", "Michka, O", "Knecht, S", "Breitenstein, C"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "We performed a randomized, sham-controlled crossover study in which 24 subjects received sham and active tDCS (anodal tDCS of the left and right DLPFC) in a randomized order.

However, relatively little is known about the direction, magnitude and distribution of induced fields and current flow in tissue, and optimal setup characteristics remain largely undetermined. Further, the profound influence of brain size and shape as well as of brain tissue irregularity on actual stimulation patterns is unclear. We model the conductive phenomena induced in brain tissue by TMS by solving the quasistatic problem over a realistic head model of 1mm resolution derived from anatomical MRI scans using a finite difference successive overrelaxation procedure. The magnetic field is calculated from digitized coil geometry and realistic stimulator parameters. Stimulation with a symmetrical primary electric field results in electric field and current density distributions which are highly asymmetrical both in magnitude and in direction (i.e. distributed, non-contiguous stimulation peaks, deviation of stimulated area from coil \"hot spot\", sudden jumps in stimulation intensity and non-zero current flow across tissue interfaces). Knowledge of coil and stimulator specifications alone is hence not sufficient to control stimulation conditions, and a stereotaxic setup coupled with an individually adjusted field solver appears essential in performing reliable TMS studies.

Visual evoked potentials (VEPs), phosphene thresholds (PTs), and contrast sensitivity measurements (CSs) are used as indicators of the excitability of the primary visual cortex. The data revealed that cathodally induced excitability effects 10 min post stimulation with tDCS, showed no significant difference between genders.
