In this work, we investigated the feasibility of using noninvasive stimulation to the parietal lobe during numerical learning to selectively improve numerical abilities. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), a method that can selectively inhibit or excitate neuronal populations by modulating GABAergic (anodal stimulation) and glutamatergic (cathodal stimulation) activity [5, 6]. We trained subjects for 6 days with artificial numerical symbols, during which we applied concurrent TDCS to the parietal lobes. The polarity of the brain stimulation specifically enhanced or impaired the acquisition of automatic number processing and the mapping of number into space, both important indices of numerical proficiency [7-9]. The improvement was still present 6 months after the training. Control tasks revealed that the effect of brain stimulation was specific to the representation of artificial numerical symbols. The specificity and longevity of TDCS on numerical abilities establishes TDCS as a realistic tool for intervention in cases of atypical numerical development or loss of numerical abilities because of stroke or degenerative illnesses.", "pages": "2016-20"}, {"volume": "207", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation affects visual perception measured by threshold perimetry.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "17379521", "authors": ["Kraft, A", "Roehmel, J", "Olma, MC", "Schmidt, S", "Irlbacher, K", "Brandt, SA"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Distinct eccentricities were investigated separately, since at the cortical level, more central regions of the visual field are represented closer to the occipital pole, i.e. closer to the polarizing electrodes, than are the more peripheral regions. Using a double-blind and sham-controlled within-subject design, we measured the effect of stimulation and potential learning effect separately across testing days. Anodal stimulation of the visual cortex compared to sham stimulation yielded a significant increase in contrast sensitivity within 8\u00b0 of the visual field. A significant increase in contrast sensitivity between the conditions \"pre\" and \"post\" anodal stimulation was only obtained for the central positions at eccentricities smaller than 2\u00b0. Cathodal stimulation of the visual cortex did not affect contrast sensitivity at either eccentricity. Perceptual learning across testing days was only observed for threshold perimetry before stimulation. Measuring contrast sensitivity changes after tDCS with a standard clinical tool such as threshold perimetry may provide an interesting perspective in assessing therapeutic effects of tDCS in ophthalmological or neurological defects (e.g. with foveal sparing vs. foveal splitting).", "pages": "2016-20"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Comparing cutaneous perception induced by electrical stimulation using rectangular and round shaped electrodes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11741375", "authors": ["Ambrus, GG", "Antal, A", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "We have investigated the cutaneous perception differences for anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) between two electrode configurations: a standard, rectangle-shaped, and a circle-shaped, round geometry with the same surface area, and thus, same nominal current distribution.

Invasive procedures comprise peripheral nerve stimulation (particularly occipital nerve stimulation), vagus nerve stimulation, cervical spinal cord stimulation and hypothalamic deep brain stimulation. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive variants. Based on current neuroimaging, neurophysiological and clinical studies occipital nerve stimulation and hypothalamic deep brain stimulation are recommended for patients with chronic cluster headache. Less convincing evidence can be found for their use in other refractory headaches such as chronic migraine. No clear recommendation can be given for the other neuromodulatory techniques. The emerging concept of intermittent stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion is nonetheless promising. Robust randomized and sham-controlled multicenter studies are needed before these therapeutic approaches are widely implemented. Due to the experimental nature all patients should be treated in clinical studies. It is essential to confirm the correct headache diagnosis and the refractory nature before an invasive approach is considered. Patients should generally be referred to specialized interdisciplinary outpatient departments which closely collaborate with neurosurgeons who are experienced in the implantation of neuromodulatory devices.
