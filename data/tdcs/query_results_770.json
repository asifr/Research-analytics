We previously found that patients with parietal lobe damage exhibited a selective WM impairment on recognition but not recall tasks. We hypothesized that this dissociation reflected strategic differences in the utilization of attention. One concern was that these findings, and our subsequent interpretation, would not generalize to normal populations because of the patients' older age, progressive disease processes, and/or possible brain reorganization following injury. To test whether our findings extended to a normal population we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to right inferior parietal cortex. tDCS is a technique by which low electric current applied to the scalp modulates the resting potentials of underlying neural populations and can be used to test structure-function relationships. Eleven normal young adults received cathodal, anodal, or sham stimulation over right inferior posterior parietal cortex and then performed separate blocks of an object WM task probed by recall or recognition. The results showed that cathodal stimulation selectively impaired WM on recognition trials. These data replicate and extend our previous findings of preserved WM recall and impaired WM recognition in patients with parietal lobe lesions.", "pages": "312-6"}, {"volume": "121", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor cortex induces distinct changes in thermal and mechanical sensory percepts.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Bachmann, CG", "Muschinsky, S", "Nitsche, MA", "Rolke, R", "Magerl, W", "Treede, RD", "Paulus, W", "Happe, S"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The aim of this single-blinded, complete crossover study was to evaluate the effects of tDCS on thermal and mechanical perception, as assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST).", "pages": "312-6"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation as a treatment for Parkinson's disease--interesting, but not ready for prime time.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "20350607", "authors": ["Chen, R"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "QST was performed upon the radial part of both hands of eight healthy subjects (3 female, 5 male, 25-41years of age).

This is achieved by weak direct currents to shift the resting potential of cortical neurons. These currents are applied by attaching two electrodes (usually one anode and one cathode) to distinct areas of the skull. Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a variant of tDCS where the electrodes are attached to the mastoids behind the ears in order to stimulate the vestibular system. tDCS and GVS are safe when standard procedures are used. We describe the basic physiological mechanisms and application of these procedures. We also review current data on the effects of tDCS and GVS in healthy subjects as well as clinical populations. Significant effects of such stimulation have been reported for motor, visual, somatosensory, attentional, vestibular and cognitive/emotional function as well as for a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, both techniques may induce neuroplastic changes which make them promising techniques in the field of neurorehabilitation. A number of open research questions that could be addressed with tDCS or GVS are formulated in the domains of sensory and motor processing, spatial and nonspatial attention including neglect, spatial cognition and body cognition disorders, as well as novel treatments for various neuropsychological disorders. We conclude that the literature suggests that tDCS and GVS are exciting and easily applicable research tools for neuropsychological as well as clinical-therapeutic investigations.", "pages": "312-6"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on episodic memory related to emotional visual stimuli.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "15040547", "authors": ["Penolazzi, B", "Di Domenico, A", "Marzoli, D", "Mammarella, N", "Fairfield, B", "Franciotti, R", "Brancucci, A", "Tommasi, L"], "year": "2010", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "The mu event-related desynchronization (ERD) is supposed to reflect motor preparation and appear during motor imagery.
