Despite the proven effectiveness of the convulsive techniques, amongst them electroconvulsive therapy ECT, investigations over sub(non) convulsive methods were continued. The paper describes and contains a systematisation trial of the sub(non)convulsive techniques applied in the period of past decades in the therapy of psychical disorders. Their clinical effectiveness is low, and investigations over them have mainly a cognitive value.", "pages": "505-18"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Functional and histologic changes after repeated transcranial direct current stimulation in rat stroke model.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "20890433", "authors": ["Kim, SJ", "Kim, BK", "Ko, YJ", "Bang, MS", "Kim, MH", "Han, TR"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of Korean medical science", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is associated with enhancement or weakening of the NMDA receptor activity and change of the cortical blood flow. Therefore, repeated tDCS of the brain with cerebrovascular injury will induce the functional and histologic changes. Sixty-one Sprague-Dawley rats with cerebrovascular injury were used. Twenty rats died during the experimental course. The 41 rats that survived were allocated to the exercise group, the anodal stimulation group, the cathodal stimulation group, or the control group according to the initial motor function. Two-week treatment schedules started from 2 days postoperatively. Garcia, modified foot fault, and rota-rod performance scores were checked at 2, 9, and 16 days postoperatively. After the experiments, rats were sacrificed for the evaluation of histologic changes (changes of the white matter axon and infarct volume). The anodal stimulation and exercise groups showed improvement of Garcia's and modified foot fault scores at 16 days postoperatively. No significant change of the infarct volume happened after exercise and tDCS. Neuronal axons at the internal capsule of infarct hemispheres showed better preserved axons in the anodal stimulation group. From these results, repeated tDCS might have a neuroprotective effect on neuronal axons in rat stroke model.", "pages": "505-18"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "The involvement of the left motor cortex in learning of a novel action word lexicon.", "keywords": [], "issue": "19", "pmid": "17370780", "authors": ["Liuzzi, G", "Freundlieb, N", "Ridder, V", "Hoppe, J", "Heise, K", "Zimerman, M", "Dobel, C", "Enriquez-Geppert, S", "Gerloff, C", "Zwitserlood, P", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Current theoretical positions assume that action-related word meanings are established by functional connections between perisylvian language areas and the motor cortex (MC) according to Hebb's associative learning principle. To test this assumption, we probed the functional relevance of the left MC for learning of a novel action word vocabulary by disturbing neural plasticity in the MC with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In combination with tDCS, subjects learned a novel vocabulary of 76 concrete, body-related actions by means of an associative learning paradigm. Compared with a control condition with \"sham\" stimulation, cathodal tDCS reduced success rates in vocabulary acquisition, as shown by tests of novel action word translation into the native language. The analysis of learning behavior revealed a specific effect of cathodal tDCS on the ability to associatively couple actions with novel words. In contrast, we did not find these effects in control experiments, when tDCS was applied to the prefrontal cortex or when subjects learned object-related words. The present study lends direct evidence to the proposition that the left MC is causally involved in the acquisition of novel action-related words.", "pages": "505-18"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "9341719", "authors": ["Benninger, DH", "Lomarev, M", "Lopez, G", "Wassermann, EM", "Li, X", "Considine, E", "Hallett, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by motor deficits which eventually respond less to dopaminergic therapy and thus pose a therapeutic challenge.
