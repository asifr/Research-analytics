The aim of this study was to investigate the role of current strength on the ability of anodal tDCS to improve WM, and secondly to investigate the time course of effects. Twelve healthy participants underwent three stimulation sessions consisting of 20\u2009min of either 1\u2009mA anodal tDCS, 2\u2009mA anodal tDCS, or sham tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) localized via F3, all whilst completing a WM task. Intra-stimulation and post-stimulation WM performances were measured using the n-back and Sternberg tasks respectively. Results revealed no significant improvements in participants' accuracy, but a significant interaction was found with respect to current strength and time for accurate reaction time. The finding provides partial support for the hypothesis, in that it appears current strength may affect aspects of WM performance. However, more research is needed, and a higher difficulty level of WM tasks is one of the suggestions discussed for future research.", "pages": "45"}, {"volume": "259", "title": "Treatment of chronic tinnitus with repeated sessions of prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation: outcomes from an open-label pilot study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17300756", "authors": ["Frank, E", "Schecklmann, M", "Landgrebe, M", "Burger, J", "Kreuzer, P", "Poeppl, TB", "Kleinjung, T", "Hajak, G", "Langguth, B"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an environmental sound source. Abnormal activity in central auditory pathways is considered as the neuronal correlate of tinnitus. However, there is increasing evidence from neuroimaging studies for an additional involvement of the frontal cortex in the pathophysiology of tinnitus, especially concerning its attentional and emotional aspects. Recently, in a subgroup of tinnitus patients, temporary reduction of tinnitus intensity and tinnitus-related distress has been reported after bifrontal tDCS with the anode over the right and the cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated application of bifrontal tDCS results in longer-lasting reduction of tinnitus and may represent a potential treatment approach. Thirty-two patients with chronic and treatment-resistant tinnitus received six sessions of bifrontal tDCS (1.5 mA, 30 min, two sessions per week) with the anode over the right and the cathode over the left DLPFC. Treatment outcome was assessed with several standardized tinnitus questionnaires, numeric rating scales, and a depression scale. In the entire group, beneficial effects of bifrontal tDCS on tinnitus were found for numeric rating scores of loudness, unpleasantness, and discomfort, but not in tinnitus or depression scales. Exploratory analysis revealed an effect of gender on treatment effects with female patients demonstrating a better response in several scores. Our open-label pilot study suggests some beneficial effect of bifrontal tDCS (anode right and cathode left) in the treatment of severe tinnitus, warranting further controlled studies.", "pages": "45"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Neurophysiological and behavioral effects of tDCS combined with constraint-induced movement therapy in poststroke patients.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "18667101", "authors": ["Bolognini, N", "Vallar, G", "Casati, C", "Latif, LA", "El-Nazer, R", "Williams, J", "Banco, E", "Macea, DD", "Tesio, L", "Chessa, C", "Fregni, F"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurorehabilitation and neural repair", "abstract": "Recovery of motor function after stroke may depend on a balance of activity in the neural network involving the affected and the unaffected motor cortices.", "pages": "45"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation modulates tinnitus intensity and tinnitus-distress-related brain activity.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20368742", "authors": ["Vanneste, S", "De Ridder, D"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "To assess whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase the training-induced recovery of motor functions.", "pages": "45"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Effects of simultaneous bilateral tDCS of the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "20633386", "authors": ["Mordillo-Mateos, L", "Turpin-Fenoll, L", "Mill\u00e1n-Pascual, J", "N\u00fa\u00f1ez-P\u00e9rez, N", "Panyavin, I", "G\u00f3mez-Arg\u00fcelles, JM", "Botia-Paniagua, E", "Foffani, G", "Lang, N", "Oliviero, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "In an exploratory study, 14 patients with chronic stroke and mean Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Assessment of 29 (range = 8-50) entered a double-blind sham-controlled study, aimed to investigate neurophysiological and behavioral effects of bihemispheric tDCS (cathodal stimulation of the unaffected motor cortex and anodal stimulation of the affected motor cortex), combined with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).", "pages": "45"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Auditory event-related potentials (P3) and cognitive changes induced by frontal direct current stimulation in alcoholics according to Lesch alcoholism typology.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "21511208", "authors": ["Nakamura-Palacios, EM", "de Almeida Benevides, MC", "da Penha Zago-Gomes, M", "de Oliveira, RW", "de Vasconcellos, VF", "de Castro, LN", "da Silva, MC", "Ramos, PA", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)", "abstract": "Patients in both groups demonstrated gains on primary outcome measures, that is, Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test, Handgrip Strength, Motor Activity Log Scale, and Fugl-Meyer Motor Score.
