Participants performed a contrast detection task on two consecutive days. Each session consisted of a baseline measurement followed by measurements made during active or sham stimulation. On the first day, one group received anodal stimulation to primary visual cortex (V1), while another received cathodal stimulation. Stimulation polarity was reversed for these groups on the second day. The third (control) group of subjects received sham stimulation on both days. No improvements or decrements in contrast sensitivity relative to the same-day baseline were observed during real tDCS, nor was any within-session learning trend observed. However, task performance improved significantly from Day 1 to Day 2 for the participants who received cathodal tDCS on Day 1 and for the sham group. No such improvement was found for the participants who received anodal stimulation on Day 1, indicating that anodal tDCS blocked overnight consolidation of visual learning, perhaps through engagement of inhibitory homeostatic plasticity mechanisms or alteration of the signal-to-noise ratio within stimulated cortex. These results show that applying tDCS to the visual cortex can modify consolidation of visual learning.", "pages": "1234-9"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation affects seizures and cognition in fully amygdala-kindled rats.", "keywords": ["chronic post-traumatic headache", "migraine", "tDCS", "tension-type headache", "treatment of headache"], "issue": "6", "pmid": "23562065", "authors": ["Kamida, T", "Kong, S", "Eshima, N", "Fujiki, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a new non-invasive brain stimulation technique, on amygdala-kindled rats. The seizure severity, i.e. seizure stage, afterdischarge duration (ADD), and AD threshold (ADT) in the animals were measured one day after the last cathodal tDCS session, comparing with those of pre-treatment controls. Furthermore, the effects of cathodal tDCS on cognitive function were also studied by a water maze test (WMT) two days after the last tDCS session. Cathodal tDCS treatment significantly improved the seizure stage and decreased ADD together with elevated ADT one day after the last tDCS session. The treatment also showed significant improvement in the performance of WMT. The findings suggest that cathodal tDCS has anticonvulsive after-effects last at least for one day on the amygdala-kindled rats and positively affects cognitive performance.", "pages": "1234-9"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Impaired motor cortex responses in non-psychotic first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients: a cathodal tDCS pilot study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "23545473", "authors": ["Hasan, A", "Misewitsch, K", "Nitsche, MA", "Gruber, O", "Padberg, F", "Falkai, P", "Wobrock, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Schizophrenia has recently been described as a disorder of impaired plasticity and dysconnectivity.
