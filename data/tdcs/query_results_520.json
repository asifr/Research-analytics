Noninvasive cortical stimulations using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are less invasive when delivering the electrical current to the patient's brain, but have several limitations. Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) using an implantable stimulation system consisting of epidurally or subdurally placed electrodes and pulse generators, provides cortical stimulation and concurrent rehabilitative training in a stable fashion without limiting a patient's activities. The effectiveness of these two types of DCS--epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) and subdural cortical stimulation (SCS)--has not been compared. In this work, a computer simulation study was conducted to predict the current density distributions (CDD) through cortical stimulations using subdurally or epidurally placed electrodes. The simulation study is based on the human motor cortex model with a three-dimensional finite element model (FEM). The change in CDD depending on the shape of the electrode (disc or ring) is discussed. The output current induced by SCS was about four times larger than that of ECS when voltage stimulations with the same magnitude were regulated. Thus, SCS showed substantially better penetration of the current into gray or white matter. Further, the ring electrode performed comparably or slightly inferior to the disc electrode in both cortical stimulations.", "pages": "7226-9"}, {"volume": "2011", "title": "On handling the layered structure of the skull in transcranial direct current stimulation models.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22254724", "authors": ["Rampersad, S", "Stegeman, D", "Oostendorp, T"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

We employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, current intensity: 80 \u03bcA, and 40 \u03bcA; anodal electrode area: 3.14 mm(2); stimulation time: 30 minutes) over the M1 area to relieve the ipsilateral bias in the rat model. A corridor test was set to count the ipsilateral bias of the rats. In this experiment, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats (80 \u03bcA: n = 8, 40 \u03bcA: n = 8, sham: n = 7, healthy control: n = 7) were chosen for the corridor test and the tDCS session. The lesioned rats exhibited increased ipsilateral bias 4 weeks after the lesion surgery (P < 0.01), and the anodal tDCS with the active electrode on the lesioned side relieved the ipsilateral bias significantly (P < 0.01) immediately after the surgery and the improvement lasted for nearly 1 day. The rats in the group of 80 \u03bcA exhibited more significant changes than the 40 \u03bcA group after one day. After all the experiments, the histological process showed no neurotrauma led by the tDCS. In conclusion, the modulatory function of the cortical excitability of the tDCS may awaken the compensatory mechanisms and the response mechanisms which modulate the loss of the brain function. Further studies should be done to provide more evidence about the assumption.", "pages": "7226-9"}, {"volume": "42", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in the treatment of major depression: a meta-analysis.", "keywords": [], "issue": "9", "pmid": "22236735", "authors": ["Kalu, UG", "Sexton, CE", "Loo, CK", "Ebmeier, KP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Psychological medicine", "abstract": "So far, no comprehensive answer has emerged to the question of whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can make a clinically useful contribution to the treatment of major depression.

Recent studies suggest that the after-effects of tDCS are related to molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here we investigated the effect of DCS on the induction of one of the most studied N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic activity at CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. We show that DCS applied to rat brain slices determines a modulation of LTP that is increased by anodal and reduced by cathodal DCS. Immediate early genes, such as c-fos and zif268 (egr1/NGFI-A/krox24), are rapidly induced following neuronal activation, and a specific role of zif268 in the induction and maintenance of LTP has been demonstrated. We found that both anodal and cathodal DCS produce a marked subregion-specific increase in the expression of zif268 protein in the cornus ammonis (CA) region, whereas the same protocols of stimulation produce a less pronounced increase in c-fos protein expression in the CA and in dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression was also investigated, and it was found to be reduced in cathodal-stimulated slices. The present data demonstrate that it is possible to modulate LTP by using DCS and provide the rationale for the use of DCS in neurological diseases to promote the adaptive and suppress the maladaptive forms of brain plasticity.", "pages": "7226-9"}, {"volume": "200", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation for depression: 3-week, randomised, sham-controlled trial.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "22219028", "authors": ["Loo, CK", "Alonzo, A", "Martin, D", "Mitchell, PB", "Galvez, V", "Sachdev, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuroimaging data have revealed bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) involvement during verbal n-back working memory (WM). In this task as n (i.e., WM load) increases, subjects show poorer behavioral performance as well as greater activation of this brain area. Moreover, there is evidence that a brief period of practice or even increased familiarity with the task can improve WM performance and lead to activation changes in the PPC. The aim of this study was to investigate, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the effects on WM load performance induced by different PPC modulation after increased familiarity with the task. After a short practice, we tested verbal WM using an n-back task (1-back vs. 2-back) before and after the application of bilateral tDCS over PPCs (left anodal-right cathodal, left cathodal-right anodal or sham). ANOVA showed a significant interaction between tDCS and task. In the 1-back task, left anodal-right cathodal modulation abolished improvement in reaction times observed in the other two modulation conditions. Conversely, in the 2-back task the same effect was observed after left cathodal-right anodal modulation relative to the other two modulation conditions. This double dissociation demonstrates either a differential engagement of each PPC or changes in the interhemispheric balance of activity across this brain region. Neuroimaging studies show parametric activation of the PPC as difficulty increases, but activation does not switch sides. Thus, our observed effects cannot be attributed to increased task difficulty, the stimuli used, or the response requirements. Rather, we suggest that these findings reflect the use of different processing strategies to perform these two tasks. In conclusion, after increased familiarity with the task, different tDCS modulations lead to changes in a task-related region depending on differences in processing strategies in 1-back vs. 2-back.", "pages": "7226-9"}, {"volume": "200", "title": "Transcranial stimulation in depression.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "14244793", "authors": ["Allan, C", "Kalu, UG", "Sexton, CE", "Ebmeier, KP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science", "abstract": "REM sleep is a unique brain state characterized by frontal deactivation alongside activation of the posterior association and limbic cortices. Human brain lesion studies have found that the loss of dreaming is characterized by damage to the frontal and posterior parieto-temporo-occipital association cortex. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the function of these brain regions might encapsulate the neural processes of dreaming. The aim of the following two experiments was to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs), applied simultaneously to the frontal and right posterior parietal cortex during Stage 2 sleep, on dreaming. In Experiment 1, 17 healthy participants received tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) and low-intensity tDCs as well as no tDCs (blank control) during Stage 2 sleep in a counterbalanced order across the night. Dream reports were collected upon awakening after each of the three conditions. In Experiment 2, 10 participants received tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal), no tDCs (blank control) and two additional control conditions (reversed polarity and other-cephalic tDCs). In both experiments a significantly greater number of imagery reports were found on awakening after tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal), compared to the blank control conditions. However, in Experiment 2 the frequency of imagery reports from the tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) was not significantly different from the other two tDC conditions, suggesting a non-specific effect of tDCs. Overall, it was concluded that tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) increased the frequency of dream reports with visual imagery, possibly via a general arousing effect and/or recreating specific cortical neural activity involved in dreaming.", "pages": "7226-9"}]
