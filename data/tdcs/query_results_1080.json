Previous studies in the anesthetized macaque monkey suggested that, compared with the cat, the transmission of such excitation via a system of C3-C4 propriospinal neurons may be relatively weak. However, it is possible that in the anesthetized preparation, propriospinal transmission of cortical inputs to motoneurons may be depressed. To address this issue, the current study investigated the responses of single motor units (SMUs) to corticospinal inputs in either awake (n = 1) or lightly sedated (n = 3) macaque monkeys. Recordings in the awake state were made during performance of a precision grip task. The responses of spontaneously discharging SMUs to electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract (PT) via chronically implanted electrodes were examined for evidence of non-monosynaptic, presumed propriospinal, effects. Single PT stimuli (up to 250 microA; duration, 0.2 ms, 2 Hz) were delivered during steady discharge of the SMU (10-30 imp/s). SMUs were recorded from muscles acting on the thumb (adductor pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis, n = 18), wrist (extensor carpi radialis, n = 29) and elbow (biceps, n = 9). In all SMUs, the poststimulus time histograms to PT stimulation consisted of a single peak at a fixed latency and with a brief duration [0.74 +/- 0.25 (SD) ms, n = 56], consistent with the responses being mediated by monosynaptic action of cortico-motoneuronal (CM) impulses. Later peaks, indicating non-monosynaptic action, were not present even when the probability of the initial peak response was low and when there was no evidence for suppression of ongoing SMU activity following this peak (n = 20 SMUs). Even when repetitive (double-pulse) PT stimuli were used to facilitate transmission through oligosynaptic linkages, no later peaks were observed (16 SMUs). In some thumb muscle SMUs (n = 8), responses to PT stimulation were compared with those evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation, using a figure-eight coil held over the motor cortex. Responses varied according the orientation of the coil: in the latero-medial position, single peak responses similar to those from the PT were obtained; their latencies confirmed direct excitation of CM cells, and there were no later peaks. In the posterio-anterior orientation, responses had longer latencies and consisted of two to three subpeaks. At least under the conditions that we have tested, the results provide no positive evidence for transmission of cortical excitation to upper limb motoneurons by non-monosynaptic pathways in the macaque monkey.", "pages": "1899-901"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Regional modulation of BOLD MRI responses to human sensorimotor activation by transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "11180425", "authors": ["Baudewig, J", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Frahm, J"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine : official journal of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine / Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine", "abstract": "Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI was used to monitor modulations of human sensorimotor activity by prior transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

Cathodal tDCS resulted in a global decrease of the mean number of activated pixels by 38% (P < 0.01) 0-5 min after stimulation, which reduced to 28% (P < 0.05) 15-20 min after stimulation. A region-of-interest analysis revealed a 57% decrease of activated pixels (P < 0.001) in the supplementary motor area, but no change in the hand area of the primary motor cortex. Anodal tDCS yielded a nonsignificant 5% increase of activated pixels with no regional differences. These findings support the view that reduced neuroaxonal excitability after cathodal tDCS causes reduced brain activity. However, rather than affecting the primary sensorimotor input of an active task, the process appears to dampen those responses that rely on cortico-cortical connections and related processing.

Excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. By varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after-effects could be controlled. The effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. Functional alterations related to post-tetanic potentiation, short-term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation.

The current fads resemble those at the end of the last century, when many were falsely touting the benefits of direct electrical and weak magnetic stimulation. Yet in the midst of this popular interest in magnetic therapy, a new neuroscience field has developed that uses powerful magnetic fields to alter brain activity--transcranial magnetic stimulation. This review examines the basic principles underlying transcranial magnetic stimulation, and describes how it differs from electrical stimulation or other uses of magnets. Initial studies in this field are critically summarized, particularly as they pertain to the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

The stimulus intensities of conditioning and test stimuli were 80% and 130-140% of the threshold intensity, respectively.

In seven normal subjects, subthreshold transcranial magnetic conditioning stimuli (using a figure-of-eight coil) were applied over the motor cortex in order to evoke activity in intracortical neuronal circuits. The net effect on cortical excitability was evaluated by measuring the effect on the size of EMG responses elicited in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle by a subsequent suprathreshold test stimulus. 2. A single conditioning stimulus suppressed the size of the test response at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-4 ms whereas the response was facilitated at ISIs of 6-20 ms. The facilitation could be augmented if pairs of conditioning stimuli were given. 3. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to have separate mechanisms. The threshold for inhibition (0.7 active motor threshold) was slightly lower than that for facilitation (0.8 active threshold). Similarly, the inhibitory effect was independent of the direction of current flow induced in the cortex by the conditioning shock, whereas facilitation was maximal with posterior-anterior currents and minimal with lateromedial current. 4. Direct corticospinal effects were probably not responsible for the results since facilitation of cortical test responses could be produced by conditioning stimuli which had no effect on the amplitude of H reflexes elicited in active ADM muscle. 5. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to interact in a roughly linear manner, consistent with separate inputs to a common neurone. 6.

However, SPECT and PET, the technologies most commonly used in these studies, are of limited value for assessment of the dynamics of cerebral blood flow changes at different states of functional brain activity. The introduction of transcranial Doppler sonography and the extended application of stimuli presentation and perception have now been added to the investigator's armamentarium. Simple sensory stimulation (visual, acoustic and tactile) and complex mental tasks (viewing of complex pictures, tactile differentiation of objects) changed the blood flow velocity in the basal intracranial arteries. These changes corresponded to the current concepts of functional cortical organization. The magnitude of the flow velocity increases upon visual stimulation was dependent on the complexity of the stimuli used, and was up to 38% in our studies. The introduction of continuous and bilateral simultaneous Doppler recordings, the calculation of mean flow velocity from cardiac cycle to cardiac cycle and a specially designed averaging method for data analysis allowed effective elimination of non-specific influences and made it possible to demonstrate rapid changes of perfusion in both middle cerebral artery territories in direct response to hemisphere-specific tasks. These changes were correlated with known functional cerebral asymmetries. A language task, for instance, was associated with a significantly larger flow velocity increase in the middle cerebral artery of the dominant hemisphere than in the corresponding artery of the non-dominant hemisphere (5.2 +/- 1,8% vs 3.0 +/- 1.8%, p < 0.001). The excellent time resolution of this technology made it possible to record hemodynamic changes taking place in response to modifications of neuronal activity within less than 1 s. The shortest time interval between stimulus presentation and the first significant increase in flow velocity was on average 717 +/- 191 ms. The latency of less than 1 s suggest that the coupling between alterations of neuronal activity and the regional cerebral blood flow response is mediated by an remarkably rapid mechanism.", "pages": "1899-901"}]
