SETTING:: Inpatient and outpatient neurorehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS:: Twenty-three adult patients, 4- to 92- months post severe TBI. DESIGN:: Participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups. The experimental group received A-tDCS (10 minutes; 1 mA; in the DLPFC), followed by rehabilitative cognitive training, daily for 15 days. Controls received A-tDCS for 25 seconds (sham condition) with the same rehabilitation. MAIN MEASURES:: Battery of memory and attention tests, which included visual and auditory modalities. Participants were tested twice before beginning rehabilitation (to control for spontaneous recovery), after rehabilitation completion, and 4 months later. RESULTS:: Tests scores in both groups were similar at 3 weeks before and immediately before treatment. After treatment, the experimental group exhibited larger effect sizes in 6 of 8 cognitive outcome measures, but they were not significantly different from controls. At follow-up, differences remained insignificant. CONCLUSION:: In contrast to previous studies, our study did not provide sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of repeated A-tDCS for enhancing rehabilitation of memory and attention in patients after severe TBI.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Noninvasive remote activation of the ventral midbrain by transcranial direct current stimulation of prefrontal cortex.", "keywords": ["Cognitive enhancement", "Healthy controls", "Prefrontal cortex", "Transcranial direct current stimulation", "Working memory"], "issue": "", "pmid": "23756377", "authors": ["Chib, VS", "Yun, K", "Takahashi, H", "Shimojo, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Translational psychiatry", "abstract": "The midbrain lies deep within the brain and has an important role in reward, motivation, movement and the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression and addiction. To date, the primary means of acting on this region has been with pharmacological interventions or implanted electrodes. Here we introduce a new noninvasive brain stimulation technique that exploits the highly interconnected nature of the midbrain and prefrontal cortex to stimulate deep brain regions. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the prefrontal cortex, we were able to remotely activate the interconnected midbrain and cause increases in participants' appraisals of facial attractiveness. Participants with more enhanced prefrontal/midbrain connectivity following stimulation exhibited greater increases in attractiveness ratings. These results illustrate that noninvasive direct stimulation of prefrontal cortex can induce neural activity in the distally connected midbrain, which directly effects behavior. Furthermore, these results suggest that this tDCS protocol could provide a promising approach to modulate midbrain functions that are disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "76", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation changes human endowment effect.", "keywords": ["Electrical Stimulation of the Brain", "Enhancement", "Neuroethics", "Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "Regulation"], "issue": "4", "pmid": "11459878", "authors": ["Votinov, M", "Aso, T", "Koganemaru, S", "Fukuyama, H", "Mima, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuroscience research", "abstract": "To test whether the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) plays role in the endowment effect, we investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right IFG on the willingness to accept/willingness to pay (WTA/WTP) discrepancy. Twelve healthy subjects underwent anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS on separate days. Stimulation was applied over the right IFG for 20min at 2mA. Subjects participated in the pricing task where they evaluated the presented items under WTA and WTP framings during tDCS intervention. The results showed that the WTA/WTP ratio after anodal tDCS was significantly higher than that after cathodal one. In addition, we found that the reaction time during the cathodal tDCS condition was significantly longer compared to those during anodal or sham tDCS conditions.

In particular, there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that anodal tDCS applied to the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to enhance aspects of cognitive functioning, in particular working memory (WM). This has led to both excitement and concerns regarding the possibility of 'electrodoping' in order to greatly improve one's cognitive performance. We investigated the behavioural and neurophysiological effects of increasing the current (or 'dose') of tDCS on the degree of WM improvement in healthy controls. Single sessions of 1 mA, 2 mA and sham anodal tDCS to the left PFC were undertaken over a period of three weeks. Participants underwent a WM task at three time points post-stimulation (0, 20 and 40 min) with concurrent electrophysiological (EEG) recordings. Our results showed that while active tDCS can enhance behavioural performance, with neurophysiological findings indicating improve efficiency of cognitive processing; we showed that 1 mA produced the most significant effects. These findings are somewhat unexpected as tDCS dose effects in cognitive enhancement have been shown previously in patient populations. Our results provide valuable information regarding the potential limits of tDCS induced cognitive enhancement in healthy controls, as well as providing additional insights into the possible mechanisms of action of tDCS.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Therapeutic effects of non-invasive brain stimulation with direct currents (tDCS) in neuropsychiatric diseases.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "11528428", "authors": ["Kuo, MF", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Neuroplasticity, which is the dynamic structural and functional reorganization of central nervous system connectivity due to environmental and internal demands, is recognized as a major physiological basis for adaption of cognition, and behavior, and thus of utmost importance for normal brain function. Pathological alterations of plasticity are increasingly explored as pathophysiological foundation of diverse neurological and psychiatric diseases. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are able to induce and modulate neuroplasticity in humans. Therefore, they have potential to alter pathological plasticity on the one hand, and foster physiological plasticity on the other, in neuropsychiatric diseases to reduce symptoms, and enhance rehabilitation. tDCS is an emerging NIBS tool, which induces glutamatergic plasticity via application of relatively weak currents through the scalp in humans. In the last years its efficacy to treat neuropsychiatric diseases has been explored increasingly. In this review, we will give an overview of pathological alterations of plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, gather clinical studies involving tDCS to ameliorate symptoms, and discuss future directions of application, with an emphasis on optimizing stimulation effects.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Ethics of the Electrified Mind: Defining Issues and Perspectives on the Principled Use of Brain Stimulation in Medical Research and Clinical Care.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "11709163", "authors": ["Cabrera, LY", "Evans, EL", "Hamilton, RH"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain topography", "abstract": "In recent years, non-pharmacologic approaches to modifying human neural activity have gained increasing attention.

Hence, although brain stimulation techniques offer considerable benefits to society, they also raise a number of ethical concerns. In this paper we will address various dilemmas related to brain stimulation in the context of clinical practice and biomedical research.
