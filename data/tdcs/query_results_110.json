We hypothesized that tDCS over the supplementary motor area (SMA), a region that is known to be involved in the control of multi-joint whole body movements, will result in polarity specific changes in DBT learning. In a randomized sham-controlled, double-blinded parallel design, we applied 20 min of tDCS over the supplementary motor area (SMA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) while subjects performed a DBT. Anodal tDCS over SMA with the cathode placed over contralateral PFC impaired motor skill learning of the DBT compared to sham. This effect was still present on the second day of training. Reversing the polarity (cathode over SMA, anode over PFC) did not affect motor skill learning neither on the first nor on the second day of training. To better disentangle whether the impaired motor skill learning was due to a modulation of SMA or PFC, we performed an additional control experiment. Here, we applied anodal tDCS over SMA together with a larger and presumably more ineffective electrode (cathode) over PFC. Interestingly this alternative tDCS electrode setup did not affect the outcome of DBT learning. Our results provide novel evidence that a modulation of the (right) PFC seems to impair complex multi-joint motor skill learning. Hence, future studies should take the positioning of both tDCS electrodes into account when investigating complex motor skill learning.", "pages": "76-80"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Battery powered thought: Enhancement of attention, learning, and memory in healthy adults using transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": ["Brain stimulation", "Cognition", "Neuroenhancement"], "issue": "", "pmid": "23933040", "authors": ["Coffman, BA", "Clark, VP", "Parasuraman, R"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "This article reviews studies demonstrating enhancement with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of attention, learning, and memory processes in healthy adults. Given that these are fundamental cognitive functions, they may also mediate stimulation effects on other higher-order processes such as decision-making and problem solving. Although tDCS research is still young, there have been a variety of methods used and cognitive processes tested. While these different methods have resulted in seemingly contradictory results among studies, many consistent and noteworthy effects of tDCS on attention, learning, and memory have been reported. The literature suggests that although tDCS as typically applied may not be as useful for localization of function in the brain as some other methods of brain stimulation, tDCS may be particularly well-suited for practical applications involving the enhancement of attention, learning, and memory, in both healthy subjects and in clinical populations.", "pages": "76-80"}, {"volume": "189", "title": "Transcranial direct-current stimulation reduced the excitability of diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways whatever the polarity used.", "keywords": ["Diaphragm", "corticospinal pathways", "motor evoked potentials", "neuromodulation"], "issue": "1", "pmid": "23933029", "authors": ["Azabou, E", "Roche, N", "Sharshar, T", "Bussel, B", "Lofaso, F", "Petitjean, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Respiratory physiology & neurobiology", "abstract": "We investigated effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on the diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways in healthy human. Anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS were randomly applied upon the left diaphragmatic motor cortex in twelve healthy right-handed men. Corticospinal pathways excitability was assessed by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicited motor-evoked-potential (MEP). For each tDCS condition, MEPs were recorded before (Pre) tDCS then after 10 min (Post1, at tDCS discontinuation in the anodal and cathodal sessions) and 20 min (Post2). As result, both anodal and cathodal tDCS significantly decreased MEP amplitude of the right hemidiaphragm at both Post1 and Post2, versus Pre. MEP amplitude was unchanged versus Pre during the sham condition. The effects of cathodal and anodal tDCS applied to the diaphragm motor cortex differ from those observed during tDCS of the limb motor cortex.

However, all tDCS studies have previously investigated the effects using unihemisperic stimulation. No reports to date have examined the role of bihemispheric tDCS on aphasia recovery. Here, eight aphasic persons with apraxia of speech underwent intensive language therapy in two different conditions: real bihemispheric anodic ipsilesional stimulation over the left Broca's area and cathodic contralesional stimulation over the right homologue of Broca's area, and a sham condition. In both conditions, patients underwent concurrent language therapy for their apraxia of speech. The language treatment lasted 10\u00a0days (Monday to Friday, then weekend off, then Monday to Friday). There was a 14-day intersession interval between the real and the sham conditions. In all patients, language measures were collected before (T0), at the end of (T10) and 1\u00a0week after the end of (F/U) treatment. Results showed that after simultaneous excitatory stimulation to the left frontal hemisphere and inhibitory stimulation to the right frontal hemisphere regions, patients exhibited a significant recovery not only in terms of better accuracy and speed in articulating the treated stimuli but also in other language tasks (picture description, noun and verb naming, word repetition, word reading) which persisted in the follow-up session. Taken together, these data suggest that bihemispheric anodic ipsilesional and cathodic contralesional stimulation in chronic aphasia patients may affect the treated function, resulting in a positive influence on different language tasks.", "pages": "76-80"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Bihemispheric stimulation over left and right inferior frontal region enhances recovery from apraxia of speech in chronic aphasia.", "keywords": ["Addiction", "Craving", "DLPFC", "Direct current stimulation", "Non-invasive neurostimulation", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation", "rTMS", "tDCS"], "issue": "9", "pmid": "23930827", "authors": ["Marangolo, P", "Fiori, V", "Cipollari, S", "Campana, S", "Razzano, C", "Di Paola, M", "Koch, G", "Caltagirone, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the available evidence regarding the effects of non-invasive neurostimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), on craving in substance dependence and craving for high palatable food.

A total of 17 eligible studies were identified. Random effects analysis revealed a pooled standardized effect size (Hedge's g) of 0.476 (CI: 0.316-0.636), indicating a medium effect size favouring active non-invasive neurostimulation over sham stimulation in the reduction of craving (z=5.832, p<0.001).

High-density electroencephalography was used to define the spatial diffusion of tDCS after effects. Ten healthy subjects performed a finger tapping task with the right hand before and after three separate sessions of 20 minutes of Sham, AtDCS or CtDCS over left primary motor cortex (M1). During movement, we found an increment of low alpha band Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in bilateral central, frontal areas and in the left inferior parietal region, as well as an increment of beta ERD in fronto-central and parieto-occipital regions, after AtDCs compared to Sham and CtDCS. In the rest pre-movement period, after Sham as well as AtDCS, we documented an increment of low alpha band power over the course of pre- and post-stimulation recording sessions, localized in the sensorimotor and parieto-occipital regions. On the contrary, after CtDCS no increment of low alpha power was found. Finally beta band coherence among signals from left sensorimotor cortex and activity of bilateral parietal, occipital and right frontal regions was higher after AtDCS compared with Sham condition. Similarly, theta coherence with parietal and frontal regions was enhanced after AtDCS. We hypothesize that the local modulation of membrane polarization, as well as long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1, could result in changes of both local band power and functional architecture of the motor network.

Body rotation was labeled as ipsilateral or contralateral to the anode side, but no difference was observed depending on the direction of rotation or hemisphere polarity. Threshold increase during tDCS was greater for VOR than for motion perception. 'Sham' stimulation had no effect on thresholds.
