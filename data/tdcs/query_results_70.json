Recently it was shown that applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over SMA affected participants' ability to inhibit their movement in a stop-signal reaction time task (Hsu et al. [11]). Of interest in the current study was whether modulating SMA excitability using tDCS would have similar effects in an anticipation-timing stop-signal task. Participants performed 2 sessions each consisting of a pre- and post-tDCS block of 160 trials in which they were instructed to extend their wrist concurrently with the arrival of a pointer to a target (i.e., a clock hand reaching a set position). In 20% of trials (stop trials) the pointer stopped 80, 110, 140, 170, or 200ms prior to the target, and on these trials participants were instructed to inhibit their movement if possible. Anodal and cathodal tDCS (separated by at least 48h) was applied for each participant between the pre- and post-tDCS blocks. No change in the proportion of successfully inhibited movements on stop trials was found following cathodal tDCS (p>.05). However, anodal tDCS resulted in a decreased proportion of successfully inhibited movements on stop trials (p=002), and an earlier movement onset on control trials (p<.01). This suggests that the SMA may be more involved in initiation than in inhibition of anticipatory movements. Furthermore these data suggest that differences in initiation and inhibitory processes exist between stop-signal reaction time and anticipation-timing stop-signal tasks.", "pages": "208-14"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Enhancing verbal episodic memory in older and young subjects after non-invasive brain stimulation.", "keywords": ["aging", "dorsolateral prefrontal cortex", "parietal cortex", "tDCS", "verbal retrieval"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24062685", "authors": ["Manenti, R", "Brambilla, M", "Petesi, M", "Ferrari, C", "Cotelli, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "abstract": "Memory is the capacity to store, maintain, and retrieve events or information from the mind. Difficulties in verbal episodic memory commonly occur in healthy aging. In this paper, we assess the hypothesis that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or over the parietal cortex (PARC) could facilitate verbal episodic memory in a group of 32 healthy older adults and in a group of 32 young subjects relative to a sham stimulation using a single-blind randomized controlled design. Each participant underwent two sessions of anodal tDCS (left and right) and one session of sham stimulation. Overall, our results demonstrated that, in young and in older subjects, anodal tDCS applied during the retrieval phase facilitates verbal episodic memory. In particular, we found that tDCS applied over the left and right regions (DLPFC and PARC) induced better performance in young participants; only tDCS applied over the left regions (DLPFC and PARC) increased retrieval in older subjects. These results suggest that anodal tDCS can be a relevant tool to modulate the long-term episodic memory capacities of young and older subjects.", "pages": "208-14"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Modulation of cortical-subcortical networks in Parkinson's disease by applied field effects.", "keywords": ["Parkinson\u2019s disease", "field effects", "transcranial alternating current stimulation", "transcranial direct current stimulation", "transcranial electrical stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24062667", "authors": ["Hess, CW"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Studies suggest that endogenous field effects may play a role in neuronal oscillations and communication. Non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation with low-intensity currents can also have direct effects on the underlying cortex as well as distant network effects. While Parkinson's disease (PD) is amenable to invasive neuromodulation in the basal ganglia by deep brain stimulation (DBS), techniques of non-invasive neuromodulation like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are being investigated as possible therapies. tDCS and tACS have the potential to influence the abnormal cortical-subcortical network activity that occurs in PD through sub-threshold changes in cortical excitability or through entrainment or disruption of ongoing rhythmic cortical activity. This may allow for the targeting of specific features of the disease involving abnormal oscillatory activity, as well as the enhancement of potential cortical compensation for basal ganglia dysfunction and modulation of cortical plasticity in neurorehabilitation. However, little is currently known about how cortical stimulation will affect subcortical structures, the size of any effect, and the factors of stimulation that will influence these effects.", "pages": "208-14"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "What the online manipulation of linguistic activity can tell us about language and thought.", "keywords": ["labeling", "language and thought", "linguistic relativity", "transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)", "verbal interference"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24062653", "authors": ["Perry, LK", "Lupyan, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising therapy for major depression treatment, although little is known of its effects in ameliorating distinct symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important, not only to increase knowledge of its antidepressant mechanisms, but also to guide its potential use in clinical practice. Using data from a recent factorial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial applying tDCS-alone and combined with sertraline to treat 120 depressed outpatients over 6\u00a0wk (Brunoni et al., 2013), we investigated the pattern of improvement in symptoms of depression from the Montgomery-Asberg depression scale (MADRS). First, we performed one multivariate analysis of variance with the score improvement of the 10 MADRS items as dependent variables. Significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) results were further explored with follow-up analyses of variance. TDCS (alone and combined with sertraline) improved concentration difficulties and pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. The combined treatment also improved apparent and reported sadness, lassitude and inability to feel. Indeed, tDCS/sertraline significantly ameliorated all but the 'vegetative' depression symptoms (inner tension, sleep and appetite items). We further discuss whether bifrontal tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could be associated with improvement in cognitive (concentration) and affective (pessimistic/suicidal thoughts) processing, while the combined treatment might have a more widespread antidepressant effect by simultaneously acting on different depression pathways. We also identified patterns of antidepressant improvement for tDCS that might aid in tailoring specific interventions for different subtypes of depressed patients, e.g. particularly those with suicidal ideation.", "pages": "208-14"}, {"volume": "150", "title": "Prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) changes negative symptoms and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in a single case of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.", "keywords": ["Event-related potentials (ERP)", "Mismatch negativity (MMN)", "Neuroplasticity", "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"], "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "24060570", "authors": ["Palm, U", "Keeser, D", "Blautzik, J", "Pogarell, O", "Ertl-Wagner, B", "Kupka, MJ", "Reiser, M", "Padberg, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Schizophrenia research", "abstract": "To evaluate the influence of frontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on auditory mismatch negativity (MMN).", "pages": "208-14"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Differential improvement in depressive symptoms for tDCS alone and combined with pharmacotherapy: an exploratory analysis from The Sertraline Vs.
