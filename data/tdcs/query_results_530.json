In the present work we combined two techniques able to produce short-term (5-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS) and long-term (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) effects on corticospinal excitability to evaluate whether and how the effects of 5-Hz rTMS can be tuned by tDCS preconditioning. Twelve healthy subjects participated in the study. Brief trains of 5-Hz rTMS were applied to the primary motor cortex at an intensity of 120% of the resting motor threshold, with recording of the electromyograph traces evoked by each stimulus of the train from the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis muscle. This interventional protocol was preconditioned by 15 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS delivered at 1.5 mA intensity. Our results showed that motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) increased significantly in size during trains of 5-Hz rTMS in the absence of tDCS preconditioning. After facilitatory preconditioning with anodal tDCS, 5-Hz rTMS failed to produce progressive MEP facilitation. Conversely, when 5-Hz rTMS was preceded by inhibitory cathodal tDCS, MEP facilitation was not abolished. These findings may give insight into the mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity in the human cerebral cortex, suggesting also more suitable applications of tDCS in a clinical setting.", "pages": "119-24"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Modulation of untruthful responses with non-invasive brain stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "23550273", "authors": ["Fecteau, S", "Boggio, P", "Fregni, F", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "abstract": "Deceptive abilities have long been studied in relation to personality traits. More recently, studies explored the neural substrates associated with deceptive skills suggesting a critical role of the prefrontal cortex. Here we investigated whether non-invasive brain stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could modulate generation of untruthful responses about subject's personal life across contexts (i.e., deceiving on guilt-free questions on daily activities; generating previously memorized lies about past experience; and producing spontaneous lies about past experience), as well as across modality responses (verbal and motor responses). Results reveal that real, but not sham, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the DLPFC can reduce response latency for untruthful over truthful answers across contexts and modality responses. Also, contexts of lies seem to incur a different hemispheric laterality. These findings add up to previous studies demonstrating that it is possible to modulate some processes involved in generation of untruthful answers by applying non-invasive brain stimulation over the DLPFC and extend these findings by showing a differential hemispheric contribution of DLPFCs according to contexts.", "pages": "119-24"}, {"volume": "508", "title": "Improving emotional prosody detection in the attending ear by cathodal tDCS suppression of the competing channel.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "22206843", "authors": ["Alexander, T", "Avirame, K", "Lavidor, M"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Currently it is assumed that cathodal stimulation (in transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) degrades the neural firing rate, and thus it is believed to degrade cognitive performance. Here we challenge this assumption by predicting that under high competition the cathodal stimulation might act as a noise filter, leading to an improved performance. We presented auditory targets with different emotional valence using a dichotic listening paradigm. We found that cathodal, but not anodal stimulation of the right IFG generated better prosody comprehension. Cathodal stimulation in competitive situations, such as the dichotic listening paradigm, can act like a noise filter, and may in fact enhance cognitive performance. This study contributes to understanding the way the IFG is engaged with prosody functions, and explains the cathodal effects of tDCS.

As a BMI signal source, event-related desynchronization of alpha-band EEG (8-13 Hz) during motor imagery (mu ERD), which is interpreted as desynchronized activities of the activated neurons, is commonly used. However, it is often difficult for patients with severe hemiparesis to produce mu ERD of sufficient strength to activate BMI. Therefore, whether it is possible to modulate mu ERD during motor imagery with anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) was assessed in a severe left hemiparetic stroke patient. EEG was recorded over the primary motor cortex (M1), and mu ERD during finger flexion imagery was measured before and after a 5-day course of tDCS applied to M1. The ERD recorded over the affected M1 increased significantly after tDCS intervention. Anodal tDCS may increase motor cortex excitability and potentiate ERD during motor imagery in patients with severe hemiparetic stroke.", "pages": "119-24"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Developing treatments for impaired cognition in schizophrenia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "17133529", "authors": ["Minzenberg, MJ", "Carter, CS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Trends in cognitive sciences", "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD) is a frequent complication of the ageing process, occurring in up to 5% of community-dwelling elderly and in a higher proportion of subjects with coexistent medical illnesses. Its presence has been consistently associated with cognitive impairment, greater disability and increased mortality. Approximately half of patients with LLD have evidence of subcortical ischaemic damage in prefrontal circuits revealed by MRI. This might constitute the biological substrate of the cardinal symptoms of depression and of executive dysfunction. An important proportion of patients with LLD do not achieve remission of their depressive symptoms in spite of adequate pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment. In addition, a group of LLD patients progress to further impairment and disability in the form of a dementing disorder. There is an imperative need to develop new treatment strategies for LLD. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are safe and efficacious interventions that might be used in combination with other therapeutic options to improve treatment outcomes.
