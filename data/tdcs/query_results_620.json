Probabilistic association learning, involving a gradual learning of cue-outcome associations, activates a frontal-striatal network in healthy adults. Studies of probabilistic association learning in schizophrenia have shown frontal-striatal dysfunction although considerable heterogeneity in performance has also been reported. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to improve probabilistic association learning in healthy adults. The aim of the current study was to determine the extent to which anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would reverse probabilistic association learning deficits in schizophrenia. Prior to tDCS, 20 people with schizophrenia performed an initial baseline assessment without stimulation. Anodal tDCS was administered continuously for 20 min at an intensity of 2.0 mA to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a single-blind, counterbalanced, sham-controlled, cross-over design while participants performed 150 trials of a probabilistic association learning test. Although anodal tDCS failed to improve probabilistic association learning based on the whole sample performance, greater variance in the active relative to the sham conditions suggested a subset of people may respond to treatment. Further correlation, regression and cluster analyses revealed differential effects of baseline performance on active tDCS and sham treatment and that there was a subset of people with schizophrenia who displayed improvement with tDCS suggesting that anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may facilitate access to existing prefrontal cortex neural reserves in people with schizophrenia who show adequate capacity to learn at baseline.", "pages": "198-205"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Uncovering Multisensory Processing through Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation.", "keywords": ["EEG", "brain states", "neurofeedback", "oscillation", "real-time analysis", "single-trial analysis"], "issue": "", "pmid": "21716922", "authors": ["Bolognini, N", "Maravita, A"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "abstract": "Most of current knowledge about the mechanisms of multisensory integration of environmental stimuli by the human brain derives from neuroimaging experiments. However, neuroimaging studies do not always provide conclusive evidence about the causal role of a given area for multisensory interactions, since these techniques can mainly derive correlations between brain activations and behavior. Conversely, techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) represent a unique and powerful approach to inform models of causal relations between specific brain regions and individual cognitive and perceptual functions. Although NIBS has been widely used in cognitive neuroscience, its use in the study of multisensory processing in the human brain appears a quite novel field of research. In this paper, we review and discuss recent studies that have used two techniques of NIBS, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, for investigating the causal involvement of unisensory and heteromodal cortical areas in multisensory processing, the effects of multisensory cues on cortical excitability in unisensory areas, and the putative functional connections among different cortical areas subserving multisensory interactions. The emerging view is that NIBS is an essential tool available to neuroscientists seeking for causal relationships between a given area or network and multisensory processes. With its already large and fast increasing usage, future work using NIBS in isolation, as well as in conjunction with different neuroimaging techniques, could substantially improve our understanding of multisensory processing in the human brain.", "pages": "198-205"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Probing of Brain States in Real-Time: Introducing the ConSole Environment.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "16182596", "authors": ["Hartmann, T", "Schulz, H", "Weisz, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "abstract": "Recent years have seen huge advancements in the methods available and used in neuroscience employing EEG or MEG. However, the standard approach is to average a large number of trials for experimentally defined conditions in order to reduce intertrial-variability, i.e., treating it as a source of \"noise.\" Yet it is now more and more accepted that trial-to-trial fluctuations bear functional significance, reflecting fluctuations of \"brain states\" that predispose perception and action. Such effects are often revealed in a pre-stimulus period, when comparing response variability to an invariant stimulus. However such offline analyses are disadvantageous as they are correlational by drawing conclusions in a post hoc-manner and stimulus presentation is random with respect to the feature of interest. A more direct test is to trigger stimulus presentation when the relevant feature is present. The current paper introduces Constance System for Online EEG (ConSole), a software package capable of analyzing ongoing EEG/MEG in real-time and presenting auditory and visual stimuli via internal routines. Stimulation via external devices (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation) or third-party software (e.g., PsyScope X) is possible by sending TTL-triggers. With ConSole it is thus possible to target the stimulation at specific brain states. In contrast to many available applications, ConSole is open-source. Its modular design enhances the power of the software as it can be easily adapted to new challenges and writing new experiments is an easy task. ConSole is already pre-equipped with modules performing standard signal processing steps. The software is also independent from the EEG/MEG system, as long as a driver can be written (currently two EEG systems are supported). Besides a general introduction, we present benchmark data regarding performance and validity of the calculations used, as well as three example applications of ConSole in different settings.

The present study examined the effects of TDCS delivered at the beginning of training (novice) or after an hour of training (experienced) on participants' ability to detect cues indicative of covert threats. Participants completed two 1-h training sessions. During the first 30\u00a0min of each training session, either 0.1\u00a0mA or 2.0\u00a0mA of anodal TDCS was delivered to the participant. The anode was positioned near F8, and the cathode was placed on the upper left arm. Testing trials immediately followed training. Accuracy in classification of images containing and not-containing threat stimuli during the testing sessions indicated: (1) that mastery of threat detection significantly increased with training, (2) that anodal TDCS at 2\u00a0mA significantly enhanced learning, and (3) TDCS was significantly more effective in enhancing test performance when applied in novice learners than in experienced learners. The enhanced performance following training with TDCS persisted into the second session when TDCS was delivered early in training.", "pages": "198-205"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Brain energy consumption induced by electrical stimulation promotes systemic glucose uptake.", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "16556505", "authors": ["Binkofski, F", "Loebig, M", "Jauch-Chara, K", "Bergmann, S", "Melchert, UH", "Scholand-Engler, HG", "Schweiger, U", "Pellerin, L", "Oltmanns, KM"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "Controlled transcranial stimulation of the brain is part of clinical treatment strategies in neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, stroke, or Parkinson's disease.

We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1%) in rCBF during stimulation, which returned to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive after-effects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area. Our results indicate that ASL may be an excellent tool to investigate the effects of tDCS and its stimulation parameters on brain activity.", "pages": "198-205"}, {"volume": "1403", "title": "Non-invasive electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB) modifies the resting-state network connectivity of the primary motor cortex: a proof of concept fMRI study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "20584184", "authors": ["Alon, G", "Roys, SR", "Gullapalli, RP", "Greenspan, JD"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Focal dystonia in musicians (MD) is a task-specific movement disorder with a loss of voluntary motor control during instrumental playing.
