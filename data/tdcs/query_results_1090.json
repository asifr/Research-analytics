A volley evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex was recorded from the medullary pyramid in an awake monkey performing a precision grip task.

A mean modulation of 13% in the amplitude of this volley was seen during task performance, with the largest volley occurring during the hold phase of the task. A similar pattern of modulation was seen in the EMG responses of hand and forearm muscles to TMS. 4. No comparable modulation was observed in a volley evoked by electrical stimulation of the corticospinal fibres via chronically implanted electrodes in the cerebral peduncle. 5. The results are compatible with direct activation of the corticospinal neurones by TMS at a site close to the soma, with the probability of activation by TMS depending on the current level of cortical excitability.", "pages": "795-801"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "Transcranial stimulation of the leg area of the motor cortex in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "1841949", "authors": ["Terao, Y", "Ugawa, Y", "Sakai, K", "Uesaka, Y", "Kohara, N", "Kanazawa, I"], "year": "1994", "journal": "Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "abstract": "We used transcranial magnetic stimulation on nine normal volunteers to establish an effective way to stimulate the leg area of the motor cortex.

The most stable responses were obtained when the large figure-eight coil was centered over the vertex and backward current was run through it or when the round coil was centered two to three centimeters anterior to the vertex with left-flowing current in it at the posterior widening.

Magnetic stimulation used a monophasic current pulse through a circular coil centred 3 cm anterior to the vertex. Lowest threshold magnetic stimulation occurred when the current in the coil flowed from the left to the right side at the posterior rim of the coil. Such stimulation produced single unit and surface EMG responses which had the same latency as those produced by anodal electric stimulation. If the direction of the magnetic stimulating current was reversed, response latencies became more variable from unit to unit, and on average they occurred 1.0 +/- 0.5 msec later. In single motor units anodal and magnetic post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) peaks had the same duration. This was similar to the duration of the PSTH peaks produced by a single low intensity stimulus given to the common peroneal nerve. We conclude that magnetic stimulation can produce direct activation of corticospinal neurones to the tibialis anterior if the direction of induced current flow is optimal.

Five different tissue types were incorporated into the model based on conductivities taken from the literature. The boundary value problem derived from Laplace's equation was solved with a quasi-static approximation. Transcranial electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes was poorly focussed and required high levels of current for stimulation of the cortex. Direct cortical stimulation with bipolar (adjacent) electrodes was found to be very effective in producing localized current flows. Unipolar cortical stimulation (with a more distant reference electrode) produced higher current densities at the same stimulating current as did bipolar stimulation, but stimulated a larger region of the cortex. With the simulated electrodes resting on the pia-arachnoid, as usually occurs clinically, there was significant shunting of the current (7/8 of the total current) through the CSF.

Latencies of nasalis muscle responses to magStim were, therefore, compared with those obtained by direct electrical stimulation of the facial nerve (a) at the root exit zone (REZ); (b) at the porus of the facial canal; and (c) in the stylomastoid fossa during microvascular decompression operations in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Measurements of latencies of the nasalis muscle response, obtained while the stimulating coil was placed over the parieto-occipital area of the scalp, indicated that it was the labryinthine segment of the facial canal, 5 to 16 mm distal to the CPA, that was activated. This would be in agreement with studies of physical models reported in the literature that showed (a) the strength of the electrical current generated by a magnetic field is particularly high close to a nerve foramen; and (b) excitation to magStim is most likely to occur where the induced electrical field changes rapidly over distance, i.e., at anatomical boundaries between media of high and low specific resistance. These characteristics are found at the end of the labyrinthine segment of the facial canal, where the facial nerve leaves the low-resistance cerebrospinal fluid and enters the high-resistance petrous bone. The site of neural excitation is robust and unaffected by stimulus intensity and current direction within a wide range, or by large changes in location of the coil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "795-801"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Physiological studies of electric and magnetic stimulation of the human brain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "3079553", "authors": ["Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology. Supplement", "abstract": "It is suggested that transcranial electric stimulation can activate pyramidal tract projections both directly and indirectly in a manner similar to that described after direct stimulation of the exposed cortex in the monkey. This produces both D- and I-waves in the pyramidal tract. At high intensities of stimulation, the stimulus can spread into the brain and activate pyramidal tract axons several centimeters below the cortical surface. Magnetic stimulation at moderate intensities produces electromyographic (EMG) responses with latencies 1-2 msec longer than those after electric stimulation. Two possible explanations have been put forward to account for this effect: (1) because of the difference in the direction of electric current flow induced in the brain by the 2 forms of stimulation, magnetic stimulation preferentially excites pyramidal tract cells indirectly, and hence evokes only I-waves in the pyramidal tract. (2) Electric stimulation (even at threshold) activates pyramidal axons deep in the white matter, whereas magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal cells in the gray matter, probably at their initial segment. There is one interesting consequence common to both explanations. Whether magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically or at their initial segment, the size of the descending volley evoked will depend on the level of excitability of the motor cortex. In contrast, the response to electric stimulation will be less affected, since a proportion of the descending volley is initiated directly at the axon of the pyramidal cell. This differential effect of cortical excitability on the responses to electrical and magnetic stimulation can be useful in describing excitatory or inhibitory influences on motor cortex from other structures.", "pages": "795-801"}, {"volume": "91", "title": "[Transcranial electric stimulation therapy in the treatment of neurocirculatory asthenia].", "keywords": [], "issue": "7", "pmid": "3543727", "authors": ["Akimov, GA", "Zabolotnykh, VA", "Lebedev, VP", "Zabolotnykh, II", "Chuprasova, TV", "Afoshin, SA", "Rozanov, SI", "Kassin, PL", "Preobrazhenskaia, SL"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Zhurnal nevropatologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Both electrical (with the anode overlying the face area of the motor cortex) and magnetic TCS (with the coil at the vertex) excite the upper motoneurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus, evoking motor potentials (C-MEPs) in the jaw-closing and suprahyoid muscles, but only during voluntary contraction. At least 30% of jaw-closing motoneurons are reached by direct fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are mainly crossed. Suprahyoid motoneurons are also reached by fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are probably bilateral. In the masseter, electrical TCS also evokes an ipsilateral motor response (R-MEP), followed by a later wave (U), and bilateral inhibitory periods. The R-MEP is secondary to excitation of the motor trigeminal root; the U wave probably results from the simultaneous excitation of Ia afferents in the root and ipsilaterally projecting corticofugal fibres; the inhibitory periods are largely due to activation of exteroceptive afferents in the root. Magnetic TCS, avoiding spread of current to the trigeminal root, evokes C-MEPs but not R-MEPs or U waves. The masseter inhibitory period after magnetic TCS may be due to excitation of corticofugal inhibitory fibres and to mechanical activation of Golgi tendon organs.", "pages": "795-801"}]
