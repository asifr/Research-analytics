This IG-tDCS system was based on the array-type tDCS concept, which was validated through computer simulations in a previous study. Unlike a previous study, the present IG-tDCS system adopts a single reference electrode and an active electrode array consisting of 16 (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04) sub-electrodes. The proposed IG-tDCS system is capable of shaping current flow inside the human head by controlling the input currents of the arrayed electrodes. Once a target brain area has been selected, the optimal injection current of each arrayed sub-electrode is evaluated automatically using a genetic algorithm in order to deliver the maximum available current to the target area. The operation of our pilot system was confirmed through a simple phantom experiment.", "pages": "937-50"}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation over the left prefrontal cortex facilitates cognitive flexibility in tool use.", "keywords": ["Active movement", "EMG", "Electromyography", "FDI", "First dorsal interosseus muscle", "IEMG", "Integrated electromyography", "MEP", "MVC", "Maximum voluntary contraction", "Motor evoked potential", "PED", "PEF", "Passive movement", "Post-exercise depression", "Post-exercise facilitation", "TMS", "Transcranial direct current stimulation", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation", "tDCS"], "issue": "2", "pmid": "23894253", "authors": ["Chrysikou, EG", "Hamilton, RH", "Coslett, HB", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Thompson-Schill, SL"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Recent neuroscience evidence suggests that some higher-order tasks might benefit from a reduction in sensory filtering associated with low levels of cognitive control.

We believe that a network perspective is necessary to understand this common neurological symptom, and that knowledge of cerebral network dysfunction in tremor disorders will help to develop new therapies. Both essential tremor and Parkinson's tremor are associated with increased activity in the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. However, different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to tremulous activity within this circuit. In Parkinson's disease, evidence suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction of the pallidum triggers increased activity in the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. In essential tremor, GABAergic dysfunction of the cerebellar dentate nucleus and brain stem, possibly caused by neurodegeneration in these regions, may lead to tremulous activity within the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. In both disorders, network parameters such as the strength and directionality of interregional coupling are crucially altered. Exciting new research uses these network parameters to develop network-based therapies, such as closed-loop deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic or direct current stimulation.", "pages": "937-50"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Technique and considerations in the use of 4x1 ring high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS).", "keywords": ["Motor cortex", "Skilled movement", "Skilled reaching behavior", "Somatosensory cortex", "tDCS"], "issue": "77", "pmid": "23893039", "authors": ["Villamar, MF", "Volz, MS", "Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Dasilva, AF", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "abstract": "High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has recently been developed as a noninvasive brain stimulation approach that increases the accuracy of current delivery to the brain by using arrays of smaller \"high-definition\" electrodes, instead of the larger pad-electrodes of conventional tDCS. Targeting is achieved by energizing electrodes placed in predetermined configurations. One of these is the 4x1-ring configuration. In this approach, a center ring electrode (anode or cathode) overlying the target cortical region is surrounded by four return electrodes, which help circumscribe the area of stimulation. Delivery of 4x1-ring HD-tDCS is capable of inducing significant neurophysiological and clinical effects in both healthy subjects and patients. Furthermore, its tolerability is supported by studies using intensities as high as 2.0 milliamperes for up to twenty minutes. Even though 4x1 HD-tDCS is simple to perform, correct electrode positioning is important in order to accurately stimulate target cortical regions and exert its neuromodulatory effects. The use of electrodes and hardware that have specifically been tested for HD-tDCS is critical for safety and tolerability. Given that most published studies on 4x1 HD-tDCS have targeted the primary motor cortex (M1), particularly for pain-related outcomes, the purpose of this article is to systematically describe its use for M1 stimulation, as well as the considerations to be taken for safe and effective stimulation. However, the methods outlined here can be adapted for other HD-tDCS configurations and cortical targets.", "pages": "937-50"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Behavioral effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) induced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plasticity in alcohol dependence.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15661300", "authors": ["da Silva, MC", "Conti, CL", "Klauss, J", "Alves, LG", "do Nascimento Cavalcante, HM", "Fregni, F", "Nitsche, MA", "Nakamura-Palacios, EM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of physiology, Paris", "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to reduce acute substance craving in drug addicts, and improve cognition in neuropsychiatric patients. Here we aimed to explore further tDCS induced behavioral and neurophysiological modulation including assessment of relapse rate over a prolonged time course in alcoholism. We examined the effects of repeated anodal tDCS (2mA, 35 cm(2), 20min) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on relapse to the use of alcohol in alcoholics from outpatient services, who received additional routine clinical treatment. Furthermore, event related potentials (ERPs), cognitive and frontal executive processes, craving, depressive and anxiety symptoms were obtained before and after treatment. From thirteen alcoholic subjects, seven were randomized to sham-tDCS and six to real tDCS treatment (once a week for five consecutive weeks). Depressive symptoms and craving were reduced to a larger extent in the tDCS group compared to the sham group (p=0.005 and p=0.015, respectively). On the other hand, active tDCS was able to block the increase in neural activation triggered by alcohol related and neutral cues in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as indexed by ERP as seen in the sham-tDCS group. Finally, there was a trend for increased change in executive function in the tDCS group compared to the sham-tDCS group (p=0.082), and, similarly, a trend for more relapses in the tDCS group compared to sham tDCS (four alcoholic subjects (66.7%) vs. one (14.3%), p=0.053).These results confirm the previous findings of tDCS effects on craving in alcoholism and also extend these findings as we showed also tDCS-related mood improvement. However, potential increase in relapse is possible; thus the clinical value of an increase in craving and improvement in depression and executive function needs to be carefully assessed in further studies; including investigation of optimal parameters of stimulation.", "pages": "937-50"}, {"volume": "1529", "title": "Corticomotor excitability induced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation with and without non-exhaustive movement.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "21320389", "authors": ["Miyaguchi, S", "Onishi, H", "Kojima, S", "Sugawara, K", "Tsubaki, A", "Kirimoto, H", "Tamaki, H", "Yamamoto, N"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "We investigated whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the motor cortex during non-exhaustive active or passive movements enhances corticomotor excitability after tDCS or whether it reduces post-exercise depression (PED) after non-exhaustive active or passive movements if PED was observed without tDCS. Nine healthy subjects participated in this study. Anodal tDCS with a current of 2 mA was applied to the left scalp over the primary motor area. All subjects underwent the following five interventions: tDCS delivered for 10 min during relaxation (tDCS condition) and repetitive voluntary and passive finger abduction-adduction movements, each performed without and with tDCS for 10 min (active condition, tDCS+active condition, passive condition, tDCS+passive condition). The active movements were performed at 10% maximum voluntary contraction. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseus muscle before the intervention (pre-intervention) and 2 and 10 min after the intervention (post-2 min and post-10 min, respectively). Under the tDCS condition, the MEP amplitudes at post-2 and -10 min were significantly increased compared with those before the intervention. Under the active, passive, and tDCS+active conditions, the MEP amplitudes at post-2 min were significantly decreased compared with those before the interventions. Under the tDCS+passive condition, the MEP amplitude remained unchanged. These results demonstrated that anodal tDCS did not reduce PED after active movements but after passive movements and that the anodal tDCS effects were highly dependent on the state of the subject during stimulation.", "pages": "937-50"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Frequency-dependent enhancement of fluid intelligence induced by transcranial oscillatory potentials.", "keywords": [], "issue": "15", "pmid": "17251360", "authors": ["Santarnecchi, E", "Polizzotto, NR", "Godone, M", "Giovannelli, F", "Feurra, M", "Matzen, L", "Rossi, A", "Rossi, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "Everyday problem solving requires the ability to go beyond experience by efficiently encoding and manipulating new information, i.e., fluid intelligence (Gf) [1]. Performance in tasks involving Gf, such as logical and abstract reasoning, has been shown to rely on distributed neural networks, with a crucial role played by prefrontal regions [2]. Synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma band is a ubiquitous phenomenon within the brain; however, no evidence of its causal involvement in cognition exists to date [3]. Here, we show an enhancement of Gf ability in a cognitive task induced by exogenous rhythmic stimulation within the gamma band. Imperceptible alternating current [4] delivered through the scalp over the left middle frontal gyrus resulted in a frequency-specific shortening of the time required to find the correct solution in a visuospatial abstract reasoning task classically employed to measure Gf abilities (i.e., Raven's matrices) [5]. Crucially, gamma-band stimulation (\u03b3-tACS) selectively enhanced performance only on more complex trials involving conditional/logical reasoning.

Consequently, growing interest emerged to evaluate new strategies to delay or counteract cognitive decline in aging. Here, we assessed immediate effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) on cognition and previously described detrimental changes in brain activity attributable to aging. Twenty healthy elderly adults were assessed in a crossover sham-controlled design using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and concurrent transcranial DCS administered to the left inferior frontal gyrus. Effects on performance and task-related brain activity were evaluated during overt semantic word generation, a task that is negatively affected by advanced age. Task-absent resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) assessed atDCS-induced changes at the network level independent of performance. Twenty matched younger adults served as controls. During sham stimulation, task-related fMRI demonstrated that enhanced bilateral prefrontal activity in older adults was associated with reduced performance. RS-fMRI revealed enhanced anterior and reduced posterior functional brain connectivity. atDCS significantly improved performance in older adults up to the level of younger controls; significantly reduced task-related hyperactivity in bilateral prefrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the precuneus; and induced a more \"youth-like\" connectivity pattern during RS-fMRI. Our results provide converging evidence from behavioral analysis and two independent functional imaging paradigms that a single session of atDCS can temporarily reverse nonbeneficial effects of aging on cognition and brain activity and connectivity.

Approximately half of those affected will remain in this state despite intensive language therapy. Non-invasive brain stimulation allows us to directly and focally stimulate areas of the brain. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), methods used in the treatment of aphasia, are based on an imbalance of mutual interhemispheric inhibition. In open and sham-controlled studies, a low-frequency, 1Hz stimulation of the non-lesioned hemisphere (the homologue of Broca's area) for a week or more significantly improved spontaneous speech and anomia in patients with non-fluent aphasia. These positive outcomes from rTMS stimulation developed slowly, often over months following treatment, and persisted. Effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) developed faster than the low-frequency stimulation, and high-activity enhancement was detected in the left hemisphere after the stimulation of Broca's region. Both types of tDCS stimulation resulted in improved comprehension and reduced anomia, their primary modes of action are distinct, however, both share a common site of action with regard to the balance that occurs between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters (synaptic and non-synaptic).

Here we used anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is able to alter polarity-specific excitability in the S1, to facilitate skilled movement in intact behaving rats. We hypothesized that the critical role of S1 in reaching performance can be enhanced by bilateral tDCS. Pretrained rats were assigned to control or stimulation conditions: (1) UnAno: the unilateral application of an anodal current to the side contralateral to the paw preferred for reaching; (2) BiAno1: bilateral anodal current; (3) BiAno2: a bilateral anodal current with additional 30ms of 65\u03bcA pulses every 5s. Rats received tDCS (65\u03bcA; 10min/rat) to the S1 during skilled reach training for 20 days (online-effect phase). After-effect assessment occurred for the next ten days in the absence of electrical stimulation. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of online-effects of tDCS showed that UnAno and BiAno1 somatosensory stimulation significantly improve skilled reaching performance. Bilateral BiAno1 stimulation was associated with greater qualitative functional improvement than unilateral UnAno stimulation. tDCS-induced improvements were not observed in the after-effects phase. Quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis revealed that somatosensory tDCS bilaterally increases cortical neural density.
