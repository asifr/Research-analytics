We aimed to change baseline activity of the auditory cortex using tDCS as to modulate temporal aspects of auditory processing in healthy subjects without hearing impairment. Eleven subjects received 2mA bilateral anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS over auditory cortex in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Subjects were evaluated by the Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT), a test measuring temporal processing abilities in the auditory domain, before and during the stimulation. Statistical analysis revealed a significant interaction effect of time vs. tDCS condition for 4000 Hz and for clicks. Post-hoc tests showed significant differences according to stimulation polarity on RGDT performance: anodal improved 22.5% and cathodal decreased 54.5% subjects' performance, as compared to baseline. For clicks, anodal also increased performance in 29.4% when compared to baseline. tDCS presented polarity-dependent effects on the activity of the auditory cortex, which results in a positive or negative impact in a temporal resolution task performance. These results encourage further studies exploring tDCS in central auditory processing disorders.", "pages": "e25399"}, {"volume": "215", "title": "Excitability changes induced in the human auditory cortex by transcranial direct current stimulation: direct electrophysiological evidence.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "10990547", "authors": ["Zaehle, T", "Beretta, M", "J\u00e4ncke, L", "Herrmann, CS", "Sandmann, P"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Objective electrophysiological evidence for tDCS-induced excitability changes has been demonstrated for the visual and somatosensory cortex, while evidence for excitability changes in the auditory cortex is lacking. In the present study, we applied tDCS over the left temporal as well as the left temporo-parietal cortex and investigated tDCS-induced effects on auditory evoked potentials after anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation. Results show that anodal and cathodal tDCS can modify auditory cortex reactivity. Moreover, auditory evoked potentials were differentially modulated as a function of site of stimulation. While anodal tDCS over the temporal cortex increased auditory P50 amplitudes, cathodal tDCS over the temporo-parietal cortex induced larger N1 amplitudes. The results directly demonstrate excitability changes in the auditory cortex induced by active tDCS over the temporal and temporo-parietal cortex and might contribute to the understanding of mechanisms involved in the successful treatment of auditory disorders like tinnitus via tDCS.", "pages": "e25399"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Modulation of large-scale brain networks by transcranial direct current stimulation evidenced by resting-state functional MRI.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "11012239", "authors": ["Pe\u00f1a-G\u00f3mez, C", "Sala-Lonch, R", "Junqu\u00e9, C", "Clemente, IC", "Vidal, D", "Bargall\u00f3, N", "Falc\u00f3n, C", "Valls-Sol\u00e9, J", "Pascual-Leone, \u00c1", "Bartr\u00e9s-Faz, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Brain areas interact mutually to perform particular complex brain functions such as memory or language.
