Thus, a whole array of stimulation approaches has been developed as potential new antidepressant interventions. These methods include transcranial convulsive and non-convulsive approaches, e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as well as invasive techniques, e.g. deep brain stimulation (DBS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and epidural cortical stimulation (ECS). Each method represents a specific therapeutic approach with distinct targets within neural networks involved in the pathophysiology of depression. The ECT procedure is an established treatment with the highest efficacy of all antidepressant interventions and TMS reaches the highest level of evidence among the novel neurostimulation approaches and may be clinically used. However, the field yields a promising rapid development which may substantially enrich the armamentarium of antidepressant interventions in the near future.", "pages": "1006-12"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Good vibrations: oscillatory phase shapes perception.", "keywords": ["d-cycloserine", "human", "motor cortex", "neuroplasticity", "pergolide", "tDCS"], "issue": "2", "pmid": "22836177", "authors": ["Neuling, T", "Rach, S", "Wagner, S", "Wolters, CH", "Herrmann, CS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "In the current study, we provide compelling evidence to answer the long-standing question whether perception is continuous or periodic. Spontaneous brain oscillations are assumed to be the underlying mechanism of periodic perception. Depending on the phase angle of the oscillations, an identical stimulus results in different perceptual outcomes. Past results, however, can only account for a correlation of perception with the phase of the ongoing brain oscillations. Therefore, it is desirable to demonstrate a causal relation between phase and perception. One way to address this question is to entrain spontaneous brain oscillations by applying an external oscillation and then demonstrate behavioral consequences of this oscillation. We conducted an auditory detection experiment with humans, recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) concurrently and simultaneously applied oscillating transcranial direct current stimulation at 10Hz (\u03b1-tDCS). Our approach revealed that detection thresholds were dependent on the phase of the oscillation that was entrained by \u03b1-tDCS. This behavioral effect was accompanied by an electrophysiological effect: \u03b1-power was enhanced after \u03b1-tDCS as compared to a pre-stimulation period. By showing a causal relation between phase and perception, our results extend findings of previous studies that were only able to demonstrate a correlation. We found that manipulation of the phase resulted in different detection thresholds, which supports the notion that perception can be periodically modulated by oscillatory processes. This demonstrates that tDCS can serve as a tool in neuroscience to extend the knowledge of the functional significance of brain oscillations.", "pages": "1006-12"}, {"volume": "46", "title": "Synaptic plasticity in neurodegenerative diseases evaluated and modulated by in vivo neurophysiological techniques.", "keywords": ["pain", "spinal cord", "transcranial direct current stimulation", "transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation"], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22821187", "authors": ["Pilato, F", "Profice, P", "Ranieri, F", "Capone, F", "Di Iorio, R", "Florio, L", "Di Lazzaro, V"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "abstract": "Several studies demonstrated in experimental models and in humans synaptic plasticity impairment in some neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. Recently new neurophysiological tools, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, have been introduced in experimental and clinical settings for studying physiology of the brain and modulating cortical activity. These techniques use noninvasive transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation to modulate neurons activity in the human brain. Cortical stimulation might enhance or inhibit the activity of cortico-subcortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity, current polarity, and other stimulation parameters such as the configuration of the induced electric field and stimulation protocols. On this basis, in the last two decades, these techniques have rapidly become valuable tools to investigate physiology of the human brain and have been applied to treat drug-resistant neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we describe these techniques and discuss the mechanisms that may explain these effects.", "pages": "1006-12"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Testing the activation-orientation account of spatial attentional asymmetries using transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "22820341", "authors": ["Loftus, AM", "Nicholls, ME"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "abstract": "The general population shows an attentional bias to the left, known as pseudoneglect. This bias is thought to be driven by higher levels of activation in right parietal areas. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to manipulate activation, this study examined whether tDCS over the left and right posterior parietal cortices (PPC) affects pseudoneglect. Normal participants received tDCS over the left or right PPCs (15 in each group). Pseudoneglect was measured using the greyscales task, which requires a forced-choice discrimination of luminance between two opposing luminance gradients. The greyscales task was administered both before and after; (a) anodal (b) cathodal and (c) sham tDCS. Participants who received tDCS over the left PPC demonstrated pseudoneglect for the greyscales task, which was significantly reduced by anodal tDCS, but was unaffected by sham or cathodal tDCS. In contrast, for those participants who received right PPC tDCS, pseudoneglect for the greyscales task was unaffected by tDCS. Anodal tDCS, which is known to elevate neural excitation, may have overcome lower levels of activation in the left PPC, resulting in decreased pseudoneglect. These findings provide convincing evidence in support of an activation-orientation model of pseudoneglect and have implications for models of left neglect.", "pages": "1006-12"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Brain stimulation methods to treat tobacco addiction.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "22809824", "authors": ["Wing, VC", "Barr, MS", "Wass, CE", "Lipsman, N", "Lozano, AM", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "George, TP"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, but many smokers are simply unable to quit.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation, has shown to produce beneficial neural effects in consequence with improvements in motor behavior. tDCS has gained popularity as it is economical, simple to use, portable, and increases corticospinal excitability without producing any serious side effects. As tDCS has been increasingly investigated as an effective tool for various disorders, numerous improvements, and developments have been proposed with respect to this technique. tDCS has been widely used to identify the functional relevance of particular brain regions in motor skill learning and also to facilitate activity in specific cortical areas involved in motor learning, in turn improving motor function. Understanding the interaction between tDCS and motor learning can lead to important implications for developing various rehabilitation approaches. This paper provides a concise overview of tDCS as a neuromodulatory technique and its interaction with motor learning.
