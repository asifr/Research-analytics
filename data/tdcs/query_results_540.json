However, little is known about the neurophysiological effects of tDCS on proximal upper limb function. We hypothesized that suppression of contralesional M1 (cM1) excitability would produce neurophysiological effects that depended on the severity of upper limb impairment. Twelve patients with varying upper limb impairment after subcortical stroke were assessed on clinical scales of upper limb spasticity, impairment, and function. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine lesion size and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the posterior limbs of the internal capsules indicative of corticospinal tract integrity. Excitability within paretic M1 biceps brachii representation was determined from motor-evoked potentials during selective isometric tasks, after cM1 sham stimulation and after c-tDCS. These neurophysiological data indicate that c-tDCS improved selective proximal upper limb control for mildly impaired patients and worsened it for moderate to severely impaired patients. The direction of the neurophysiological after effects of c-tDCS was strongly related to upper limb spasticity, impairment, function, and FA asymmetry between the posterior limbs of the internal capsules. These results indicate systematic variation of cM1 for proximal upper limb control after stroke and that suppression of cM1 excitability is not a \"one size fits all\" approach.", "pages": "2662-71"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Assessment and treatment of pain with non-invasive cortical stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "22124038", "authors": ["Zaghi, S", "Thiele, B", "Pimentel, D", "Pimentel, T", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "There remains an unmet clinical need for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of pain.

The course of recovery from aphasia after stroke is variable, and relies on the emergence of neuroplastic changes in language networks. Recent evidence suggests that rehabilitation interventions may facilitate these changes. Functional reorganization of language networks following left-hemisphere stroke and aphasia has been proposed to involve multiple mechanisms, including intrahemispheric recruitment of perilesional left-hemisphere regions and transcallosal interhemispheric interactions between lesioned left-hemisphere language areas and homologous regions in the right hemisphere. Moreover, it is debated whether interhemispheric interactions are beneficial or deleterious to recovering language networks. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are two safe and noninvasive procedures that can be applied clinically to modulate cortical excitability during poststroke language recovery. Intervention with these noninvasive brain stimulation techniques also allows for inferences to be made regarding mechanisms of recovery, including the role of intrahemispheric and interhemispheric interactions. Here we review recent evidence that suggests that TMS and tDCS are promising tools for facilitating language recovery in aphasic patients, and examine evidence that indicates that both right and left hemisphere mechanisms of plasticity are instrumental in aphasia recovery.", "pages": "2662-71"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Optimizing recovery potential through simultaneous occupational therapy and non-invasive brain-stimulation using tDCS.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "22124031", "authors": ["Nair, DG", "Renga, V", "Lindenberg, R", "Zhu, L", "Schlaug, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Purposeful manipulation of cortical plasticity and excitability within somatosensory regions may have therapeutic potential.
