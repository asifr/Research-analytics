So far, however, research has mainly focused on the effects of tDCS on cognitive control operations for non-emotional material. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects on cognitive control considering negative versus positive material. For this sham-controlled, within-subjects study, we selected a homogeneous sample of twenty-five healthy participants. By using behavioral measures and event related potentials (ERP) as indexes, we aimed to investigate whether a single session of anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would have specific effects in enhancing cognitive control for positive and negative valenced stimuli. After tDCS over the left DLPFC (and not sham control stimulation), we observed more negative N450 amplitudes along with faster reaction times when inhibiting a habitual response to happy compared to sad facial expressions. Gender did not influence the effects of tDCS on cognitive control for emotional information. In line with the Valence Theory of side-lateralized activity, this stimulation protocol might have led to a left dominant (relative to right) prefrontal cortical activity, resulting in augmented cognitive control specifically for positive relative to negative stimuli. To verify that tDCS induces effects that are in line with all aspects of the well known Valence Theory, future research should investigate the effects of tDCS over the left vs. right DLPFC on cognitive control for emotional information.", "pages": "e62219"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Differential effects of dual and unihemispheric motor cortex stimulation in older adults.", "keywords": ["EMG-EMG coherence", "chest wall kinematics", "motor control", "respiratory muscles"], "issue": "21", "pmid": "3397865", "authors": ["Lindenberg, R", "Nachtigall, L", "Meinzer, M", "Sieg, MM", "Fl\u00f6el, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is thought to upregulate excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) using anodal stimulation while concurrently downregulating contralateral M1 using cathodal stimulation. This \"dual\" tDCS method enhances motor learning in healthy subjects and facilitates motor recovery after stroke. However, its impact on motor system activity and connectivity remains unknown. Therefore, we assessed neural correlates of dual and unihemispheric anodal tDCS effects in 20 healthy older subjects in a randomized, sham-controlled study using a cross-over design. Participants underwent tDCS and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging during a choice reaction time task and at rest. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allowed us to relate potential functional changes to structural parameters. The resting-state analysis demonstrated that, compared with sham, both dual and anodal tDCS decreased connectivity of right hippocampus and M1 (contralateral to the anode position) while increasing connectivity in the left prefrontal cortex. Notably, dual but not anodal tDCS enhanced connectivity of the left dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, dual tDCS yielded stronger activations in bilateral M1 compared with anodal tDCS when participants used either their left or right hand during the motor task. The corresponding tDCS-induced changes in laterality of activations were related to the microstructural status of transcallosal motor fibers. In conclusion, our results suggest that the impact of bihemispheric tDCS cannot be explained by mere add-on effects of anodal and concurrent cathodal stimulation, but rather by complex network modulations involving interhemispheric interactions and areas associated with motor control in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex.", "pages": "e62219"}, {"volume": "124", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation and the autonomic nervous system.", "keywords": ["bilateral tDCS", "functional connectivity", "interhemispheric", "intracortical", "primary motor cortex", "tDCS", "unilateral tDCS"], "issue": "9", "pmid": "12667546", "authors": ["Schestatsky, P", "Simis, M", "Freeman, R", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive methods of brain stimulation (NIBS) that can induce significant effects on cortical and subcortical neural networks. Both methods are relatively safe if appropriate guidelines are followed, and both can exert neuromodulatory effects that may be applied to the investigation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In addition, ANS measures can shed important light onto the neurobiologic mechanisms of NIBS. Here we present a systematic review on studies testing NIBS and ANS simultaneously. We structure our findings into four broad (not mutually exclusive) categories: (i) studies in which ANS function was modified by NIBS versus those in which it was not; (ii) studies in which NIBS was used to understand ANS function, (iii) studies in which ANS was used to understand NIBS mechanisms and (iv) NIBS/ANS studies conducted in healthy subjects versus those in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases. Forty-four articles were identified and no conclusive evidence of the effects of NIBS on ANS was observed, mainly because of the heterogeneity of included studies. Based on a comprehensive summary of this literature we propose how NIBS might be further developed to enhance our understanding of the cortical mechanisms of autonomic regulation and perhaps to modulate autonomic activity for therapeutic purposes.", "pages": "e62219"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Effect of serotonin on paired associative stimulation-induced plasticity in the human motor cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "11", "pmid": "15895421", "authors": ["Batsikadze, G", "Paulus, W", "Kuo, MF", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Serotonin modulates diverse brain functions. Beyond its clinical antidepressant effects, it improves motor performance, learning and memory formation. These effects might at least be partially caused by the impact of serotonin on neuroplasticity, which is thought to be an important foundation of the respective functions. In principal accordance, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors enhance long-term potentiation-like plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in humans. As other neuromodulators have discernable effects on different kinds of plasticity in humans, here we were interested to explore the impact of serotonin on paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced plasticity, which induces a more focal kind of plasticity, as compared with tDCS, shares some features with spike timing-dependent plasticity, and is thought to be relative closely related to learning processes. In this single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, we administered a single dose of 20\u2009mg citalopram or placebo medication and applied facilitatory- and excitability-diminishing PAS to the left motor cortex of 14 healthy subjects. Cortico-spinal excitability was explored via single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited MEP amplitudes up to the next evening after plasticity induction. After citalopram administration, inhibitory PAS-induced after-effects were abolished and excitatory PAS-induced after-effects were enhanced trendwise, as compared with the respective placebo conditions. These results show that serotonin modulates PAS-induced neuroplasticity by shifting it into the direction of facilitation, which might help to explain mechanism of positive therapeutic effects of serotonin in learning and medical conditions characterized by enhanced inhibitory or reduced facilitatory plasticity, including depression and stroke.", "pages": "e62219"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "[Electroconvulsive therapy in schizophrenia].", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15999258", "authors": ["Takebayashi, M"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Nihon rinsho.

Currently, the application of ECT for schizophrenia is controversial because of several international guidelines; however, catatonia is acceptable for the indications by all guidelines. Schizophrenic patients with affective, catatonic, and positive symptoms of recent onset may respond favorably to ECT. Additionally, ECT may improve responsivity to pharmacotherapy for some indications. Therefore, a combination of ECT with pharmacotherapy including clozapine may be effective for the pharmacotherapy -resistant schizophrenia. Another argument is that the relapse rate after ECT response is very high compared to that of mood disorders; development of maintenance therapy(pharmacotherapy or ECT) is anticipated for the prevention of relapse. Because maintenance ECT seems to be a burden on remitted patients, to study both maintenance pharmacotherapy and the novel application of non-invasive treatment, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for maintenance therapy instead of ECT could be fruitful.", "pages": "e62219"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "Modulation of chest wall intermuscular coherence: effects of lung volume excursion and transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "16603933", "authors": ["Tomczak, CR", "Greidanus, KR", "Boliek, CA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Chest wall muscle recruitment varies as a function of the breathing task performed. However, the cortical control of the chest wall muscles during different breathing tasks is not known. We studied chest wall intermuscular coherence during various task-related lung volume excursions in 10 healthy adults (34 \u00b1 15 yr; 2 men, 8 women) and determined if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could modulate chest wall intermuscular coherence during these tasks. Simultaneous assessment of regional intercostal and oblique electromyographic activity was measured while participants performed standardized tidal breathing, speech, maximum phonation, and vital capacity tasks. Lung volume and chest wall kinematics were determined using variable inductance plethysmography. We found that chest wall area of intermuscular coherence was greater during tidal and speech breathing compared with phonation and vital capacity (all P < 0.05) and between tidal breathing compared with speech breathing (P < 0.05). Anodal tDCS increased chest wall area of intermuscular coherence from 0.04 \u00b1 0.09 prestimulation to 0.18 \u00b1 0.19 poststimulation for vital capacity (P < 0.05). Sham tDCS and cathodal tDCS had no effect on coherence during lung volume excursions. Chest wall kinematics were not affected by tDCS. Our findings indicate that lung volume excursions about the midrange of vital capacity elicit a greater area of chest wall intermuscular coherence compared with lung volume excursions spanning the entire range of vital capacity in healthy adults.

In the present study, two different tDCS setups were investigated: (i) unilateral M1 tDCS (anode over right M1, cathode over the contralateral supraorbital region) and (ii) bilateral M1 tDCS (anode over right M1, cathode over left M1). In a randomized single-blinded cross-over design, 12 healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest before, during and after 20\u2009min of either bi-, unilateral, or sham M1 tDCS. Seed-based FC analysis was used to investigate tDCS-induced changes across and within M1. We found that bilateral M1 tDCS induced (a) a decrease in interhemispheric FC during stimulation and (b) an increase in intracortical FC within right M1 after termination of the intervention. While unilateral M1 tDCS also resulted in similar effects during stimulation, no such changes could be observed after termination of tDCS.

Experimental data in healthy subjects extend the cerebellar role to learning, emotional and mood control. The need for a non-invasive tool to influence cerebellar function in normal and pathological conditions led researchers to develop transcranial cerebellar direct current stimulation (tcDCS). tcDCS, like tDCS, depends on the principle that weak direct currents delivered at around 2mA for minutes over the cerebellum through surface electrodes induce prolonged changes in cerebellar function. tcDCS modulates several cerebellar skills in humans including motor control, learning and emotional processing. tcDCS also influences the cerebello-brain interactions induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), walking adaptation, working memory and emotional recognition.

Despite clinical success with existing tDCS parameters; optimal protocols are still not entirely set. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) with three electrode sizes on corticospinal excitability. METHODS: a-tDCS was applied with three active electrode sizes of 12, 24 and 35\u00a0cm(2) with a constant current density of 0.029\u00a0mA/cm(2) on twelve right handed healthy individuals (mean age: 34.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.32\u00a0years) in different sessions at least 48\u00a0h apart. a-tDCS was applied continuously for 10\u00a0min, with a constant reference electrode size of 35\u00a0cm(2). The corticospinal excitability of extensor carpi radialis muscle (ECR) was measured before and immediately after the intervention and at 10, 20 and 30\u00a0min thereafter. RESULTS: We found that smaller electrode may produce more focal current density and could lead to more effective and localized neural modulation than the larger ones. Post hoc comparisons showed that active electrode of 12\u00a0cm(2) size induces the biggest increase in the corticospinal excitability compared to bigger electrode sizes, 24\u00a0cm(2) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and 35\u00a0cm(2) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). There was no significant difference between two larger electrode sizes (24\u00a0cm(2) and 35\u00a0cm(2)) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.177). a-tDCS resulted in significant excitability enhancement lasting for 30\u00a0min after the end of stimulation in the 12 and 24\u00a0cm(2) electrode size conditions (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). However, in 35\u00a0cm(2) electrode size condition, the MEP amplitudes of the ECR did not differ significantly from baseline value in 20 and 30\u00a0min post stimulation (P\u00a0>\u00a00.005). CONCLUSION: Reducing stimulation electrode size to one third of the conventional one results in spatially more focused stimulation and increases the efficacy of a-tDCS for induction of larger corticospinal excitability. This may be due to the fact that larger electrodes stimulate nearby cortical functional areas which can have inhibitory effects on primary motor cortex.", "pages": "e62219"}]
