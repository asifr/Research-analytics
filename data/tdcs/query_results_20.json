When a definitive lack of responsiveness to conservative treatments is ascertained and medication overuse headache is excluded, neuromodulation options can be considered in selected cases.Here, the various invasive and non-invasive approaches, such as hypothalamic deep brain stimulation, occipital nerve stimulation, stimulation of sphenopalatine ganglion, cervical spinal cord stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are extensively published although proper RCT-based evidence is limited. The European Headache Federation herewith provides a consensus statement on the clinical use of neuromodulation in headache, based on theoretical background, clinical data, and side effect of each method. This international consensus further gives recommendations for future studies on these new approaches.In spite of a growing field of stimulation devices in headaches treatment, further controlled studies to validate, strengthen and disseminate the use of neurostimulation are clearly warranted. Consequently, until these data are available any neurostimulation device should only be used in patients with medically intractable syndromes from tertiary headache centers either as part of a valid study or have shown to be effective in such controlled studies with an acceptable side effect profile.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Putative physiological mechanisms underlying tDCS analgesic effects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24133434", "authors": ["Knotkova, H", "Nitsche, MA", "Cruciani, RA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "In this study, we explored the representation of an incongruent action (instrumentally incorrect use of an object) in comparison with sentences ending with an incongruent action word, taking into account the role of the activation of the left dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC). This activity was appositely modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The effect of tDCS when participants processed congruent/incongruent object-related actions (Experiment 1) or sentences (Experiment 2) was verified by measuring changes in the ERP N400, error rates (ERs), and RTs. In Experiment 1, 30 participants performed the detection task within a dynamic context (video tapes representing a sequence of four action frames). In Experiment 2, 28 participants read sentences that represented object-related actions. The stimulation effect (a cathode applied to the DLPFC and an anode to the right supraorbital region) was analyzed by comparing the ER, RT, and ERP profiles before and after stimulation (or sham treatment). A significant reduction of the N400 was observed for incongruent stimuli in the case of cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation of the DLPFC in comparison with prestimulation conditions for Experiment 1, but not Experiment 2. Moreover, ERs were increased, and RTs were reduced in response to incongruent conditions after tDCS, but not after sham stimulation in Experiment 1. It is suggested that perturbation of the DLPFC may limit the ability to analyze a semantically anomalous action sequence as a reduced N400 ERP effect and increased random responses was observed.

This is particularly relevant for major depressive disorder, the most common psychiatric disorder in the general hospital. In this context, nonpharmacological interventions could be useful therapies; and, among those, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) might be an interesting option. The main methods of NIBS are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which was recently approved as a nonresearch treatment for some psychiatric conditions, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique that is currently limited to research scenarios but has shown promising results. Therefore, our aim was to review the main medical conditions associated with high depression rates, the main obstacles for depression treatment, and whether these therapies could be a useful intervention for such conditions. We found that depression is an important and prevalent comorbidity in a variety of diseases such as epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, myocardial infarction, cancer, and in other conditions such as pregnancy and in patients without enteral access. We found that treatment of depression is often suboptimal within the above contexts and that rTMS and tDCS therapies have been insufficiently appraised. We discuss whether rTMS and tDCS could have a significant impact in treating depression that develops within a clinical context, considering its unique characteristics such as the absence of pharmacological interactions, the use of a nonenteral route, and as an augmentation therapy for antidepressants.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on risky decision making are mediated by 'hot' and 'cold' decisions, personality, and hemisphere.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24124667", "authors": ["Pripfl, J", "Neumann, R", "K\u00f6hler, U", "Lamm, C"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the latest neurorehabilitation literature for motor recovery in stroke and traumatic brain injury to assist clinical decision making and assessing future research directions.", "pages": ""}]
