Strong evidence implicates intracortical mechanisms in this depression. As well as evoking MEPs in contralateral muscles, TMS also reduces MEPs evoked in ipsilateral muscles through interhemispheric inhibition mediated by a transcallosal pathway. Here we have sought to determine whether this effect is also depressed after exercise. Using two magnetic stimulators, the aftereffects of unilateral hand muscle exercise on the ability of TMS delivered to the hemisphere that generated the exercise were examined to i) generate MEPs in the exercised hand muscles, and ii) depress MEPs evoked by TMS pulses in contralateral (non-exercised) hand muscles. After exercise there was a significant reduction in the amplitudes of MEPs evoked by TMS in the exercised muscles ( p<0.001). However, the same stimuli remained able to depress responses evoked by TMS to the contralateral hemisphere in the non-exercised muscles as effectively as before the exercise. We conclude that unlike the MEPs evoked by corticospinal output, interhemispheric inhibition evoked from the hemisphere that generated the exercise is not depressed after exercise. A similar differential effect on interhemispheric inhibition and corticospinal output has been reported recently for the effects of transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation of the motor cortex. Fatiguing exercise and transcranial DC stimulation may therefore engage similar intracortical mechanisms.", "pages": "530-6"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation disrupts tactile perception.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "15245504", "authors": ["Rogalewski, A", "Breitenstein, C", "Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W", "Knecht, S"], "year": "2004", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "The excitability of the cerebral cortex can be modulated by various transcranial stimulation techniques. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) offers the advantage of portable equipment and could, therefore, be used for ambulatory modulation of brain excitability. However, modulation of cortical excitability by tDCS has so far mostly been shown by indirect measures. Therefore, we examined whether tDCS has a direct behavioral/perceptional effect. We compared tactile discrimination of vibratory stimuli to the left ring finger prior to, during and after tDCS applied for 7 min at 1-mA current intensity in 13 subjects. Stimulation was pseudorandomized into cathodal, anodal and sham conditions in a within-subject design. The active electrode was placed over the corresponding somatosensory cortex at C4 according to the 10-20 EEG system and the reference electrode at the forehead above the contralateral orbita. Cathodal stimulation compared with sham induced a prolonged decrease of tactile discrimination, while anodal and sham stimulation did not. Thus, cortical processing can be modulated in a behaviorally/perceptually meaningful way by weak transcranial current stimulation applied through portable technology. This finding offers a new perspective for the treatment of conditions characterized by alterations of cortical excitability.", "pages": "530-6"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Consolidation of human motor cortical neuroplasticity by D-cycloserine.", "keywords": [], "issue": "8", "pmid": "15199378", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Jaussi, W", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "D-Cycloserine (CYC), a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist, has been shown to improve cognitive functions in humans.

We studied the impact of this drug on long-lasting after-effects of transcranial direct current (tDCS)-generated motor cortical excitability shifts, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited motor-evoked potentials. While anodal tDCS enhances motor cortical excitability, cathodal tDCS diminishes it. Both effects seem to be NMDA receptor dependent. D-CYC selectively potentiated the duration of motor cortical excitability enhancements induced by anodal tDCS. D-CYC alone did not modulate excitability.

An increase in high frequency oscillatory activity in the beta and gamma frequency ranges is closely related in time to the N70 peak of the primary visual evoked potential (VEP), which is an early sensory component of visual activation. Therefore this potential can be used to observe tDCS-induced changes related to oscillatory activity. VEPs were recorded using sinusoidal luminance gratings in an on/off mode before, immediately after and 10, 20, 30 min after the end of 10 min anodal or cathodal stimulation. Cathodal stimulation significantly decreased while anodal stimulation slightly increased the normalized beta and gamma frequency powers.

To pursue this we increased or decreased the excitability of MT+/V5, primary motor, and primary visual cortex by the application of 7 min of anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy human subjects while they were performing a visuomotor tracking task involving hand movements. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased specifically during and immediately after cathodal stimulation, which decreases cortical excitability, only when V5 was stimulated. None of the other stimulation conditions affected visuomotor performance. We propose that the improvement in performance caused by cathodal tDCS of V5 is due to a focusing effect on to the complex motion perception conditions involved in this task. This hypothesis was proven by additional experiments: Testing simple and complex motion perception in dot kinetograms, we found that a diminution in excitability induced by cathodal stimulation improved the subject's perception of the direction of the coherent motion only if this was presented among random dots (complex motion perception), and worsened it if only one motion direction was presented (simple movement perception).

However, so far not much is known about the underlying physiological mechanisms. Here, we study the impact of amphetamine on NMDA receptor-dependent long-lasting excitability modifications in the human motor cortex elicited by weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Amphetamine significantly enhanced and prolonged increases in anodal, tDCS-induced, long-lasting excitability. Under amphetamine premedication, anodal tDCS resulted in an enhancement of excitability which lasted until the morning after tDCS, compared to approximately 1 h in the placebo condition. Prolongation of the excitability enhancement was most pronounced for long-term effects; the duration of short-term excitability enhancement was only slightly increased. Since the additional application of the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane blocked any enhancement of tDCS-driven excitability under amphetamine, we conclude that amphetamine consolidates the tDCS-induced neuroplastic effects, but does not initiate them. The fact that propanolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, diminished the duration of the tDCS-generated after-effects suggests that adrenergic receptors play a certain role in the consolidation of NMDA receptor-dependent motor cortical excitability modifications in humans.

To further elucidate a potential subcortical influence on motor effects, we combined TMS and unilateral subcortical electrical stimulation (SES) of the corticospinal tract. SES was performed through implanted depth electrodes in eight patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe dystonia. Chronaxie, conduction velocity (CV) of the stimulated fibres and poststimulus time histograms of single motor unit recordings were calculated to provide evidence of an activation of large diameter myelinated fibres by SES. Excitatory and inhibitory motor effects recorded bilaterally from the first dorsal interosseus muscle were measured after SES and focal TMS of the motor cortex. This allowed us to compare motor effects of subcortical (direct) and cortical (mainly indirect) activation of corticospinal neurons. SES activated a fast conducting monosynaptic pathway to the alpha motoneuron. Motor responses elicited by SES had significantly shorter onset latency and shorter duration of the contralateral silent period compared to TMS induced motor effects. Spinal excitability as assessed by H-reflex was significantly reduced during the silent period after SES. No ipsilateral motor effects could be elicited by SES while TMS was followed by an ipsilateral inhibition. The results suggest that SES activated the corticospinal neurons at the level of the internal capsule. Comparison of SES and TMS induced motor effects reveals that the first part of the TMS induced contralateral silent period should be of spinal origin while its later part is due to cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the ipsilateral inhibition is predominantly mediated via transcallosal pathways.", "pages": "530-6"}]
