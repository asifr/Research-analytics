Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective treatment approaches. Functional imaging studies in patients with tinnitus have revealed alterations in neuronal activity of central auditory pathways, probably resulting as a consequence of sensory deafferentation. However, nonauditory brain areas are also involved. These nonauditory brain areas might represent both an \"awareness\" network involved in the conscious perception of the tinnitus signal as well as areas related to a nontinnitus-specific distress network consisting of the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala. Moreover, memory mechanisms involving the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region may play a role in the persistence of the awareness of the phantom percept, as well as in the reinforcement of the associated distress. All of these networks represent potential targets for treatment via pharmacological treatment or noninvasive and invasive brain stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method of applying electromagnetic fields to the brain that can induce alterations of neuronal activity that outlast the stimulation period. Single sessions of rTMS over the temporal or temporoparietal cortex have been successful in transiently reducing tinnitus perception. Repeated sessions of rTMS have resulted in tinnitus relief in a subgroup of patients, lasting from several days to several months. However, effect sizes of rTMS in the treatment of tinnitus are only moderate, and interindividual variability is high. Larger and longer lasting effects have been observed with direct electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex via implanted epidural electrodes. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has also shown potential for the treatment of tinnitus. Both auditory and frontal tDCS have shown tinnitus reduction in a subgroup of patients. In spite of the promising results of the different brain stimulation approaches, further research is needed before these techniques can be recommended for routine clinical use.", "pages": "441-67"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Pain.", "keywords": ["chronic pain", "epidural cortical stimulation", "motor cortex", "neuromodulation", "neuropathic pain", "noninvasive brain stimulation", "prefrontal cortex", "refractory pain", "repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation", "transcranial direct current stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24112914", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "Invasive stimulation of the motor (precentral) cortex using surgically implanted epidural electrodes is indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain that is refractory to medical treatment. Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS), but MCS outcome remains variable and validated criteria for selecting good candidates for implantation are lacking. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive approach that could be used as a preoperative tool to predict MCS outcome and also could serve as a therapeutic procedure in itself to treat pain disorders. This requires repeated rTMS sessions and a maintenance protocol. Other studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in relieving chronic pain syndromes. The most studied target is the precentral cortex, but other targets, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortices, could be of interest. The analgesic effects of cortical stimulation relate to the activation of various circuits modulating neural activities in remote structures, such as the thalamus, limbic cortex, insula, or descending inhibitory controls. In addition to the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain by epidural MCS, new developments of this type of strategy are ongoing, for other types of pain syndrome and stimulation techniques.", "pages": "441-67"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Physics of effects of transcranial brain stimulation.", "keywords": ["TMS", "anisotropy", "brain stimulation", "electric field", "focality", "heterogeneity", "spatial distribution", "tDCS", "transcranial direct current stimulation", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24112908", "authors": ["Miranda, PC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "abstract": "The effects of transcranial stimulation are determined to a large extent by the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the electric field produced in the brain.

Although many studies have demonstrated that tDCS can effectively modulate excitability of various brain sites, the outcomes of the tDCS treatment are not consistent among subjects to whom identical electrode montages were applied. So far, no studies have clearly elucidated the main cause of this individual variability. The hypothesis of our study was that the individual variability in the tDCS effect might be originated due to the anatomical differences among subjects. To verify our hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between the current density value at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) simulated using finite element method (FEM) and the behavioral outcomes of a simple working memory (WM) task. A 3-back WM task experiment was conducted with twenty-five healthy subjects before and after the DC stimulation, when the cathode and anode electrodes were attached to right supraorbital area and F3 location, respectively, for all subjects. The results showed that participants who showed enhanced WM task performance after tDCS had a significantly larger current density on DLPFC, suggesting that the inconsistent behavioral outcomes of tDCS might be partially due to the anatomical differences among subjects.", "pages": "441-67"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Predicting the behavioral impact of transcranial direct current stimulation: issues and limitations.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24109445", "authors": ["de Berker, AO", "Bikson, M", "Bestmann, S"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Planar electrodes are increasingly used in a variety of neural stimulation techniques such as epidural spinal cord stimulation, epidural cortical stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and functional electric stimulation. Recently, optimized electrode geometries have been shown to increase the efficiency of neural stimulation by maximizing the variation of current density on the electrode surface. In the present work, a new family of modified fractal electrode geometries is developed to increase the neural activation function and enhance the efficiency of neural stimulation. It is hypothesized that the key factor in increasing the activation function in the tissue adjacent to the electrode is to increase the \"edginess\" of the electrode surface, a concept that is explained and quantified by fractal mathematics. Rigorous finite element simulations were performed to compute the distribution of electric potential produced by proposed geometries, demonstrating that the neural activation function was significantly enhanced in the tissue. The activation of 800 model axons positioned around the electrodes was also quantified, showing that modified fractal geometries yielded a 22% reduction in input power consumption while maintaining the same level of neural activation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of increasing stimulation efficiency using modified fractal geometries beyond the levels already reported in the literature.", "pages": "441-67"}]
