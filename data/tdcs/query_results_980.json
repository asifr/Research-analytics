The aim of this paper is to summarize the partially adverse effects of 567 tDCS sessions over motor and non-motor cortical areas (occipital, temporal, parietal) from the last 2 years, on work performed in our laboratories. One-hundred and two of our subjects who participated in our tDCS studies completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes, during and after tDCS. Participants were healthy subjects (75.5%), migraine patients (8.8%), post-stroke patients (5.9%) and tinnitus patients (9.8%). During tDCS a mild tingling sensation was the most common reported adverse effect (70.6%), moderate fatigue was felt by 35.3% of the subjects, whereas a light itching sensation under the stimulation electrodes occurred in 30.4% of cases. After tDCS headache (11.8%), nausea (2.9%) and insomnia (0.98%) were reported, but fairly infrequently. In addition, the incidence of the itching sensation (p=0.02) and the intensity of tingling sensation (p=0.02) were significantly higher during tDCS in the group of the healthy subjects, in comparison to patients; whereas the occurrence of headache was significantly higher in the patient group (p=0.03) after the stimulation. Our results suggest that tDCS applied to motor and non-motor areas according to the present tDCS safety guidelines, is associated with relatively minor adverse effects in healthy humans and patients with varying neurological disorders.", "pages": "9-15"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Perception of comfort during transcranial DC stimulation: effect of NaCl solution concentration applied to sponge electrodes.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17329167", "authors": ["Dundas, JE", "Thickbroom, GW", "Mastaglia, FL"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is valuable in research and has potential therapeutic applications in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, psychiatry, and neurology.

Following demonstration of disruption of performance on psychological tasks closely linked to cingulate function using this TMS technique, the current study aimed to directly measure the regional distribution of physiological effects of stimulation in the brain with H2(15)O PET. Experiment 1 assessed the effect of increasing numbers of pulse trains of TMS on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Experiment 2 assessed the capacity of medial frontal TMS to modulate brain activity associated with the Stroop task using medial parietal TMS as a control site of stimulation. SPM99 analyses, using the ACC as a region of interest, revealed clusters of increased rCBF during medial frontal TMS in Brodmann area 24 and reduced rCBF in more ventral ACC, the latter occurring in both experiments. In a whole-brain analysis, striking changes in rCBF were observed distal to the ACC following medial frontal TMS. Although TMS reliably affected Stroop task performance in early trials, there was no interaction between TMS and Stroop condition in rCBF. Our results suggest that medial frontal TMS using the double-cone coil can affect ACC activity. However, a number of more distal cortical areas were also affected in these experiments. These additional changes may reflect either 'downstream' effects of altered cingulate cortex activity or direct effects of the coil.", "pages": "9-15"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Recent advances in the treatment of chronic pain with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.", "keywords": [], "issue": "2", "pmid": "17239806", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Freedman, S", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Associative neuroplasticity, which encompasses the modification of synaptic strength by coactivation of two synaptic inputs, has been linked to learning processes. Because unlimited plasticity destabilizes neuronal networks, homeostatic rules were proposed and experimentally proven that control for the amount and direction of plasticity dependent on background network activity. Accordingly, low background activity would enhance facilitatory plasticity, whereas high background activity would inhibit it. However, the impact of background excitability on associative plasticity has not been studied so far in humans. Facilitatory associative plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS) in the human motor cortex, whereas background activity was enhanced or diminished by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). When applied before PAS, excitability-enhancing tDCS also boosted the efficacy of PAS, whereas excitability-diminishing tDCS turned it into inhibition. Thus, previous background activity does not influence associative plasticity homeostatically. When tDCS and PAS were applied simultaneously, now in accordance with homeostatic rules of neuroplasticity, reduced background activity resulted in a prolonged excitability enhancement by PAS, whereas enhanced background activity turned it into inhibition. We conclude that background network activity can influence associative plasticity homeostatically. However, only simultaneous modulation of both parameters is in accordance with homeostatic concepts. These findings might be of importance for the development of plasticity-inducing stimulation protocols supporting information processing in humans.", "pages": "9-15"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Motor cortex abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with transcranial direct-current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "5", "pmid": "17221883", "authors": ["Quartarone, A", "Lang, N", "Rizzo, V", "Bagnato, S", "Morgante, F", "Sant'angelo, A", "Crupi, D", "Battaglia, F", "Messina, C", "Girlanda, P"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "Interest in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in clinical practice has been growing, however, the knowledge about its efficacy and mechanisms of action remains limited.
