Although shifts on focal brain excitability have been proposed to explain the clinical effects of tDCS, how tDCS-induced functional changes influence cortical interneurones is still largely unknown. The assessment of short latency afferent inhibition (SLAI) of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), provides the opportunity to test non-invasively interneuronal cholinergic circuits in the human motor cortex. The aim of the present study was to assess whether anodal tDCS can modulate interneuronal circuits involved in SLAI. Resting motor threshold (RMT), amplitude of unconditioned MEPs and SLAI were assessed in the dominant hemisphere of 12 healthy subjects (aged 21-37) before and after anodal tDCS (primary motor cortex, 13min, 1mA). SLAI was assessed delivering electrical conditioning stimuli to the median nerve at the wrist prior to test TMS given at the interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2ms. Whereas RMT and the amplitude of unconditioned MEPs did not change after anodal tDCS, SLAI significantly increased. In conclusion, anodal tDCS-induced effects depend also on the modulation of cortical interneuronal circuits. The enhancement of cortical cholinergic activity assessed by SLAI could be an important mechanism explaining anodal tDCS action in several pathological conditions.", "pages": "167-70"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Basic knowledge of transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "21591542", "authors": ["Auvichayapat, P", "Auvichayapat, N"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was a neurophysiologic technique using weak electrical currents (1-2 mA) to modulate the activity of neurons in the brain.

Reach adaptation in force fields has generalization patterns that suggest primary engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the intrinsic coordinates of joints and muscles, and lesser engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the extrinsic coordinates of the task. Among the cortical motor areas, the intrinsic coordinate system is most prominently represented in the primary sensorimotor cortices. Here, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to alter mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and found that when it was applied to the motor cortex, it increased generalization in intrinsic coordinates but not extrinsic coordinates. However, when tDCS was applied to the posterior parietal cortex, it had no effects on learning or generalization in the force field task. The results suggest that during force field adaptation, the component of learning that produces generalization in intrinsic coordinates depends on the plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex.", "pages": "167-70"}, {"volume": "497", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation influences the cardiac autonomic nervous control.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19788568", "authors": ["Montenegro, RA", "Farinatti, Pde T", "Fontes, EB", "Soares, PP", "Cunha, FA", "Gurgel, JL", "Porto, F", "Cyrino, ES", "Okano, AH"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that induces changes in cortical excitability: anodal stimulation increases while cathodal stimulation reduces excitability. Imaging studies performed after unilateral stimulation have shown conflicting results regarding the effects of tDCS on surrogate markers of neuronal activity. The aim of this study was to directly measure these effects on activation-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow (\u0394rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during bilateral tDCS. Nine healthy subjects underwent repeated rCBF measurements with (15)O-water and PET during a simple motor task while receiving tDCS or sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also assessed before and after real and sham stimulation. During tDCS with active movement, \u0394rCBF in M1 was significantly lower on the cathodal than the anodal side when compared with sham stimulation. This decrease in \u0394rCBF was accompanied by a decrease in MEP amplitude on the cathodal side. No effect was observed on resting or activated rCBF relative to sham stimulation. We thus conclude that it is the interaction of cathodal tDCS with activation-induced \u0394rCBF rather than the effect on resting or activated rCBF itself which constitutes the physiological imaging correlate of tDCS.", "pages": "167-70"}, {"volume": "185", "title": "Flash visual evoked potentials in mice can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19528092", "authors": ["Cambiaghi, M", "Teneud, L", "Velikova, S", "Gonzalez-Rosa, JJ", "Cursi, M", "Comi, G", "Leocani, L"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that the integrity of ipsilesional and inter-hemispheric motor circuits is important for motor recovery after stroke. However, the extent to which each of these tracts contributes to the variance in outcome remains unclear. We examined whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived measures of corticospinal and transcallosal tracts predict motor improvement in an experimental neurorehabilitation trial. 15 chronic stroke patients received bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation and simultaneous physical/occupational therapy for five consecutive days. Motor impairment was assessed prior to and after the intervention. At baseline, the patients underwent DTI; probabilistic fiber tracking was used to reconstruct the pyramidal tract (PT), alternate descending motor fibers (aMF), and transcallosal fibers connecting primary motor cortices (M1-M1). Ipsilesional corticospinal tracts (PT, aMF) and M1-M1 showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased directional diffusivities when compared to age-matched healthy controls. Partial correlations revealed that greater gains in motor function were related to higher FA values and lower directional diffusivities of transcallosal and ipsilesional corticospinal tracts. M1-M1 diffusivity had the greatest predictive value. An additional slice-by-slice analysis of FA values along the corticospinal tracts demonstrated that the more the ipsilesional FA profiles of patients resembled those of healthy controls, the greater their functional improvement. In conclusion, our study shows that DTI-derived measures can be used to predict functional potential for subsequent motor recovery in chronic stroke patients. Diffusivity parameters of individual tracts and tract combinations may help in assessing a patient's individual recovery potential and in determining optimal neurorehabilitative interventions.", "pages": "167-70"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improves selective muscle activation in the ipsilateral arm.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "19945398", "authors": ["McCambridge, AB", "Bradnam, LV", "Stinear, CM", "Byblow, WD"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) trials - investigating either non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions - have shown mixed results. Many reasons explain this heterogeneity, but one that stands out is the trial design due to specific challenges in the field. We aimed therefore to review the methodology of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) trials and provide a framework to improve clinical trial design. We performed a systematic review for randomized, controlled MDD trials whose intervention was transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in MEDLINE and other databases from April 2002 to April 2008. We created an unstructured checklist based on CONSORT guidelines to extract items such as power analysis, sham method, blinding assessment, allocation concealment, operational criteria used for MDD, definition of refractory depression and primary study hypotheses. Thirty-one studies were included. We found that the main methodological issues can be divided in to three groups: (1) issues related to phase II/small trials, (2) issues related to MDD trials and, (3) specific issues of NIBS studies. Taken together, they can threaten study validity and lead to inconclusive results. Feasible solutions include: estimating the sample size a priori; measuring the degree of refractoriness of the subjects; specifying the primary hypothesis and statistical tests; controlling predictor variables through stratification randomization methods or using strict eligibility criteria; adjusting the study design to the target population; using adaptive designs and exploring NIBS efficacy employing biological markers. In conclusion, our study summarizes the main methodological issues of NIBS trials and proposes a number of alternatives to manage them.", "pages": "167-70"}]
