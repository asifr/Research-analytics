Although its development has been slow, current advances in the techniques of brain stimulation have improved its clinical efficacy. The use of non-invasive brain stimulation has significant advantages, such as not involving surgical procedures and having relatively mild adverse effects. In this paper we briefly review the use of 2 non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), as therapeutic approaches in physical and rehabilitation medicine. We also compare the effects of non-invasive central nervous system stimulation with techniques of non-invasive peripheral electrical stimulation, in order to provide new insights for future developments. Although the outcomes of these initial trials include some conflicting results, the evidence supports that rTMS and tDCS might have a therapeutic value in different neurological conditions. Studies published within the last year have examined new approaches of stimulation, such as longer intensities of stimulation, new electrode sizes for tDCS, novel coils for stimulation of deeper areas, and new frequencies of stimulation for rTMS. These new approaches need to be tested in larger clinical trials in order to determine whether they offer significant clinical effects.", "pages": "305-11"}, {"volume": "219", "title": "Treatment of depression with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): a review.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19348793", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Boggio, PS", "Fregni, F", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is usually accompanied by alterations of cortical activity and excitability, especially in prefrontal areas. These are reflections of a dysfunction in a distributed cortico-subcortical, bihemispheric network. Therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that altering this pathological state with techniques of brain stimulation may offer a therapeutic target. Besides repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, tonic stimulation with weak direct currents (tDCS) modulates cortical excitability for hours after the end of stimulation, thus, it is a promising non-invasive therapeutic option. Early studies from the 1960s suggested some efficacy of DC stimulation to reduce symptoms in depression, but mixed results and development of psychotropic drugs resulted in an early abandonment of this technique. In the last years tDCS protocols have been optimized. Application of the newly developed stimulation protocols in patients with major depression has shown promise in few pilot studies. Further studies are needed to identify the optimal parameters of stimulation and the clinical and patient characteristics that may condition response to tDCS.", "pages": "305-11"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of major depression: insights from past and recent clinical studies.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "19339889", "authors": ["Murphy, DN", "Boggio, P", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current opinion in psychiatry", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive method of brain stimulation that has been increasingly tested for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. It has useful characteristics, such as low cost, ease of use, reliable sham methodology, and relatively powerful effects on cortical excitability. Because of its potential to modulate cortical excitability noninvasively, tDCS has been tested for the treatment of depression for several decades. Therefore, we reviewed evidence on the use of tDCS for major depression examining evidence from past and recent tDCS studies.

Reducing neuronal excitability is a common target of antiepileptic therapies.

Hereby, noninvasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have gained increased interest as efficient tools to modulate cortical excitability and activity. In animal models, stimulation-induced cortical excitability diminution has been shown to be suited to reduce seizures. Clinical studies conducted to date, however, have shown mixed results.
