Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising approach for improving motor learning. The aim of this trial was to test the hypothesis that dual-tDCS applied bilaterally over the primary motor cortices (M1) improves online motor skill learning with the paretic hand and its long-term retention. Methods: Eighteen chronic stroke patients participated in a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled, double bind trial. During separate sessions, dual-tDCS or sham dual-tDCS was applied over 30\u2009min while stroke patients learned a complex visuomotor skill with the paretic hand: using a computer mouse to move a pointer along a complex circuit as quickly and accurately as possible. A learning index involving the evolution of the speed/accuracy trade-off was calculated. Performance of the motor skill was measured at baseline, after intervention and 1\u2009week later. Results: After sham dual-tDCS, eight patients showed performance worsening. In contrast, dual-tDCS enhanced the amount and speed of online motor skill learning compared to sham (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in all patients; this superiority was maintained throughout the hour following. The speed/accuracy trade-off was shifted more consistently after dual-tDCS (n\u2009=\u200910) than after sham (n\u2009=\u20093). More importantly, 1\u2009week later, online enhancement under dual-tDCS had translated into superior long-term retention (+44%) compared to sham (+4%). The improvement generalized to a new untrained circuit and to digital dexterity. Conclusion: A single-session of dual-tDCS, applied while stroke patients trained with the paretic hand significantly enhanced online motor skill learning both quantitatively and qualitatively, leading to successful long-term retention and generalization. The combination of motor skill learning and dual-tDCS is promising for improving post-stroke neurorehabilitation.", "pages": "621-2"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Neurobiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation: a review.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "19788568", "authors": ["Medeiros, LF", "de Souza, IC", "Vidor, LP", "de Souza, A", "Deitos, A", "Volz, MS", "Fregni, F", "Caumo, W", "Torres, IL"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "abstract": "Tinnitus is an auditory phantom percept with a tone, hissing, or buzzing sound in the absence of any objective physical sound source. Two forms of low-intensity cranial electrical stimulation exist for clinical and research purposes: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In a recent study, it was demonstrated that a single session of tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (anode over right DLPFC) yields a transient improvement in subjects with chronic tinnitus and that repeated sessions can possibly be used as a treatment. In the present study, the effect of a single-session individual alpha-modulated tACS and tDCS applied at the DLPFC bilaterally is compared with tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance. A total of fifty tinnitus patients were selected and randomly assigned to the tACS or tDCS treatment. Our main result was that bifrontal tDCS modulates tinnitus annoyance and tinnitus loudness, whereas individual alpha-modulated tACS does not yield a similar result. This study provides additional insights into the role of DLPFC in tinnitus modulation as well as the intersection between tinnitus and affective/attentional processing.", "pages": "621-2"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "A feasibility study assessing cortical plasticity in chronic neuropathic pain following burn injury.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "19885654", "authors": ["Portilla, AS", "Bravo, GL", "Miraval, FK", "Villamar, MF", "Schneider, JC", "Ryan, CM", "Fregni, F"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of combined therapy using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with robot-assisted arm training (AT) for impairment of the upper limb in chronic stroke patients, and to clarify whether differences exist in the effect of anodal tDCS on the affected hemisphere (tDCS(a)\u2009+\u2009AT) and cathodal tDCS on the unaffected hemisphere (tDCS(c)\u2009+\u2009AT).", "pages": "621-2"}, {"volume": "225", "title": "Opposite effects of weak transcranial direct current stimulation on different phases of short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI).", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "20434997", "authors": ["Cengiz, B", "Murase, N", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
