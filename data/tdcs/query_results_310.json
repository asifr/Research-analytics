However, less is known about its impact on specific intracortical inhibitory mechanisms, such as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB)-mediated inhibition. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of anodal and cathodal tDCS on M1 intracortical inhibition in healthy individuals. Long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP) duration, both presumably mediated by GABAB receptors, were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately before and after a 20 min session of tDCS over the left M1. Anodal tDCS significantly enhanced motor evoked potential size and reduced CSP duration, whereas it had no effect on LICI. Cathodal stimulation did not significantly modulate motor evoked potential size, CSP duration or LICI. This study provides evidence that anodal tDCS, presumably by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, has a direct effect on GABAB-meditated inhibition assessed by the CSP, but not by LICI. Our results further suggest that CSP and LICI probe distinct intracortical inhibitory mechanisms as they are differentially modulated by anodal tDCS. Finally, these data may have clinical value in patients in whom a pathological increase in CSP duration is present, such as schizophrenia.", "pages": "46-50"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Therapeutic interventions for aphasia initiated more than six months post stroke: a review of the evidence.", "keywords": ["Benzodiazepines", "Bipolar disorder", "Major depressive disorder", "Serotonin uptake inhibitors", "Transcranial direct current stimulation"], "issue": "6", "pmid": "23192717", "authors": ["Allen, L", "Mehta, S", "McClure, JA", "Teasell, R"], "year": "", "journal": "Topics in stroke rehabilitation", "abstract": "Aphasia effects up to 38% of acute stroke patients.

Traditional neurorehabilitation strategies aimed at restoring function to weakened limbs provide only modest benefit. New brain stimulation techniques designed to augment traditional neurorehabilitation hold promise for reducing the burden of stroke-related disability. Investigators discovered that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) can enhance neural plasticity in the motor cortex post-stroke. Improved outcomes may be obtained with activity-dependent stimulation, in which brain stimulation is contingent on neural or muscular activity during normal behavior. We review the evidence for improved motor function in stroke patients treated with rTMS, tDCS, and ECS and discuss the mediating physiological mechanisms.

A small number of studies suggested that tDCS modulates the response to experimental pain paradigms. No trials have been conducted to evaluate the response of patients already suffering from pain, to an additional experimental pain before and after tDCS. The present study investigated the effect of a single session of anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation (15 mins/1 mA) over the primary motor cortex on the perceived intensity of repeated noxious thermal and electrical stimuli and on elements of quantitative sensory testing (thermal pain and perception thresholds) applied to the right hand in 15 patients with chronic low back pain. The study was conducted in a double-blind sham-controlled and cross-over design. No significant alterations of pain ratings were found. Modalities of quantitative sensory testing remained equally unchanged. It is therefore hypothesized that a single 15 mins session of tDCS at 1 mA may not be sufficient to alter the perception of experimental pain and in patients with chronic pain. Further studies applying repetitive tDCS to patients with chronic pain are required to fully answer the question whether experimental pain perception may be influenced by tDCS over the motor cortex.", "pages": "46-50"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Could dual-hemisphere transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduce spasticity after stroke?", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "12206052", "authors": ["Vandermeeren, Y", "Lefebvre, S", "Desfontaines, P", "Laloux, P"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Acta neurologica Belgica", "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression affects at least 1-3% of the US population.
