Direct (D wave) and indirect (I wave) volleys of descending impulses in the pyramidal system result from motor cortex stimulation and determine the measured responses. The advantages and disadvantages of the electrical and the magnetic stimulating modalities are assessed. The increased latency produced by magnetic as opposed to electrical stimulation is considered. Present clinical applications are discussed. The safety record is encouraging, but has aspects that must be addressed. Potential problems of the interpretation of motor evoked potentials in patients with central nervous system disease are emphasized in light of the pathophysiological mechanism underlying these potentials.", "pages": "199-203"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Motor evoked potentials from transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "6090972", "authors": ["Levy, WJ", "York, DH", "McCaffrey, M", "Tanzer, F"], "year": "1984", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Electrical monitoring of the motor system offers the potential for the detection of injury, the diagnosis of disease, the evaluation of treatment, and the prediction of recovery from damage. Existing evoked potentials monitor one or another sensory modality, but no generally usable motor monitor exists. We have reported a motor evoked potential using direct stimulation of the spinal cord over the motor tracts in cats and in humans. To achieve a less invasive monitor, we used transcranial stimulation over the motor cortex in the cat, thus stimulating the motor cortex. We report here the initial application of this method to humans. A plate electrode over the motor cortex on the scalp and a second electrode on the palate direct a mild current through the motor cortex which will activate the motor pathways. This signal can be recorded over the spinal cord. It can elicit contralateral peripheral nerve and electromyographic signals in the limbs or movements when the appropriate stimulation parameters are used. In clinical use to date, this has been more reliable than the somatosensory evoked potential in predicting motor function in patients where the two tests differed. It offers a number of possibilities for the development of valuable brain and spinal cord monitoring techniques, but requires further animal studies and clinical experience. Studies to date have not demonstrated adverse effects, but evaluation is continuing.", "pages": "199-203"}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}]
