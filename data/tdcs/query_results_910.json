Despite significant improvements of acute stroke care, two thirds of stroke survivors have to cope with persisting neurologic deficits. Adjuvant brain stimulation is a novel approach to improving the treatment of residual deficits after stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and epidural electrical stimulation have been used in first trials on small cohorts of stroke patients. Effect sizes in the order of 8% to 30% of functional improvement have been reported, but a publication bias toward presenting \"promising\" but not negative results is likely. Many questions regarding underlying mechanisms, optimal stimulation parameters, combination with other types of interventions, among others, are open. This review addresses six controversies related to the experimental application of brain stimulation techniques to stroke patients. Cortical stimulation after stroke will need to be individually tailored and a thorough patient stratification according to type and extent of clinical deficit, lesion location, lesion size, comorbidities, time in the recovery process, and perhaps also age and gender will be necessary. There is consensus that cortical stimulation in stroke patients is still experimental and should only be applied in the frame of scientific studies.", "pages": "370-82"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Consensus: Can transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation enhance motor learning and memory formation?", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20633394", "authors": ["Reis, J", "Robertson, EM", "Krakauer, JW", "Rothwell, J", "Marshall, L", "Gerloff, C", "Wassermann, EM", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Hummel, F", "Celnik, PA", "Classen, J", "Floel, A", "Ziemann, U", "Paulus, W", "Siebner, HR", "Born, J", "Cohen, LG"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation has developed as a promising tool for cognitive neuroscientists. Transcranial magnetic (TMS) and direct current (tDCS) stimulation allow researchers to purposefully enhance or decrease excitability in focal areas of the brain. The purpose of this article is to review information on the use of TMS and tDCS as research tools to facilitate motor memory formation, motor performance, and motor learning in healthy volunteers. Studies implemented so far have mostly focused on the ability of TMS and tDCS to elicit relatively short-lasting motor improvements and the mechanisms underlying these changes have been only partially investigated. Despite limitations, including the scarcity of data, work that has been already accomplished raises the exciting hypothesis that currently available noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques could modulate motor learning and memory formation in healthy humans and potentially in patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.", "pages": "370-82"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to relieve pain.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20633392", "authors": ["Lefaucheur, JP", "Antal, A", "Ahdab, R", "Ciampi de Andrade, D", "Fregni, F", "Khedr, EM", "Nitsche, M", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Chronic pain resulting from injury of the peripheral or central nervous system may be associated with a significant dysfunction of extensive neural networks. Noninvasive stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be suitable to treat chronic pain as they can act on these networks by modulating neural activities not only in the stimulated area, but also in remote regions that are interconnected to the site of stimulation. Motor cortex was the first cortical target that was proved to be efficacious in chronic pain treatment. At present, significant analgesic effects were also shown to occur after the stimulation of other cortical targets (including prefrontal and parietal areas) in acute provoked pain, chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, or visceral pain. Therapeutic applications of rTMS in pain syndromes are limited by the short duration of the induced effects, but prolonged pain relief can be obtained by repeating rTMS sessions every day for several weeks. Recent tDCS studies also showed some effects on various types of chronic pain. We review the evidence to date of these two techniques of noninvasive brain stimulation for the treatment of pain.", "pages": "370-82"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation/transcranial direct current stimulation in cognitive neurorehabilitation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "20633391", "authors": ["Miniussi, C", "Cappa, SF", "Cohen, LG", "Floel, A", "Fregni, F", "Nitsche, MA", "Oliveri, M", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Paulus, W", "Priori, A", "Walsh, V"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are a common consequence of neurologic disease, in particular, of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders, and there is evidence that specific cognitive training may be effective in cognitive rehabilitation. Several investigations emphasize the fact that interacting with cortical activity, by means of cortical stimulation, can positively affect the short-term cognitive performance and improve the rehabilitation potential of neurologic patients. In this respect, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical stimulation may play a role in treating aphasia, unilateral neglect, and other cognitive disorders. Several possible mechanisms can account for the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive performance. They all reflect the potential of these methods to improve the subject's ability to relearn or to acquire new strategies for carrying out behavioral tasks. The responsible mechanisms remain unclear but they are most likely related to the activation of impeded pathways or inhibition of maladaptive responses. Modifications of the brain activity may assist relearning by facilitating local activity or by suppressing interfering activity from other brain areas. Notwithstanding the promise of these preliminary findings, to date no systematic application of these methods to neurorehabilitation research has been reported. Considering the potential benefit of these interventions, further studies taking into consideration large patient populations, long treatment periods, or the combination of different rehabilitation strategies are needed. Brain stimulation is indeed an exciting opportunity in the field of cognitive neurorehabilitation, which is clearly in need of further research.", "pages": "370-82"}, {"volume": "60", "title": "Myoinositol content in the human brain is modified by transcranial direct current stimulation in a matter of minutes: a 1H-MRS study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "18816828", "authors": ["Rango, M", "Cogiamanian, F", "Marceglia, S", "Barberis, B", "Arighi, A", "Biondetti, P", "Priori, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine : official journal of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine / Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine", "abstract": "Brain content of myoinositol (mI) has been shown to be altered in several neuropsychiatric conditions.

We studied two groups of five healthy subjects by (1)H-MRS: the first group was studied before and after both anodal and sham (placebo) tDCS over the right frontal lobe, and the second group was studied at the same intervals without undergoing either sham or anodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS induced a significant increase of mI content at 30 min after stimulation offset (141.5 +/- 16.7%, P < 0.001) below the stimulating electrode but not in distant regions, such as the visual cortex, whereas sham tDCS failed to induce changes in mI. Neither N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) nor the other metabolite contents changed after anodal or sham stimulation. (1)H-MRS represents a powerful tool to follow the regional effects of tDCS on brain mI and, possibly, on the related phosphoinositide system.", "pages": "370-82"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Should we treat auditory hallucinations with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation?

A range of electrotherapy paradigms have been investigated, but no consistent method has been indicated for reporting reproducible stimulation \"dosage.\" Anecdotal reports, case studies, and limited clinical trials with small numbers suggest that tDCS may be effective in treating some patients with depression, but methods for selecting the optimal stimulation parameters (\"dosage\") are not clear, and there is no conclusive indication that tDCS is an effective treatment for depression. Larger, controlled studies are necessary to determine its safety and efficacy in a clinical setting. If tDCS can be established as an effective treatment for depression, it would represent a particularly attractive electrotherapy option, as it is a relatively benign and affordable treatment modality. An accurate system for describing reproducible treatment parameters is essential so that further studies can yield evidence-based guidelines for the clinical use of transcranial current stimulation. Development of appropriate parameters requires a biophysical understanding of how electrotherapy affects brain function and should include different paradigms for different clinical applications. As with any dosage guidelines, such a system does not supersede physician judgment on safety.", "pages": "370-82"}]
