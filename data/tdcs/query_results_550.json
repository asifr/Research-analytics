However, traditional versions of 1 specific technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), stimulate broad regions of cortex with poor spatial precision. A new tDCS design, called high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), allows for focal delivery of the charge to discrete regions of the cortex. We sought to preliminarily test the safety and tolerability of the HD-tDCS technique as well as to evaluate whether HD-tDCS over the motor cortex would decrease pain and sensory experience. Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers underwent quantitative sensory testing before and after 20 minutes of real (n = 13) or sham (n = 11) 2 mA HD-tDCS over the motor cortex. No adverse events occurred and no side effects were reported. Real HD-tDCS was associated with significantly decreased heat and cold sensory thresholds, decreased thermal wind-up pain, and a marginal analgesic effect for cold pain thresholds. No significant effects were observed for mechanical pain thresholds or heat pain thresholds. HD-tDCS appears well tolerated, and produced changes in underlying cortex that are associated with changes in pain perception. Future studies are warranted to investigate HD-tDCS in other applications, and to examine further its potential to affect pain perception.", "pages": "112-20"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Enhanced cortical excitability in grapheme-color synesthesia and its modulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "23", "pmid": "22100060", "authors": ["Terhune, DB", "Tai, S", "Cowey, A", "Popescu, T", "Cohen Kadosh, R"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "abstract": "This article presents preliminary tolerability and efficacy data for a new focal brain stimulation technique called high definition transcranial direct current stimulation.

Previous research suggests that synesthetes display enhanced modality-specific perceptual processing, but it remains unclear whether enhanced processing contributes to conscious awareness of color photisms. In three experiments, we investigated whether grapheme-color synesthesia is characterized by enhanced cortical excitability in primary visual cortex and the role played by this hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that synesthetes display 3-fold lower phosphene thresholds than controls during stimulation of the primary visual cortex. We next used transcranial direct current stimulation to discriminate between two competing hypotheses of the role of hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. We demonstrate that synesthesia can be selectively augmented with cathodal stimulation and attenuated with anodal stimulation of primary visual cortex. A control task revealed that the effect of the brain stimulation was specific to the experience of synesthesia. These results indicate that hyperexcitability acts as a source of noise in visual cortex that influences the availability of the neuronal signals underlying conscious awareness of synesthetic photisms.", "pages": "112-20"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation--update 2011.", "keywords": [], "issue": "6", "pmid": "19419432", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "We investigated the effect of electrode area and inter-electrode distance on the spatial distribution of the current density in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). For this purpose, we used the finite element method to compute the distribution of the current density in a four-layered spherical head model using various electrode montages, corresponding to a range of electrode sizes and inter-electrode distances. We found that smaller electrodes required slightly less current to achieve a constant value of the current density at a reference point on the brain surface located directly under the electrode center. Under these conditions, smaller electrodes also produced a more focal current density distribution in the brain, i.e. the magnitude of the current density fell more rapidly with distance from the reference point. The combination of two electrodes with different areas produced an asymmetric current distribution that could lead to more effective and localized neural modulation under the smaller electrode than under the larger one. Focality improved rapidly with decreasing electrode size when the larger electrode sizes were considered but the improvement was less marked for the smaller electrode sizes. Also, focality was not affected significantly by inter-electrode distance unless two large electrodes were placed close together. Increasing the inter-electrode distance resulted in decreased shunting of the current through the scalp and the cerebrospinal fluid, and decreasing electrode area resulted in increased current density on the scalp under the edges of the electrode. Our calculations suggest that when working with conventional electrodes (25-35 cm(2)), one of the electrodes should be placed just 'behind' the target relative to the other electrode, for maximum current density on the target. Also electrodes with areas in the range 3.5-12 cm(2) may provide a better compromise between focality and current density in the scalp than the traditional electrodes. Finally, the use of multiple small return electrodes may be more efficient than the use of a single large return electrode.", "pages": "112-20"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Abnormal changes of synaptic excitability in migraine with aura.", "keywords": [], "issue": "10", "pmid": "20445046", "authors": ["Siniatchkin, M", "Sendacki, M", "Moeller, F", "Wolff, S", "Jansen, O", "Siebner, H", "Stephani, U"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation with weak direct currents (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)) has emerged as one of the major tools to induce neuroplastic cortical excitability alterations in humans since its (re-) introduction to the arsenal of plasticity-inducing brain stimulation tools.

The relationship between these abnormalities is still poorly understood. In this study, visual evoked potentials (VEP) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were recorded simultaneously in migraineurs and healthy subjects. In order to investigate the homeostatic-like plasticity in the visual cortex, cortical excitability was modified using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Before any stimulation, migraineurs showed significantly higher glutamate/creatine ratios (Glx/Cr) than healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, excitatory (anodal) tDCS caused an increase and inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS a decrease in the Glx/Cr ratio. Subsequent photic stimulation (PS) reversed the changes in Glx/Cr ratios, which returned back to baseline, demonstrating homeostatic-like metaplasticity in the control group. In migraine patients, both anodal and cathodal tDCS decreased the Glx/Cr ratio, which did not return to baseline after PS. While healthy subjects showed an increase in VEP amplitude under anodal and a reduction under cathodal tDCS, the modifiability of VEP under tDCS was reduced in migraineurs. The results demonstrate a reduced responsiveness of the occipital cortex to interventions that change cortical excitability in migraine. Moreover, altered glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to mediate the relation between abnormal cortical information processing and excitability in migraineurs.", "pages": "112-20"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation coupled with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for the treatment of fibromyalgia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "20547226", "authors": ["Riberto, M", "Marcon Alfieri, F", "Monteiro de Benedetto Pacheco, K", "Dini Leite, V", "Nemoto Kaihami, H", "Fregni, F", "Rizzo Battistella, L"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The open rheumatology journal", "abstract": "Some evidence suggests that the cerebellum participates in the complex network processing emotional facial expression.
