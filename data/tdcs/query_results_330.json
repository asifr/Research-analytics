When an encoded memory is recalled, it becomes labile and another round of consolidation, or reconsolidation, is required to restore its stability. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method of altering cortical excitability. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of tDCS on the reconsolidation of long-term verbal memory. Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a015) memorized words in the encoding session, then reactivated the memory of the words 3\u00a0h later using an old-new recognition task under anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Finally, after another 5\u00a0h, they performed another round of the old-new recognition task and rated their confidence. Anodal tDCS during the second session resulted in significantly more words recognized in the third session as compared to cathodal and sham stimulation. Cathodal tDCS did not affect the recognition performance compared to sham stimulation. These results cannot be attributed to differences in response times and confidence ratings, as they were comparable in all conditions. In order to study whether the activation of a memory was crucial for the enhancing effects of anodal tDCS, a group of controls (n\u00a0=\u00a015) did not perform the recognition task in the second session but still underwent stimulation. Contrary to the main group, anodal stimulation did not enhance the memory performance for the control group. This result suggests that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC can enhance the reconsolidation of long-term memory only when the memory has been reactivated.", "pages": "668-74"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Eyelid myokymia in an older subject after repetitive sessions of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": ["PAS", "neuroplasticity", "nicotine", "non-smokers", "tDCS"], "issue": "3", "pmid": "23137701", "authors": ["Wessel, M", "Zimerman, M", "Timmermann, JE", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "In various studies nicotine has shown to alter cognitive functions in non-smoking subjects. The physiological basis for these effects might be nicotine-generated modulation of cortical structure, excitability, and activity, as mainly described in animal experiments. In accordance, a recently conducted study demonstrated that application of nicotine for hours via nicotine patch in non-smoking humans alters the effects of neuroplasticity-inducing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques on cortical excitability. Specifically, nicotine abolished inhibitory plasticity independent from the focality of the stimulation protocol. While nicotine prevented also the establishment of non-focal facilitatory plasticity, focal synapse-specific facilitatory plasticity was enhanced. These results agree with a focusing effect of prolonged nicotine application on facilitatory plasticity. However, since nicotine induces rapid adaption processes of its receptors, this scenario might differ from the effect of nicotine in cigarette smoking. Thus in this study we aimed to gain further insight in the mechanism of nicotine on plasticity by exploring the effect of nicotine spray on non-focal and focal plasticity-inducing protocols in non-smoking subjects, a fast-acting agent better comparable to cigarette smoking. Focal, synapse-specific plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), while non-focal plasticity was elicited by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Forty eight non-smokers received nicotine spray respectively placebo combined with one of the following protocols (anodal tDCS, cathodal tDCS, PAS-25, and PAS-10). Corticospinal excitability was monitored via motor-evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Nicotine spray abolished facilitatory plasticity irrespective of focality and PAS-10-induced excitability diminution, while tDCS-derived excitability reduction was delayed and weakened. Nicotine spray had thus a clear effect on neuroplasticity in non-smoking subjects. However, the effects of nicotine spray differ clearly from those of prolonged nicotine application, which might be due to missing adaptive nicotinic receptor alterations. These results enhance our knowledge about the dynamic impact of nicotine on plasticity, which might be related to its heterogenous effect on cognition.", "pages": "668-74"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Rapid effect of nicotine intake on neuroplasticity in non-smoking humans.", "keywords": ["PET", "neuroplasticity", "opioid receptors", "post-herpetic neuralgia", "tDCS", "trigeminal neuropathic pain"], "issue": "", "pmid": "23133419", "authors": ["Grundey, J", "Thirugnanasambandam, N", "Kaminsky, K", "Drees, A", "Skwirba, AC", "Lang, N", "Paulus, W", "Nitsche, MA"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "abstract": "Although transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has already been used to manage tinnitus patients, paucity of reports and variations in protocols preclude a comprehensive understanding. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on systemic review to assess effectiveness of tDCS in tinnitus management and to compare stimulation parameters. PubMed was searched for tDCS studies in tinnitus. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 17 studies were identified and 6 of them were included in the systemic review and 2 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Overall 39.5% responded to active tDCS with a mean tinnitus intensity reduction of 13.5%. Additionally, left temporal area (LTA) and bifrontal tDCS indicated comparable results. Active tDCS was found to be more effective than sham tDCS for tinnitus intensity reduction (Hedges' g = .77, 95% confidence interval 0.23-1.31). The efficacy of tDCS in tinnitus could not be fully confirmed by the current study because of the limited number of studies, but all studies included in the current systemic review and meta-analysis demonstrated significant tinnitus intensity improvement. Therefore, tDCS may be a promising tool for tinnitus management. Future RCTs in a large series regarding the efficacy as well as the comparison between LTA- and bifrontal tDCS are recommended.", "pages": "668-74"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation in tinnitus patients: a systemic review and meta-analysis.", "keywords": ["Grating orientation task", "Hypoesthesia", "Randomized controlled clinical trial", "Rehabilitation", "Spatial discrimination"], "issue": "", "pmid": "12205201", "authors": ["Song, JJ", "Vanneste, S", "Van de Heyning, P", "De Ridder, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "TheScientificWorldJournal", "abstract": "We developed a unique protocol where transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the motor cortex is performed during positron emission tomography (PET) scan using a \u03bc-opioid receptor (\u03bcOR) selective radiotracer, [(11)C]carfentanil. This is one of the most important central neuromechanisms associated with pain perception and regulation. We measured \u03bcOR non-displaceable binding potential (\u03bcOR BP(ND)) in a trigeminal neuropathic pain patient (TNP) without creating artifacts, or posing risks to the patient (e.g., monitoring of resistance). The active session directly improved in 36.2% the threshold for experimental cold pain in the trigeminal allodynic area, mandibular branch, but not the TNP patient's clinical pain. Interestingly, the single active tDCS application considerably decreased \u03bcORBP(ND) levels in (sub)cortical pain-matrix structures compared to sham tDCS, especially in the posterior thalamus.
