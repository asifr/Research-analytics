The direct manipulation of cortical brain activity by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could potentially serve as an efficacious complimentary rehabilitatory treatment for speech, language and swallowing disorders of a neurological origin. The high prevalence of positive reports on communication and swallowing outcomes support these premises. Nonetheless, experimental evidence to date in some areas is considered rudimentary and is deficient in providing placebo-controlled substantiation of longitudinal neuroplastic change subsequent to stimulation. The most affirmative therapeutic responses have arisen from small placebo-controlled trials using low-frequency rTMS for patients with non-fluent aphasia and high-frequency rTMS applied to individuals with Parkinson's disease to improve motor speech performance and outcomes. Preliminary studies applying rTMS to ameliorate dysphagic symptoms post-stroke provide positive swallowing outcomes for patients. Further research into the optimization of rTMS protocols, including dosage, stimulation targets for maximal efficacy and placebo techniques, is critically needed to provide a fundamental basis for clinical interventions using this technique. rTMS represents a highly promising and clinically relevant technique, warranting the future development of clinical trials across a spectrum of communication and swallowing pathologies, to substantiate and expand on the methods outlined in published reports.", "pages": "77-91"}, {"volume": "94", "title": "Effects on decreasing upper-limb poststroke muscle tone using transcranial direct current stimulation: a randomized sham-controlled study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "22878231", "authors": ["Wu, D", "Qian, L", "Zorowitz, RD", "Zhang, L", "Qu, Y", "Yuan, Y"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation", "abstract": "To assess the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on decreasing upper-limb (UL) muscle tone after stroke.", "pages": "77-91"}, {"volume": "223", "title": "Neural correlates of the semantic interference effect: new evidence from transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "22863670", "authors": ["Pisoni, A", "Papagno, C", "Cattaneo, Z"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "A prospective, sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial with 4-weeks follow-up.

In particular, prior to the naming task, anodal tDCS was applied over the left superior temporal gyrus (STG, Experiment 1) or the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Experiment 2) to enhance cortical excitability in these regions. In both experiments, participants were tested in two sessions in which either real or sham tDCS was delivered. We found that anodal tDCS over the left STG significantly increased the SI effect, whereas anodal tDCS over the left IFG led to a reduction of the SI effect. Overall, our data confirm the existence of a distributed cortical network involved in lexical retrieval and show that both the left IFG and the left STG play a causal role in this process. In particular, the left IFG is likely to be critical in resolving the conflict between competitor lexical representations, while the left STG seems to be the neural locus of the lexical representational system, where competition among different lexical representations occurs.", "pages": "77-91"}]
