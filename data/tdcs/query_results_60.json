In addition to these localized changes, recent neuroimaging research has attributed an important role to neural networks with a stronger focus on interacting rather than isolated brain regions. The analysis of functional connectivity encompasses task-dependent and -independent synchronous activity in the brain, and thus reflects the organization of the brain in distinct performance-relevant networks. Structural connectivity in white matter pathways, representing the integrity of anatomical connections, underlies the communication between the nodes of these functional networks. Both functional and structural connectivity within these networks have been demonstrated to change with aging, and to have different predictive values for cognitive abilities in older compared to young adults. Structural degeneration has been found in the entire cerebral white matter with greatest deterioration in frontal areas, affecting whole brain structural network efficiency. With regard to functional connectivity, both higher and lower functional coupling has been observed in the aging compared to the young brain. Here, high connectivity within the nodes of specific functional networks on the one hand, and low connectivity to regions outside this network on the other hand, were associated with preserved cognitive functions in aging in most cases. For example, in the language domain, connections between left-hemisphere language-related prefrontal, posterior temporal and parietal areas were described as beneficial, whereas connections between the left and right hemisphere were detrimental for language task performance. Of note, interactions between structural and functional network properties may change in the course of aging and differentially impact behavioral performance in older versus young adults. Finally, studies using noninvasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to simultaneously modulate behavior and functional connectivity support the importance of 'selective connectivity' of aging brain networks for preserved cognitive functions. These studies demonstrate that enhancing task performance by tDCS is paralleled by increased connectivity within functional networks. In this review, we outline the network perspective on healthy brain aging and discuss recent developments in this field. \u00a9 2013 S.

This processing bottleneck is thought to be a key factor in determining our ability to make two decisions simultaneously - i.e., to multitask (Pashler, 1984, 1994; Welford, 1952). Previous functional imaging research (Dux, Ivanoff, Asplund, & Marois, 2006; Dux et\u00a0al., 2009) has localised this bottleneck to the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) of the left hemisphere. Currently, however, it is unknown whether this region is causally involved in multitasking performance. We investigated the role of the left pLPFC in multitasking using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The behavioural paradigm included single- and dual-task trials, each requiring a speeded discrimination of visual stimuli alone, auditory stimuli alone, or both visual and auditory stimuli. Reaction times for single- and dual-task trials were compared before, immediately after, and 20\u00a0min after anodal stimulation (excitatory), cathodal stimulation (inhibitory), or sham stimulation. The cost of responding to the two tasks (i.e., the reduction in performance for dual- vs single-task trials) was significantly reduced by cathodal stimulation, but not by anodal or sham stimulation. Overall, the results provide direct evidence that the left pLPFC is a key neural locus of the central bottleneck that limits an individual's ability to make two simple decisions simultaneously.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation: a role for cortical excitation/inhibition balance?", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24068995", "authors": ["Krause, B", "M\u00e1rquez-Ruiz, J", "Kadosh, RC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "The excitability of the motor areas of the cerebral cortex is reduced in ataxia. Since transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique able to increase the cortical excitability, we assessed the effect of anodal tDCS over the motor cortex in three patients with ataxia. A clinical evaluation, a video-taped SARA rating scale and a gait analysis with cinematic parameters, were performed pre- and post-sham and anodal tDCS cycle. The full cycle was composed by five consecutive constant current sessions of stimulation. Anodal tDCS (2.0\u00a0mA, 20\u00a0min, max current density: 0.0278\u00a0mA/cm(2), max total charge: 0.033\u00a0C/cm(2)) was performed on the M1 area of the most affected side. The contralateral primary motor cortex underwent cathodal stimulation (2.0\u00a0mA, 20\u00a0min, max current density: 0.0278\u00a0mA/cm(2), max total charge: 0.033\u00a0C/cm(2)). After anodal tDCS, gait analysis revealed an improvement of the symmetry of step execution and reduction of base-width lasting 30\u00a0days associated to patients' perception of amelioration. No relevant changes were found after sham stimulation. Our results suggest tDCS can improve gait symmetry in patients with ataxia for a short-term period.
