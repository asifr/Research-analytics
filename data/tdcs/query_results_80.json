This study evaluated the effect of a single session of atDCS on CS excitability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). atDCS and sham tDCS (stDCS) were applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the more severely impaired hand for 20min in a double-blinded crossover design. Changes in CS excitability were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The area under the recruitment curves increased significantly after application of atDCS (+56.58%, p=0.023) but not after stDCS. A sigmoidal curve-analysis revealed a higher plateau of the curve after atDCS (+22.2%, p<0.001). Our results showed that atDCS over M1 has the ability to increase CS output and projection strength in MS-patients, suggesting that atDCS can be considered during neural rehabilitation to facilitate motor recovery in MS.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "554", "title": "Anodal tDCS increases corticospinal output and projection strength in multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": ["CRS-R", "Coma Recovery Scale \u2013 Revised", "EEG", "FDG-PET", "IBP", "MCS", "PVS", "TBI", "UWS", "VS", "[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography", "brain stimulation", "electroencephalography", "fMRI", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "intrathecal baclofen pump", "minimally conscious state", "persistent vegetative state", "tDCS", "transcranial direct current stimulation", "traumatic brain injury", "unresponsive wakefulness syndrome", "vegetative state"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24036466", "authors": ["Cuypers, K", "Leenus, DJ", "Van Wijmeersch, B", "Thijs, H", "Levin, O", "Swinnen, SP", "Meesen, RL"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Humans have long used cognitive enhancement methods to expand the proficiency and range of the various mental activities that they engage in, including writing to store and retrieve information, and computers that allow them to perform myriad activities that are now commonplace in the internet age. Neuroenhancement describes the use of neuroscience-based techniques for enhancing cognitive function by acting directly on the human brain and nervous system, altering its properties to increase performance. Cognitive neuroscience has now reached the point where it may begin to put theory derived from years of experimentation into practice. This special issue includes 16 articles that employ or examine a variety of neuroenhancement methods currently being developed to increase cognition in healthy people and in patients with neurological or psychiatric illness. This includes transcranial electromagnetic stimulation methods, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), along with deep brain stimulation, neurofeedback, behavioral training techniques, and these and other techniques in conjunction with neuroimaging. These methods can be used to improve attention, perception, memory and other forms of cognition in healthy individuals, leading to better performance in many aspects of everyday life. They may also reduce the cost, duration and overall impact of brain and mental illness in patients with neurological and psychiatric illness. Potential disadvantages of these techniques are also discussed. Given that the benefits of neuroenhancement outweigh the potential costs, these methods could potentially reduce suffering and improve quality of life for everyone, while further increasing our knowledge about the mechanisms of human cognition.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Neuroenhancement: Enhancing brain and mind in health and in disease.", "keywords": ["M1 plasticity", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "paired associative stimulation", "repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation", "theta burst stimulation", "transcranial direct current stimulation", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24036352", "authors": ["Clark, VP", "Parasuraman, R"], "year": "2013", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "To assess the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on improving consciousness in patients with persistent unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) (previously termed as persistent vegetative state, PVS) or minimally conscious state (MCS).", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) effects in disorders of consciousness.", "keywords": ["alpha rhythm", "monocephalic montage", "noninvasive electric stimulation", "parietal cortex", "tDCS-EEG"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24035769", "authors": ["Angelakis, E", "Liouta, E", "Andreadis, N", "Korfias, S", "Ktonas, P", "Stranjalis, G", "Sakas, DE"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation", "abstract": "A prospective, case series trial with 12-months follow-up.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "4", "title": "Motor Cortical Plasticity in Parkinson's Disease.", "keywords": ["Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex", "Lucid dreaming", "REM sleep", "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24027555", "authors": ["Udupa, K", "Chen, R"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "abstract": "General and research hospital.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Modulation of spontaneous alpha brain rhythms using low-intensity transcranial direct-current stimulation.", "keywords": ["Stroke", "Transcranial direct current stimulation", "Unilateral visuospatial neglect"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24027517", "authors": ["Spitoni, GF", "Cimmino, RL", "Bozzacchi, C", "Pizzamiglio, L", "Di Russo, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Inpatients with PVS/UWS or MCS (N=10; 7 male, 3 female; age range: 19-62 years; aetiology: traumatic brain injury = 5, anoxia = 4, postoperative infarct = 1; duration of PVS/UWS or MCS range: 6 months - 10 years).
