This phenomenon is known as figural or face after-effect. Although currently the topic of face adaptation enjoys utmost popularity, we still don't know much about the neural process underlying it. The aim of the present study was to determine, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), how the retinotopically organised primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-level, non-retinotopic right lateral temporo-parietal areas interact with facial adaptation processing. Seventeen healthy subjects received 10 min anodal, cathodal or sham stimulation over these areas during a facial adaptation task. Cathodal stimulation of the right temporo-parietal cortex reduces the magnitude of facial adaptation while stimulation over the V1 results in no significant effects. These data imply that mainly lateral temporo-parietal cortical areas play role in facial adaptation and in facial gender discrimination, supporting the idea that the observed after-effects are the result of high-level, configurational adaptation mechanisms.", "pages": "805-11"}, {"volume": "79", "title": "Improved naming after transcranial direct current stimulation in aphasia.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "10527368", "authors": ["Monti, A", "Cogiamanian, F", "Marceglia, S", "Ferrucci, R", "Mameli, F", "Mrakic-Sposta, S", "Vergari, M", "Zago, S", "Priori, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently undergone a resurgence in popularity as a powerful tool to non-invasively manipulate brain activity. While tDCS has been used to alter functions tied to primary motor and visual cortices, its impact on extrastriate visual areas involved in visuo-spatial processing has not yet been examined. In the current study, we applied tDCS to the cat visuoparietal (VP) cortex and assayed performance in a paradigm designed to assess the capacity to detect, localize and orient to static targets appearing at different spatial eccentricities within the visual field. Real or sham cathodal tDCS was unilaterally applied to the VP cortex, and orienting performance was assessed during (online), immediately after (offline; Experiments 1 and 2), and 1 or 24 h after the end of the tDCS stimulation (Experiment 2). Performance was compared to baseline data collected immediately prior to stimulation. Real, but not sham, tDCS induced significant decreases in performance for static visual targets presented in the contrastimulated visual hemifield. The behavioral impact of tDCS was most apparent during the online and immediate offline periods. The tDCS effect decayed progressively over time and performance returned to baseline levels approximately 60 min after stimulation. These results are consistent with the effects of both invasive and non-invasive deactivation methods applied to the same brain region, and indicate that tDCS has the potential to modify neuronal activity in extrastriate visual regions and to sculpt brain activity and behavior in normal and neurologically impaired subjects.", "pages": "805-11"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "Bidirectional modulation of primary visual cortex excitability: a combined tDCS and rTMS study.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "16045502", "authors": ["Lang, N", "Siebner, HR", "Chadaide, Z", "Boros, K", "Nitsche, MA", "Rothwell, JC", "Paulus, W", "Antal, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "abstract": "Multiple cortical areas including the primary somatosensory cortex are known to be involved in nociception.
