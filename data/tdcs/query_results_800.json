Despite the social implications of utilitarian behavior, its neurophysiological bases remain largely unknown. To assess how the human brain controls utilitarian behavior, we delivered transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPC) and over the occipital cortex (OC) in 78 healthy subjects. Utilitarian judgment was assessed with the moral judgment task before and after tDCS. At baseline, females provided fewer utilitarian answers than males for personal moral dilemmas (p = .007). In males, VPC-tDCS failed to induce changes and in both genders OC-tDCS left utilitarian judgments unchanged. In females, cathodal VPC-tDCS tended to decrease whereas anodal VPC-tDCS significantly increased utilitarian responses (p = .005). In males and females, reaction times for utilitarian responses significantly decreased after cathodal (p<.001) but not after anodal (p = .735) VPC-tDCS. We conclude that ventral prefrontal tDCS interferes with utilitarian decisions, influencing the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each option in both sexes, but does so more strongly in females. Whereas cathodal tDCS alters the time for utilitarian reasoning in both sexes, anodal stimulation interferes more incisively in women, modifying utilitarian reasoning and the possible consequent actions. The gender-related tDCS-induced changes suggest that the VPC differentially controls utilitarian reasoning in females and in males. The gender-specific functional organization of the brain areas involved in utilitarian behavior could be a correlate of the moral and social behavioral differences between the two sexes.", "pages": "e8865"}, {"volume": "90", "title": "Interhemispheric modulation induced by cortical stimulation and motor training.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "10989620", "authors": ["Williams, JA", "Pascual-Leone, A", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Physical therapy", "abstract": "Interhemispheric inhibition might be a beneficial cortico-cortical interaction, but also might be maladaptive in people with neurological disorders.

Currently, the duration of the aftereffects of stimulation is restricted. For future clinical applications, stimulation protocols are required that produce aftereffects lasting for days or weeks. Options to prolong the effects of tDCS are further prolongation or repetition of tDCS. Nothing is known thus far about optimal protocols in this behalf, although repetitive stimulation is already performed in clinical applications. Thus we explored the effects of different break durations on cathodal tDCS-induced cortical excitability alterations. In 12 subjects, two identical periods of cathodal tDCS (9-min duration; 1 mA) with an interstimulation interval of 0 (no break), 3, or 20 min or 3 or 24 h were performed. The results indicate that doubling stimulation duration without a break prolongs the aftereffects from 60 to 90 min after tDCS. When the second stimulation was performed during the aftereffects of the first, a prolongation and enhancement of tDCS-induced effects for \u2264 120 min after stimulation was observed. In contrast, when the second stimulation followed the first one after 3 or 24 h, the aftereffects were initially attenuated, or abolished, but afterwards re-established for up to 120 min after tDCS in the 24-h condition. These results suggest that, for prolonging the aftereffects of cathodal tDCS, stimulation interval might be important.", "pages": "e8865"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation provides means to assess cortical plasticity and excitability in humans with fragile x syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "15162935", "authors": ["Oberman, L", "Ifert-Miller, F", "Najib, U", "Bashir, S", "Woollacott, I", "Gonzalez-Heydrich, J", "Picker, J", "Rotenberg, A", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Frontiers in synaptic neuroscience", "abstract": "Cognitive performance usually declines in older adults as a result of neurodegenerative processes. One of the cognitive domains usually affected is decision-making. Based on our recent findings suggesting that non-invasive brain stimulation can improve decision-making in young participants, we studied whether bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right and left prefrontal cortex of older adult subjects can change balance of risky and safe responses as it can in younger individuals. Twenty-eight subjects (age range from 50 to 85 years) performed a gambling risk task while receiving either anodal tDCS over the right and cathodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anodal tDCS over the left with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC, or sham stimulation. Our main finding was a significant group effect showing that participants receiving left anodal/right cathodal stimulation chose more often high-risk prospects as compared with participants receiving sham or those receiving right anodal/left cathodal stimulation. This result is contrary to previous findings in young subjects, suggesting that modulation of cortical activity in young and elderly results in opposite behavioral effects; thus supporting fundamental changes in cognitive processing in the elderly.", "pages": "e8865"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Noninvasive brain stimulation with low-intensity electrical currents: putative mechanisms of action for direct and alternating current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15351632", "authors": ["Zaghi, S", "Acar, M", "Hultgren, B", "Boggio, PS", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique for brain stimulation and it increasingly being used in the treatments of some neurological/psychiatric conditions (e.g. chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, motor rehabilitation after stroke and Parkinson's disease). With tDCS, cortical neurons excitability increases in the vicinity of the anodal electrode and suppressed near the cathodal electrode. There is evidence that anorexia is associated with hyperactivity in right-hemisphere frontal regions. tDCS, therefore has a promising potential in facilitating inter-hemispheric balance. A tDCS protocol is proposed: the anode electrode placed over the left prefrontal cortex and the cathode electrode located, either on the right homotopic region for non-SSRI-medicated anorexics, or on a non-cephalic site for SSRI-medicated anorexics. Together with nutritional supplements, psychotherapy and other treatments, tDCS have a good potential, as a complementary tool, in the treatment of anorexia.", "pages": "e8865"}]
