Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was administered to the left prefrontal and to the primary visual cortex of 22 healthy subjects while they performed a PCL task. In this task subjects learned which of two outcomes would occur on each trial after presentation of a particular combination of cues. Ten minutes of anodal, but not cathodal, stimulation improved implicit learning only when the left PFC was stimulated. Our results show that implicit PLC can be modified by weak anodal tDCS, which probably increases neural excitability, as has been shown in the motor and visual cortices previously.

In this study we tested the involvement of V1 in the perception of moving phosphenes by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to this area. tDCS is a non-invasive stimulation technique known to modulate cortical excitability in a polarity-specific manner. Moving and stationary phosphene thresholds (PT) were measured by TMS before, immediately after and 10, 20 and 30 min after the end of 10 min cathodal and anodal tDCS in nine healthy subjects.

In a first attempt, we performed extracellular single-unit recordings in the primary visual cortex (area 17) of the anaesthetised and paralysed cat, with the stimulating magnetic field centred at the recording site (2 x 70 mm figure-of-eight coil). The effect of single biphasic TMS pulses, which induce a lateral-to-medial electric current within the occipital pole of the right hemisphere, was tested for spontaneous as well as visually evoked activity. For cat visual cortex we found that a single TMS pulse elicited distinct episodes of enhanced and suppressed activity: in general, a facilitation of activity was found during the first 500 ms, followed thereafter by a suppression of activity lasting up to a few seconds. Strong stimuli exceeding 50 % of maximal stimulator output could also lead to an early suppression of activity during the first 100-200 ms, followed by stronger (rebound) facilitation. Early suppression and facilitation of activity may be related to a more or less direct stimulation of inhibitory and excitatory interneurons, probably with different thresholds. The late, long-lasting suppression is more likely to be related to metabotropic or metabolic processes, or even vascular responses. The time course of facilitation/inhibition may provide clues regarding the action of repetitive TMS application.", "pages": "113-7"}, {"volume": "553", "title": "Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on single-unit activity in the cat primary visual cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "12963791", "authors": ["Moliadze, V", "Zhao, Y", "Eysel, U", "Funke, K"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex results in polarity-specific shifts of cortical excitability during and after stimulation. Anodal tDCS enhances and cathodal stimulation reduces excitability. Animal experiments have demonstrated that the effect of anodal tDCS is caused by neuronal depolarisation, while cathodal tDCS hyperpolarises cortical neurones. However, not much is known about the ion channels and receptors involved in these effects. Thus, the impact of the sodium channel blocker carbamazepine, the calcium channel blocker flunarizine and the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane on tDCS-elicited motor cortical excitability changes of healthy human subjects were tested. tDCS-protocols inducing excitability alterations (1) only during tDCS and (2) eliciting long-lasting after-effects were applied after drug administration. Carbamazepine selectively eliminated the excitability enhancement induced by anodal stimulation during and after tDCS. Flunarizine resulted in similar changes. Antagonising NMDA receptors did not alter current-generated excitability changes during a short stimulation, which elicits no after-effects, but prevented the induction of long-lasting after-effects independent of their direction. These results suggest that, like in other animals, cortical excitability shifts induced during tDCS in humans also depend on membrane polarisation, thus modulating the conductance of sodium and calcium channels. Moreover, they suggest that the after-effects may be NMDA receptor dependent. Since NMDA receptors are involved in neuroplastic changes, the results suggest a possible application of tDCS in the modulation or induction of these processes in a clinical setting. The selective elimination of tDCS-driven excitability enhancements by carbamazepine proposes a role for this drug in focussing the effects of cathodal tDCS, which may have important future clinical applications.", "pages": "113-7"}, {"volume": "553", "title": "Pharmacological modulation of cortical excitability shifts induced by transcranial direct current stimulation in humans.", "keywords": [], "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "9437031", "authors": ["Nitsche, MA", "Fricke, K", "Henschke, U", "Schlitterlau, A", "Liebetanz, D", "Lang, N", "Henning, S", "Tergau, F", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of short periods of simultaneous weak anodal direct current (DC) stimulation and peripheral ulnar nerve (ES) stimulation on corticospinal excitability.

Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI); Abductor Digiti Minimi (ADM) and Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (FCU). The baseline MEP amplitude was compared with that obtained immediately after the first set of stimulation, after the second set of stimulation, 15 min post stimulation and 30 min after stimulation. No significant change was seen with the No Stimulation and ES Only protocols. FDI showed a significant change in the DC protocol after the second set of stimulation but the changes were not present 15 or 30 min after. The DC plus ES protocol showed FDI changes that were significant after the second set of stimulation with the elevations persisting when tested 15 and 30 min post intervention.

Compound motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) may provide valuable information about corticospinal transmission, especially in patients with neurological disorders, but generally do not allow conclusions regarding the details of corticospinal function to be made. Techniques such as poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the discharge of single, voluntarily activated motor units and conditioning of H reflexes provide a more optimal way of evaluating transmission in specific excitatory and inhibitory pathways. Through application of such techniques, several important issues have been clarified. TMS has provided the first real evidence that direct monosynaptic connections from the motor cortex to spinal motoneurons exist in man, and it has been revealed that the distribution of these projections roughly follows the same proximal-distal gradient as in other primates. However, pronounced differences also exist. In particular, the tibialis anterior muscle appears to receive as significant a monosynaptic corticospinal drive as muscles in the hand. The reason for this may be the importance of this muscle in controlling the foot trajectory in the swing phase of walking. Conditioning of H reflexes by TMS has provided evidence of changes in cortical excitability prior to and during various movements. These experiments have generally confirmed information obtained from chronic recording of the activity of corticospinal cells in primates, but information about the corticospinal contribution to movements for which information from other primates is sparse or lacking has also been obtained. One example is walking, where TMS experiments have revealed that the corticospinal tract makes an important contribution to the ongoing EMG activity during treadmill walking. TMS experiments have also documented the convergence of descending corticospinal projections and peripheral afferents on spinal interneurons. Current investigations of the functional significance of this convergence also rely on TMS experiments. The general conclusion from this review is that TMS is a powerful technique in the analysis of motor control, but that care is necessary when interpreting the data. Combining TMS with other techniques such as PSTH and H reflex testing amplifies greatly the power of the technique.", "pages": "113-7"}, {"volume": "152", "title": "Investigating human motor control by transcranial magnetic stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "9547074", "authors": ["Petersen, NT", "Pyndt, HS", "Nielsen, JB"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
