The key role of prefrontal dopamine function for executive functions suggest that differences of the Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene would interact with tDCS interventions in this domain.

With greater time-on-task the ability to detect targets decreases and reaction time increases-a phenomenon termed the vigilance decrement. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the vigilance decrement. Subjects (n=19) received prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at one of two different time points during a vigilance task (early or late). The impact of tDCS was examined using measures of behavior, hemispheric blood flow velocity, and regional blood oxygenation relative to sham stimulation. In the sham condition greater time-on-task was accompanied by fewer target detections and slower reaction times, indicating a vigilance decrement, and decreased blood flow velocity. tDCS significantly altered baseline task-induced physiologic and behavioral changes, dependent on the time of stimulation administration and electrode configuration (determining polarity of stimulation). Compared to the sham condition, with more time-on-task blood flow velocity decreased less and cerebral oxygenation increased more in the tDCS condition. Behavioral measures showed a significant improvement in target detection performance with tDCS compared to the sham stimulation. Signal detection analysis revealed a significant change in operator discriminability and response bias with increased time-on-task, as well as interactions between time of stimulation administration and electrode configuration. Current density modeling of tDCS showed high densities in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings confirm that cerebral hemodynamic measures provide an index of resource utilization and point to the central role of the frontal cortex in vigilance. Further, they suggest that modulation of the frontal cortices-and connected structures-influences the availability of vigilance resources. These findings indicate that tDCS may be well-suited to mitigate performance degradation in work settings requiring sustained attention or as a possible treatment for neurological or psychiatric disorders involving sustained attention.", "pages": "1801-7"}, {"volume": "73", "title": "Neuroenhancement of the aging brain: restoring skill acquisition in old subjects.", "keywords": [], "issue": "1", "pmid": "23225625", "authors": ["Zimerman, M", "Nitsch, M", "Giraux, P", "Gerloff, C", "Cohen, LG", "Hummel, FC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been widely used, with some modification of its methods, for the treatment of refractory mental disorders.

Mechanisms of ECT are still unknown, but the neurogenesis hypothesis is promising.

One property still debated and contested is the puzzling absence of phenomenal visual percepts of visual stimuli that can be detected with perfect accuracy.

High contrast and low contrast stimuli were presented as a moving grating in his blind hemifield. When left area MT/V5 was anodally stimulated during the presentation of high-contrast gratings, he never reported a phenomenal percept of a moving grating but showed perfect blindsight performance. When applied along with low contrast gratings, for which accuracy was titrated to 60-70\u00a0%, performance did not improve but responses were significantly faster. Cathodal stimulation had no effect. Results are explained in the framework of GY's reorganized cortical connexions and oscillatory patterns known to be involved in awareness in GY.
