Previously, anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) has been shown to improve motor performance in healthy subjects and neurodegenerative populations. However, the effect of atDCS on motor performance is not examined in MS. Methods: In the current study, a sham controlled double-blind crossover design was used to evaluate the effect of 20 minutes of 1 mA atDCS or sham tDCS (stDCS) on a unimanual motor sequence-training task, consisting of sequential finger presses on a computer keyboard with the most impaired hand. Patients received stimulation (atDCS or stDCS) during motor training. tDCS was applied over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the most impaired hand. Motor performance was assessed immediately before, during and 30 minutes after stimulation. Results: Although we need to be careful with the interpretation of the data due to lack of power, our results showed no significant effect of atDCS on motor performance. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that atDCS-supported motor training was not able to improve motor performance more than sham-supported motor training. Possibly, the effects of atDCS are mediated by specific MS-related characteristics. Furthermore, increasing atDCS intensity and offering multiple stimulation sessions might be necessary to optimize motor performance resulting from atDCS-supported motor training.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "A single session of 1 mA anodal tDCS-supported motor training does not improve motor performance in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "keywords": ["animal models", "electroencephalogram (EEG)", "entrainment", "gamma", "oscillations", "slow wave", "transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)", "transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24169364", "authors": ["Meesen, RL", "Thijs, H", "Leenus, DJ", "Cuypers, K"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Rhythmic neuronal activity is ubiquitous in the human brain. These rhythms originate from a variety of different network mechanisms, which give rise to a wide-ranging spectrum of oscillation frequencies. In the last few years an increasing number of clinical research studies have explored transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with weak current as a tool for affecting brain function. The premise of these interventions is that tACS will interact with ongoing brain oscillations. However, the exact mechanisms by which weak currents could affect neuronal oscillations at different frequency bands are not well known and this, in turn, limits the rational optimization of human experiments. Here we review the available in vitro and in vivo animal studies that attempt to provide mechanistic explanations. The findings can be summarized into a few generic principles, such as periodic modulation of excitability, shifts in spike timing, modulation of firing rate, and shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. These effects result from weak but simultaneous polarization of a large number of neurons. Whether this can lead to an entrainment or a modulation of brain oscillations, or whether AC currents have no effect at all, depends entirely on the specific dynamic that gives rise to the different brain rhythms, as discussed here for slow wave oscillations (\u223c1 Hz) and gamma oscillations (\u223c30 Hz). We conclude with suggestions for further experiments to investigate the role of AC stimulation for other physiologically relevant brain rhythms.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Effects of weak transcranial alternating current stimulation on brain activity-a review of known mechanisms from animal studies.", "keywords": ["Body mass index", "Finite-element modeling", "Head fat", "Obesity", "tDCS"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24167483", "authors": ["Reato, D", "Rahman, A", "Bikson, M", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "abstract": "Background and purpose: Recent research suggests that an increased level of stroke-affected left hemisphere cortical (especially frontal) excitability is associated with better language improvement in aphasic patients. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS), increasing cortical activity, may facilitate perilesional left hemisphere recruitment to subserve language processing and enhance effects of behavioural therapy. The aim of the study (randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled) was to evaluate the effectiveness of repeated A-tDCS over Broca area as a strategy to enhance aphasia recovery during early post-stroke rehabilitation. Material and methods: Thirty-seven participants with moderate or severe aphasia were randomized to receive 15 consecutive daily sessions of A-tDCS (1 mA, 10 min; experimental group, n = 18) or sham stimulation (1 mA, 25 s; control group, n = 19) followed by language therapy. Effects of tDCS were assessed using the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, performed before and after the rehabilitation, and three months later. Results: The results did not confirm a positive impact of repeated A-tDCS, preceding language therapy, on language abilities in our patients. Although both groups improved after the therapy, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in either short-term or long-term tDCS effects. Effect sizes for the experimental group, at post-treatment and the 3-month follow-up, were slightly higher than in controls but insufficient to infer any beneficial influence of the applied intervention. Conclusions: The findings do not support A-tDCS functional benefits during early rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasia. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of this kind of neuromodulation.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "47", "title": "No effects of anodal transcranial direct stimulation on language abilities in early rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasic patients.", "keywords": ["anatomical brain connectivity", "neuromodulation", "stimulation protocol", "transcranial direct current stimulation", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "issue": "5", "pmid": "24166562", "authors": ["Polanowska, KE", "Le\u015bniak, M", "Seni\u00f3w, JB", "Cz\u0142onkowska, A"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska", "abstract": "The threshold and direction of excitability changes induced by low- and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the primary motor cortex can be effectively reverted by a preceding session of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a phenomenon referred to as \"metaplasticity\". Here, we used a combined tDCS-rTMS protocol and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in healthy subjects to provide direct electrophysiological evidence for metaplasticity in the human visual cortex. Specifically, we evaluated changes in VEPs at two different contrasts (90 and 20\u00a0%) before and at different time points after the application of anodal or cathodal tDCS to occipital cortex (i.e., priming), followed by an additional conditioning with low- or high-frequency rTMS. Anodal tDCS increased the amplitude of VEPs and this effect was paradoxically reverted by applying high-frequency (5\u00a0Hz), conventionally excitatory rTMS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Similarly, cathodal tDCS led to a decrease in VEPs amplitude, which was reverted by a subsequent application of conventionally inhibitory, 1\u00a0Hz rTMS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Similar changes were observed for both the N1 and P1 component of the VEP. There were no significant changes in resting motor threshold values (p\u00a0>\u00a00.5), confirming the spatial selectivity of our conditioning protocol. Our findings show that preconditioning primary visual area excitability with tDCS can modulate the direction and strength of plasticity induced by subsequent application of 1 or 5\u00a0Hz rTMS. These data indicate the presence of mechanisms of metaplasticity that keep synaptic strengths within a functional dynamic range in the human visual cortex.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in a Patient With Schizoaffective Disorder Manic Episode.", "keywords": ["anorexia nervosa (AN)", "bulimia nervosa (BN)", "deep brain stimulation (DBS)", "eating disorders (ED)", "transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)", "transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)", "vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)"], "issue": "", "pmid": "24165097", "authors": ["H\u0131zl\u0131 Sayar, G", "Salcini, C", "Ozten, E", "G\u00fcl, IG", "Ery\u0131lmaz, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society", "abstract": "Recent studies show that acute neuromodulation of the prefrontal cortex with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can decrease food craving, attentional bias to food, and actual food intake. These data suggest potential clinical applications for tDCS in the field of obesity. However, optimal stimulation parameters in obese individuals are uncertain. One fundamental concern is whether a thick, low-conductivity layer of subcutaneous fat around the head can affect current density distribution and require dose adjustments during tDCS administration. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of head fat on the distribution of current during tDCS and evaluate whether dosing standards for tDCS developed for adult individuals in general are adequate for the obese population. We used MRI-derived high-resolution computational models that delineated fat layers in five human heads from subjects with body mass index (BMI) ranging from \"normal-lean\" to \"super-obese\" (20.9 to 53.5\u00a0kg/m(2)). Data derived from these simulations suggest that head fat influences tDCS current density across the brain, but its relative contribution is small when other components of head anatomy are added. Current density variability between subjects does not appear to have a direct and/or simple link to BMI. These results indicate that guidelines for the use of tDCS can be extrapolated to obese subjects without sacrificing efficacy and/or treatment safety; the recommended standard parameters can lead to the delivery of adequate current flow to induce neuromodulation of brain activity in the obese population.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Evidence for metaplasticity in the human visual cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "", "pmid": "24162796", "authors": ["Bocci, T", "Caleo, M", "Tognazzi, S", "Francini, N", "Briscese, L", "Maffei, L", "Rossi, S", "Priori, A", "Sartucci, F"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is investigated for a broad range of neuropsychiatric indications, various rehabilitation applications, and to modulate cognitive performance in diverse tasks.

Practically, specificity of tDCS implies application-specific customization of protocols to maximize desired outcomes and minimize undesired effects. Especially given the simplicity of tDCS and the complexity of brain function, understanding the mechanisms leading to specificity is fundamental to the rational advancement of tDCS. We define the origins of specificity based on anatomical and functional factors. Anatomical specificity derives from guiding current to targeted brain structures. Functional specificity may derive from either activity-selectivity, where active neuronal networks are preferentially modulated by tDCS, or input-selectivity, where bias is applied to different synaptic inputs.
