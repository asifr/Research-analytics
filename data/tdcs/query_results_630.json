In the chronic stage, brain stimulation coupled to rehabilitation may enhance behavioral recovery, learning of new skills, and cortical plasticity. Correlative animal models and comprehensive safety trials seem critical to establish the use of these modalities in TBI.", "pages": "274-92"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Distractibility during episodic retrieval is exacerbated by perturbation of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "3", "pmid": "15668572", "authors": ["Wais, PE", "Kim, OY", "Gazzaley, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "Different forms of NBS techniques harbor the promise of diagnostic and therapeutic utility, particularly to guide processes of cortical reorganization and enable functional restoration in TBI.

Here, we aimed to test if object-location learning and its retention could be modified by noninvasive brain stimulation. In a group of 20 elderly (mean age 62.1 years) right-handed individuals, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; 20 minutes, 1 mA) over the right temporoparietal cortex, while subjects acquired the correct position of buildings on a street map using an associative learning paradigm. Each subject participated in a randomized and balanced order in 1 session of anodal tDCS and 1 session of sham stimulation, in a double-blind design with 2 parallel versions of the task. Outcome measures were learning success at the end of each session, and immediate as well as delayed (1 week) free recall. We found that subjects performed comparably in the learning task in the 2 conditions, but showed improved recall 1 week after learning with anodal tDCS compared with learning with sham stimulation. In conclusion, retention of object-location learning in the elderly may be modulated by noninvasive brain stimulation, a finding of potential relevance not only for normal aging but also for memory deficits in pathological aging.", "pages": "274-92"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Improving working memory: exploring the effect of transcranial random noise stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.", "keywords": [], "issue": "12", "pmid": "15709533", "authors": ["Mulquiney, PG", "Hoy, KE", "Daskalakis, ZJ", "Fitzgerald, PB"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been found to produce significant changes in behavior, including a large increase of learning and performance for a difficult visual perceptual task (Clark et al., NeuroImage 2010). The mechanisms by which tDCS produces these behavioral effects are currently uncertain. One hypothesis is that anodal tDCS leads to increased metabolic activity in the brain, which enhances cognitive and memory processes. Here we examined the neuronal mechanisms by which tDCS influences learning by measuring changes in brain metabolite concentrations using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (\u00b9H MRS). As perception and learning can also influence neurochemistry, here we applied tDCS during rest. MRS data was obtained before and after 2.0 mA of anodal tDCS was applied for 30 min over electrode site P4, with the cathode placed on the contralateral arm. MRS data were acquired from the right parietal lobe beneath the anodal tDCS electrode, and from the homologous regions of the left hemisphere once before and once after tDCS. Significantly higher combined glutamate and glutamine levels were found in right parietal cortex, beneath the stimulating electrode, with non-significant increases in homologous regions of the opposite hemisphere. In addition, a significant interaction between hemispheres was found for tDCS effects on tNAA. These results suggest that changes in glutamatergic activity and tNAA may be related to the mechanisms by which tDCS influences learning and behavior.", "pages": "274-92"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Optimized multi-electrode stimulation increases focality and intensity at target.", "keywords": [], "issue": "4", "pmid": "15753425", "authors": ["Dmochowski, JP", "Datta, A", "Bikson, M", "Su, Y", "Parra, LC"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "The presence of irrelevant external stimuli during the retrieval of long-term memory (LTM) has a negative impact on the fidelity of recollected details. Top-down control processes that both guide the selection of internal information relevant to LTM goals and resolve interference on retrieval from irrelevant external information have been associated with the same region in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). The current study examined a causal role of the left VLPFC in memory performance when external distraction (i.e., visual stimuli irrelevant to the current task goals) was presented during retrieval of LTM. Immediately after functional perturbation of the left VLPFC with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, participants' memory was tested when their eyes were closed and when their eyes were open and irrelevant visual stimuli were presented. The results showed that visual distraction diminished LTM performance based on an objective measure of recollection and that perturbation of left VLPFC exacerbated the disruptive effect. This is the first evidence of a direct role of the left VLPFC in diminishing the impact of distraction on recollection, elucidating neural mechanisms that are critically involved in how we reconstruct the past while navigating the external environment.", "pages": "274-92"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Electrode positioning and montage in transcranial direct current stimulation.", "keywords": [], "issue": "51", "pmid": "16775134", "authors": ["DaSilva, AF", "Volz, MS", "Bikson, M", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease caused by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons.
