This obstacle has major scientific and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation (DBS); moreover, many debilitating side effects of DBS likely result from lack of cell-type specificity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address specific cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of CNS neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because ChR2 is genetically targetable, specific populations of neurons even sparsely embedded within intact circuitry can be stimulated with high temporal precision. Here we report the first in vivo behavioral demonstration of a functional optical neural interface (ONI) in intact animals, involving integrated fiberoptic and optogenetic technology. We developed a solid-state laser diode system that can be pulsed with millisecond precision, outputs 20 mW of power at 473 nm, and is coupled to a lightweight, flexible multimode optical fiber, approximately 200 microm in diameter. To capitalize on the unique advantages of this system, we specifically targeted ChR2 to excitatory cells in vivo with the CaMKIIalpha promoter. Under these conditions, the intensity of light exiting the fiber ( approximately 380 mW mm(-2)) was sufficient to drive excitatory neurons in vivo and control motor cortex function with behavioral output in intact rodents. No exogenous chemical cofactor was needed at any point, a crucial finding for in vivo work in large mammals. Achieving modulation of behavior with optical control of neuronal subtypes may give rise to fundamental network-level insights complementary to what electrode methodologies have taught us, and the emerging optogenetic toolkit may find application across a broad range of neuroscience, neuroengineering and clinical questions.", "pages": "1152-3"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus neuronal activity in Parkinson's disease and epilepsy subjects.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16055761", "authors": ["Montgomery, EB"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "Activity from 113 subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons from two epilepsy patients and 103 neurons from 9 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing DBS surgery showed no significant differences in frequencies (PD, mean 7.5+/-7.0 spikes/s (sps), epilepsy mean 7.8+/-8.5 sps) or in the coefficients of variation of mean discharge frequencies per 1s epochs.

In this study the effect of changes in some LFS (1Hz, monophasic square wave) parameters (intensity, pulse duration and train duration) on piriform cortex kindled seizures was investigated both in fully kindled rats and during kindling acquisition. In fully kindled animals, application of different patterns of LFS immediately before kindling stimulation had no significant effect on seizure parameters. However, daily (15 min) application of LFS (0.1 ms pulse duration at intensity equal to after-discharge threshold (ADT) and 1 ms pulse duration at intensity equal to 1/4 ADT) during inter-seizure interval of 7 days significantly reduced the stage 5 duration of the next kindled seizure. Application of the same two LFS protocols for 3 days and 2 weeks had no effect on seizure parameters. The effect of LFS was also tested using different paradigms during kindling acquisition. When LFS (0.1 and 1 ms pulse duration, intensity equal to ADT and 1/4 ADT) was delivered daily after each kindling stimulation, it could significantly decrease after-discharge duration in various days during kindling development. In this experiment, only LFS with 0.1 ms pulse duration and intensity equal to ADT significantly delayed the appearance of seizure stages 1 and 2. According to obtained results, it may be concluded that in fully kindled rats application of different patterns of LFS before kindling stimulation has no anticonvulsant effect, but it can exert an inhibitory effect when applied during an inter-seizure interval of 7 days. In addition, LFS has antiepileptogenic effect during kindling acquisition.

Just as deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the practice of movement disorder surgery, its application to psychiatric illness has become the cutting edge of functional and restorative neurosurgery.

DBS targeting this circuitry appears from initial evidence in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to be a promising option for patients with neuropsychiatric illness resistant to conventional therapies. Further exploring the anatomic interconnectivity of the physiologically relevant cortical and subcortical areas will inevitably lead to better applications of DBS for the treatment of OCD, major depression (MD) and potentially for other psychiatric disorders.

By modeling both excitatory and inhibitory actions of the electrical stimulation, we revealed the desynchronization impacts of the novel stimulation techniques. This contrasts with standard high-frequency stimulation, which failed to desynchronize the target population and whose inhibitory effects blocked all neuronal activity.

To compensate for the lack of studies on the effects of this generic depth EBI on therapeutic DBS, we constructed a three-dimensional computational model of the EBI using the finite element method, in which the structural details and biophysical properties of the EBI are preserved. Our investigations focus on the peri-electrode space as a significant element of the EBI, and its physiological and pathological modulation, in particular by brain pulsation and giant cell formation. We also consider the difference between the current fields induced by different configurations of the quadripolar electrode contacts. These results quantitatively demonstrated that the peri-electrode space is a significant element of the EBI and its biophysical properties are modulated by brain pulsation and giant cell formation, as well as by the choice of electrode contact configuration.

Although it is difficult to identify laminar borders in the primary auditory cortex (AI) laminar differences in functional processing are still present. We have used electrodes inserted orthogonal to the cortical surface to compare the response properties of cells in all six layers of AI in anaesthetised guinea pigs. Cells were stimulated with short tone pips and two conspecific vocalizations. When frequency response areas were measured for 248 units the tuning bandwidth was broader for units in the deep layers. The mean Q (10) value for tuning in layers IV-VI was significantly smaller (Mann-Whitney test P < 0.001) than for layers I-III. When response latencies were measured, the shortest latencies were found in layer V and the mean latency in this layer was shorter than in any of the more superficial layers (I-IV) when compared with a Tukey analysis of variance (P < 0.005). There were also laminar differences in the best threshold with layer V having the highest mean value. The mean best threshold for layer V (32.7 dB SPL) was significantly different from the means for layers II (25.5 dB SPL) and III (26.3 dB SPL). The responses to two vocalizations also varied between layers: the response to the first phrase of a chutter was smaller and about 10 ms later in the deep layers than in layers II and III. By contrast, the response to an example of whistle was stronger in the deep layers. These results are consistent with a model of AI that involves separate inputs to different layers and descending outputs from layers V/VI (to thalamus and brainstem) that are different from the output from layers II/III (to ipsilateral cortex).", "pages": "1152-3"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "Inpatient rehabilitation after deep brain stimulator placement: a case series.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "14963749", "authors": ["Nampiaparampil, DE", "Kuppy, JE", "Nampiaparampil, GM", "Salles, SS"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "Dopaminergic drugs and deep brain stimulation restore cortical inhibition in Parkinson disease (PD) patients. High-frequency rTMS was also found to increase cortical inhibition in PD but its therapeutic effect is still controversial.

The present study aims to explore the lasting effects of sub-threshold hf rTMS trains over M1 on cortical inhibition in patients with \"on\" and without \"off\" L-DOPA treatment. Fourteen PD patients were examined twice while \"on\" and \"off\" medication. In both conditions, a paired-pulse paradigm was used to evaluate short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and long intracortical inhibition (LICI) that were evaluated before and after hf rTMS trains applied on the motor cortex. The results were compared with those obtained from normal controls. In baseline condition, SICI and LICI were significantly reduced in \"off\" compared to \"on\" patients and controls. hf-rTMS over the motor cortex significantly increased SICI and LICI in \"off\" medication PD patients. Magnetic stimulation proved to be ineffective when the same patients were in \"on\" state. The results showed that hf-rTMS affected intracortical inhibition (ICI) only in unmedicated patients. By restoring cortical inhibitory circuits dopaminergic drugs, normalize the excitability changes in M1 subsequent to motor rTMS. Whether patients are in a medicated or an unmedicated state would therefore appear to be critical for rTMS effects in PD patients.

However, backpropagating action potentials (BPAPs) have been studied mainly in slices, in which they are highly sensitive to multiple factors such as firing frequency and membrane conductance, raising doubts about their effectiveness in the awake behaving brain. Here, we examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of BPAPs in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of adult, awake rabbits, in which EEG-defined brain states ranged from alert vigilance to drowsy/inattention, and, in some cases, to light sleep. To achieve this, we recorded extracellular spikes from layer 5 pyramidal neurons and field potentials above and below these neurons using a 16-channel linear probe, and applied methods of spike-triggered current source-density analysis to these records (Buzs\u00e1ki and Kandel, 1998; Swadlow et al., 2002). Precise retinotopic alignment of superficial and deep cortical sites was used to optimize alignment of the recording probe with the axis of the apical dendrite. During the above network states, we studied BPAPs generated spontaneously, antidromically (from corticotectal neurons), or via intense synaptic drive caused by natural visual stimulation. Surprisingly, the invasion of BPAPs as far as 800 microm from the soma was little affected by the network state and only mildly attenuated by high firing frequencies. These data reveal that the BPAP is a robust and highly reliable property of neocortical apical dendrites. These events, therefore, are well suited to provide crucial signals for the control of synaptic plasticity during information-processing brain states.", "pages": "1152-3"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Cicerone: stereotactic neurophysiological recording and deep brain stimulation electrode placement software system.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17846266", "authors": ["Miocinovic, S", "Noecker, AM", "Maks, CB", "Butson, CR", "McIntyre, CC"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

TS mainly occurs in boys, and shows genetic heritability with differing penetrance. The pathological mechanism is still unclear Neuroanatomical and neuroimaging studies, as well as effective treatment using antipsychotics, suggest that a disturbance of the dopaminergic system in the basal ganglia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TS. Several possibly causative mechanisms of the disturbed dopaminergic neurotransmission are discussed, with the main emphasis on the-infection-triggered-inflammatory immune process. Extrapyramidal movement disorders are known to occur as a symptom of poststreptococcal disease, such as in Sydenham's chorea. Cases of childhood TS are proposed to be caused by such a poststreptococcal mechanism, being part of a spectrum of childhood neurobehavioral disorders termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). The overlap between TS and PANDAS is discussed, and a critical view of the PANDAS concept is presented. The therapeutic implications of the different pathological mechanisms are described, taking into consideration not only the acute or chronic natures of different infections, but also an autoimmune process.

Studies reveal a variety of apparently discrepant results. At the least, it is unclear which DBS effects are therapeutically effective. This systematic review attempts to organize current DBS research into a series of unifying themes or issues such as whether the therapeutic effects are local or systems-wide or whether the effects are related to inhibition or excitation. A number of alternative hypotheses are offered for consideration including suppression of abnormal activity, striping basal ganglia output of misinformation, reduction of abnormal stochastic resonance effects due to increased noise in the disease state, and reinforcement of dynamic modulation of neuronal activity by resonance effects.", "pages": "1152-3"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus stimulation for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "16381180", "authors": ["Sun, B", "Chen, S", "Zhan, S", "Le, W", "Krahl, SE"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement", "abstract": "Inhibitory control may be affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) due to impairment within the non-motor basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. The present study aimed to identify the effects of chronic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on lexical-semantic inhibitory control. Eighteen participants with PD who had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN, completed a picture-word interference (PWI) task and the Hayling test in on and off stimulation conditions. The results of PD participants were compared with 21 non-neurologically impaired control participants. PD participants performed no differently from controls on the PWI task, and no significant differences between on and off stimulation conditions were revealed, therefore suggesting that PD participants are not impaired in lexical-semantic interference control. In contrast, in the off stimulation condition, PD participants had significantly delayed reaction times and increased errors on the inhibition section of the Hayling test compared with the STN stimulation condition and control participants. These results suggest that PD patients are impaired in aspects of inhibitory control that are dependent on behavioural inhibition (such as the suppression of prepotent responses) and selection from competing alternatives without the presence of external cues. Furthermore, STN stimulation acts to restore these behavioural inhibitory processes.", "pages": "1152-3"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for treatment of cervical dystonia.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "16434672", "authors": ["Krauss, JK"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

Apomorphine infusion reduced daily off time but did not improve dyskinesia; long-term treatment was associated with impulse control disorders. STN-DBS provided motor benefit, but was associated with behavioural changes including attempted suicide. Duodenal levodopa produced significant clinical benefit without behavioural changes and allowed patients to discontinue all other PD medications.

STN-DBS is the prevalent surgical therapy for PD and has shown efficacy, but behavioural disorders, including cognitive problems, depression and suicidality have been reported.
