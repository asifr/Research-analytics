This has led to the development of a multimodal onset stimulation therapy (MEOS), which the neurosurgical intensive care unit administers during an early phase of rehabilitation to patients who have been in a coma for more than 48 hours after trauma. This study, which was carried out over a period of 2 years, focuses on 89 patients aged 16-65 years suffering from severe brain injury. Sixteen of these (age mean: 43.6 years) fulfil the criteria required to start the MEOS. The authors were able to identify significant changes in two of the patients' vegetative parameters (viz. heart and respiratory frequencies), even in cases of deep coma (GCS 3-4). The most significant changes were caused by tactile and acoustic stimulation. Standardized behavioural assessment turned out to be particularly advisable in cases of medium coma. Here, too, a stimulation of the tactile and acoustic senses resulted mainly in head and eye movements.", "pages": "585-94"}, {"volume": "93", "title": "Long-term deep brain stimulation in a patient with essential tremor: clinical response and postmortem correlation with stimulator termination sites in ventral thalamus.

The authors report on a woman with essential tremor in whom chronic bilateral DBS directed to the ventral thalamus produced adequate tremor suppression until her death from unrelated causes 16 months after placement of the electrodes. Neuropathological postmortem studies of the brain in this patient demonstrated that both stimulators terminated in the Vim region of the thalamus, and that chronic DBS elicited minor reactive changes confined to the immediate vicinity of the electrode tracks.

Despite the lack of other disabling motor symptoms, the tremor of tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease can be very disabling, especially if a postural and kinetic component exists. A wide variety of treatments for Parkinson's disease tremor are currently available and include use of oral medications, injections with botulinum toxin and neurosurgical procedures. Some of the first line medications (levodopa, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics) are very effective in controlling tremor. However, some patients with Parkinson's disease tremors are unresponsive to first line drugs and treatment with second line medications (clozapine, amantadine, clonazepam, propranolol, neurontin) should be attempted. In the small number of patients with disabling tremor that is refractory to all medications, neurosurgical intervention should be considered.

To evaluate the consistency of these statements, we reviewed hundreds of papers and congress reports on MER- and non-MER-guided procedures published since 1992. This review showed that MER groups published more often than non-MER groups. While side effects of surgery were not uncommon in both groups, the rate of severe complications, such as hematoma, and mortality appeared to be higher when microelectrodes were used, both in ablative surgery and in DBS procedures. Besides, the nonaccurate placement of lesions or DBS electrodes, as assessed on published MRI figures, was not uncommon in MER publications. Lesion volume was, when reported, not different in both techniques. The electrical parameters of stimulation of implanted electrodes in the thalamic ventral intermediate (Vim) nucleus for treatment of tremor were higher in MER-guided surgery. The available literature suggests that MER techniques may increase the risks of surgery without enhancing its accuracy, compared to MRI-based macrostimulation techniques. To date, there is no randomized trial by one and the same group on the use of micro- versus macroelectrodes in surgery for movement disorders. A prerequisite for such a trial in the future must imply that the investigators have an equal nonprejudiced attitude towards, and equal confidence and experience in, either technique.

These papers were scrutinised with respect to redundancies or other overlap of reported patients. The resulting numbers of patients were compiled according to gender, to surgical procedure, and to geographic area of origin of the publishing centers.In one third of the reviewed publications the gender of the patients was not specified. In the remaining papers, the overall sex distribution of patients who underwent surgery was 35% females and 65% males. These proportions between sexes were relatively consistent regardless of surgical procedure, and regardless of geographic origin of the publications.Male preponderance in patients undergoing surgery for PD cannot be explained by a corresponding difference in gender-prevalence of the disease.

For comparison purposes, recordings were made from deep pyramidal cells, which are also present in layer III. These two cell types could be distinguished both anatomically and physiologically. Anatomically, the layer III non-pyramidal neuron displayed smooth beady dendrites, while deep pyramidal cells showed thicker dendrites with spines. The dendrites of the layer III non-pyramidal neuron also tended to be restricted to layer III while deep pyramidal cells had long apical dendrites that spanned layers I and II. Although the resting membrane potentials of both cell types were very similar, significant differences were noted in other physiological measures. Layer III non-pyramidal neurons typically displayed higher input resistances, faster time constants, smaller spike amplitudes, shorter spike widths, and higher spike thresholds. In addition, layer III non-pyramidal neurons were able to spike at much higher rates when stimulated with the same level of threshold normalized current injection. The most dramatic differences in physiology were seen in the pattern of spiking in response to increasing levels of positive constant current pulses. Layer III non-pyramidal neurons showed qualitatively different responses at low and high levels of stimulation. At low levels, spikes occurred with long latency and the firing frequency increased throughout the duration of the current pulse. At high levels, non-pyramidal neurons started spiking with short latency, followed by a decrease in firing frequency, which in turn was followed by an increase in firing frequency. Deep pyramidal neurons differed dramatically from this pattern, displaying a qualitatively similar response at all levels of current injection. This response was characterized by short latency spikes and spike adaptation for the duration of the current pulse.", "pages": "585-94"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Advances in neurostimulation for movement disorders.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10769817", "authors": ["Gross, RE", "Lozano, AM"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Neurological research", "abstract": "Rapid angular displacements of the wrist evoke cerebral potentials that precede the onset of the long-latency electromyographic (EMG) activity generated in muscles stretched by the displacement. The initial segment of the long-latency EMG activity (termed the M2 response) is thought to be mediated by a transcortical reflex. We used dipole source analysis to examine the source generators of the early components of the cerebral potentials and their relationship to the timing and magnitude of the M2 response. Subjects (n=10) were presented with instructions to either actively flex or extend the wrist in response to a torque motor-imposed extensor displacement or allow the wrist to be passively extended. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were obtained from 32 scalp-surface electrodes, and EMG was recorded from the wrist flexors and extensors. For all three tasks, the M2 response was preceded by cerebral potentials that could be explained by a three-dipole model. One source generator localised to deep within the cerebrum, and the other two localised to the region of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. We used the P20-N20 dipole evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist, corresponding to synaptic activity within cortical area 3b, as a local spatial reference to examine the contributions of the pre- and postcentral cortex. This analysis showed that one of the sensorimotor dipoles was consistently located anterior to the P20-N20 dipole at a displacement (average 11.5 mm) appropriate for a generator originating within the deep layers of area 4 on the anterior bank of the central sulcus. The orientation of this dipole was also consistent with a precentral generator and not a reversal of the potentials generated by input to area 3b. The time course of the area-4 dipole moment (onset =35 ms, peak =54 ms) was appropriate to reflect synaptic activity onto corticospinal neurons whose descending volleys mediate the M2 response. Comparisons across tasks showed that the magnitude of the M2 was modulated with task instruction, being largest with active and smallest with passive resistance. In contrast, the magnitude of the early evoked potentials (up to 75 ms) did not grade across tasks. We interpret these results as suggesting that instruction-dependent modulation of the M2 response occurs downstream from inputs to the primary motor cortex.", "pages": "585-94"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Surgery for levodopa-induced dyskinesias.", "issue": "4 Suppl 1", "pmid": "10762148", "authors": ["Lang, AE"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Previous case reports supported the presence of the uncrossed pyramidal tract in exceptional patients.

The study presents the computer research on basic biophysical phenomena of electroshock therapy (flow of electric current in the structures of the head just before convulsive attack).

The model was subjected to the action of electric stimulation (parameters identical to those applied in clinical conditions). Analysis of the flow in particular layers revealed the crawling/spreading effect present not only in the scalp layer but also in the layer of cerebrospinal fluid. The effect is conditioned by \"deeper situated\" lesser conduction of electricity-respectively skull bones, brain tissue. Crawling effect is the reason why only 5-15% of the electricity applied on the surface of the head reaches the surface of the brain. Electro-stimulation examinations also showed that the values of the so called density of the current in layers of brain tissue balanced between 1-10 mA/mm2. The current parameters of ECT were effective in evoking subsequent convulsive attack and safe for the brain tissue. The model was subjected to the action of magnetic stimulation according to the parameters of neurologic technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

Besides the original brainstem wild running and tonic-clonic seizures, new behavioral patterns appear resembling those of electrical amygdala kindling.

Our objective was to use electrophysiology to test the hypothesis of gradual and sequential involvement of the amygdala and then cortex during audiogenic kindling. We used video-EEG recordings with cortical and deep electrode implants (inferior colliculus and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei) during audiogenic kindling on eight WARs, and their respective controls, submitted to a protocol of three acoustic stimuli per day. A new design for 'on site' source follower circuits was used in order to minimize noise during the recording of EEG data from the wild running episode and the subsequent tonic-clonic or motor limbic seizures. The video-EEG equipment assembled allowed synchronous recordings of both behavior and EEG. WARs first recordings showed electrodecremental responses after seizure onset and a probable epileptiform activity, particularly in the inferior colliculus, during the tonic phase of seizure. All animals showed very similar polyspike-wave activity in the amygdala, after behavioral seizure patterns (Racine's scale) occurred.

Further, the therapeutic effect of DBS may be due to driving neurons at higher and perhaps more importantly, regular frequencies. There were simulations in which information transfer was augmented suggesting the presence of stochastic resonance. This most often occurred with low frequency activity in the target neuron.

Using a brain slice preparation, we performed whole-cell patch recordings from neurons in the regions overlapping the functionally defined AT. Local electrical stimulation activated synaptic inputs to neurons in these regions, collectively termed the deep aPC (daPC). Synaptic inputs were blocked by selective ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Excitatory bursts were evoked from 59% of daPC neurons as the stimulus intensity was raised above a precise threshold. Secondary bursts (6-15 Hz) occurred in 34% of daPC neurons. Evoked bursts were synaptically driven, as they were blocked by TTX (1 microM) or 2, 3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX, 1 microM), but not by inclusion of cesium and N-(2, 6-dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl) triethylammonium (QX-314) in the internal patch solution. Neither augmentation of excitatory nor suppression of inhibitory transmission were required to evoke bursts from daPC neurons. However, bicuculline (20 microM) lowered the threshold intensity for evoking discharges and increased the incidence and duration of evoked bursts, indicating active inhibitory control of daPC neurons. Stimulation in the daPC evoked epileptiform field potentials from layer II of the adjacent PC and bursts from layer II pyramidal neurons. This work demonstrates that synaptically dependent excitatory burst discharges can be evoked from daPC neurons without altering the balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition. Stimuli that trigger bursts in daPC neurons also generate epileptiform activity in layer II pyramidal cells, indicating that propagation of excitatory activity triggered from the daPC to the pyramidal neurons of the aPC can contribute to the initiation of seizures induced by disinhibition of the AT in vivo.", "pages": "585-94"}, {"volume": "851", "title": "Site- and modality-specific modulation of experimental muscle pain in humans.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "7381790", "authors": ["Svensson, P", "Hashikawa, CH", "Casey, KL"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that neural activation causes changes in cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO), i.e. increases in tissue levels of oxy-Hb and total-Hb with a decrease in deoxy-Hb concentration.

The potential reversibility of cognitive dysfunction after chronic electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) for PD has lead some to favor this treatment modality over ablation. This paper reviews the initial studies of the cognitive effects of thalamic, pallidal, and subthalamic DBS.

The electrically evoked C-fibre responses were inhibited to 53% of baseline 15-30 min after injection of capsaicin. This inhibition was only slightly attenuated by 125 nmol of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine or 250 nmol of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone applied directly onto the spinal cord when the two compounds were administered separately 5 min before capsaicin. In contrast, when a mixture of the two compounds was given 5 min before capsaicin, the effect of capsaicin was completely abolished. These results indicate that activation of the capsaicin-sensitive afferents in the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle inhibits the electrically evoked C-fibre responses in the dorsal horn by activating noradrenergic and opioidergic inhibitory systems. Moreover, our data indicate that the activation of these two systems following injection of capsaicin has a sub-additive inhibitory effect on the wide dynamic range neurones in the spinal cord.

The response had a jittering latency and failed to follow high frequency stimuli, indicating trans-synaptic (orthodromic) events. Moreover, the predorsal bundle stimulation-evoked orthodromic response could be made to collide with the response to a preceding stimulation of the optic chiasm, suggesting that burst-firing cells received excitatory inputs from the axonal collaterals of predorsal bundle-projecting cells. 3. Stimulation of the predorsal bundle could evoke an IPSP in predorsal bundle-projecting cells. The latency of the IPSP was 0.5-1.0 ms longer than the orthodromic response in burst-firing cells. Simultaneous recordings showed that the IPSP in predorsal bundle-projecting cells was preceded by a burst of extracellular spikes from burst-firing cells with short latency ( approximately 0.9 ms), indicating an inhibitory monosynaptic connection from burst-firing cells to predorsal bundle-projecting cells. 4. Burst-firing cells exhibited a prolonged depression after the predorsal bundle or optic chiasm stimulation due to an inhibitory postsynaptic potential.

This study examines the excitatory and inhibitory processes that take place in this layer using an in vitro slice preparation and field potentials evoked by stimulation of primary afferent fibers in the deep fiber layer of ELL. The postsynaptic response to stimulation of the afferent fibers was still present after blocking chemical transmission in three different ways: by adding glutamate receptor antagonists to the medium, by substituting a nominally calcium-free medium for normal medium, and by blocking calcium channels with cadmium. Blockade of chemical transmission was demonstrated by disappearance of control responses to parallel fiber stimulation. The continued presence of a postsynaptic response in the absence of chemical excitation is consistent with previous anatomic and physiological evidence for electrical synapses between afferent fibers and granular cells in ELL. Granular cell activation by primary afferent fibers was followed by a powerful, short-latency inhibition mediated by GABA and GABA(A) receptors, as indicated by a large increase in the postsynaptic response to afferent fiber stimulation following application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Bicuculline caused a marked increase of the postsynaptic response even after chemical synaptic excitation had been blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists, by a calcium-free medium, or by cadmium. Thus activation of the inhibitory interneurons responsible for GABA release did not require chemical excitation. Nonchemical excitation of the inhibitory interneurons could be mediated either by electrical synapses between afferent fibers and inhibitory interneurons, or by nonsynaptic activation of the large GABAergic terminals that are known to be present on granular cells. The marked increase of the postsynaptic response caused by bicuculline in a calcium-free medium or in the presence of cadmium suggests that the release of GABA by inhibitory terminals was not entirely dependent on calcium influx. This effect of bicuculline on the postsynaptic response in a calcium-free medium or in the presence of cadmium was markedly reduced by prior addition of the GABA transporter antagonist, nipecotic acid. Thus calcium-independent release of GABA may occur in ELL and may be partly dependent on reversal of a GABA transporter.

Annual Symposium. AMIA Symposium", "abstract": "The activity of neurons located in the deep intermediate and adjacent deep layers (hereafter called just deep intermediate layer neurons) of the superior colliculus (SC) in monkeys was recorded during saccades interrupted by electrical stimulation of the brainstem omnipause neuron (OPN) region. The goal of the experiment was to determine if these neurons maintained their discharge during the saccadic interruption, and thus, could potentially provide a memory trace for the intended movement which ends accurately on target in spite of the perturbation. The collicular neurons recorded in the present study were located in the rostral three-fifths of the colliculus. Most of these cells tended to show considerable presaccadic activity during a delayed saccade paradigm, and, therefore, probably overlap with the population of SC cells called buildup neurons or prelude bursters in previous studies. The effect of electrical stimulation in the OPN region (which interrupted ongoing saccades) on the discharge of these neurons was measured by computing the percentage reduction in a cell's activity compared to that present during non-interrupted saccades. During saccade interruption about 70% of deep intermediate layer neurons experienced a major reduction (30% or greater) in their activity, but discharge recovered quickly after the termination of the stimulation as the eyes resumed their movement to finish the saccade on the target. Therefore, the pattern of activity recorded in most of the deep intermediate layer neurons during interrupted saccades qualitatively resembled that previously reported for the saccade-related burst neurons which tend to be located more dorsally in the intermediate layer. In contrast, some of our cells (30%) showed little or no perturbation in their activity caused by the saccade interrupting stimulation. Because all the more dorsally located burst neurons and the majority of our deep intermediate layer neurons show a total or major suppression in their discharge during interrupted saccades, it seems unlikely that the colliculus by itself could maintain an accurate memory of the desired saccadic goal or the remaining dynamic motor error required to account for the accuracy of the resumed movement which occurs following the interruption. However, it remains possible that the smaller proportion of our neurons whose activity was not perturbed during interrupted movements could play a role in the mechanisms underlying saccade accuracy in the interrupted saccade paradigm. Interrupted saccades have longer durations than normal saccades to the same target. Therefore, we investigated whether the discharge of our deeper collicular cells was also necessarily prolonged during interrupted saccades, and, if so, how the prolongation compared to the prolongation of the saccade. Sixty percent of our sample neurons showed a prolongation in discharge that was approximately the same as the prolongation in saccade duration (difference < 15 ms in magnitude). The, observation that temporal discharge in our neurons was perturbed to roughly match saccadic temporal perturbation suggests that dynamic feedback about ongoing saccadic motion is provided to the colliculus, but does not necessarily imply that this structure is the site responsible for the computation of dynamic motor error.", "pages": "585-94"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Neuropsychological and quality of life outcome after thalamic stimulation for essential tremor.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "2985418", "authors": ["Tr\u00f6ster, AI", "Fields, JA", "Pahwa, R", "Wilkinson, SB", "Strait-Tr\u00f6ster, KA", "Lyons, K", "Kieltyka, J", "Koller, WC"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Ten years ago we had no more than informed speculations about the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and our ability to give these patients relief was so limited that neuroablative therapy or even deep brain stimulation via an implanted electrode was often the only hope.

Voltage imaging previously located the sites of epileptiform discharge onset in slices of rat piriform cortex and revealed the spatiotemporal pattern of development of two types of electrical activity during the latent period prior to discharge onset. A ramplike depolarization (onset activity) appears at the site of discharge onset. Onset activity is preceded by a sustained low-amplitude depolarization (plateau activity) at another site, which shows little if any overlap with the site of onset. Because synaptic blockade at either of these two sites blocks discharges, it was proposed that both forms of latent period activity are necessary for the generation of epileptiform discharges and that the onset and plateau sites work together in the amplification of electrical activity. The capacity for amplification was examined here by studying subthreshold responses in slices of piriform cortex using two different in vitro models of epilepsy. Under some conditions electrically evoked responses showed a nonlinear dependence on stimulus current, suggesting amplification by strong polysynaptic excitatory responses. The sites of plateau and onset activity were mapped for different in vitro models of epilepsy and different sites of stimulation. These experiments showed that the site of plateau activity expanded into deep layers of neighboring neocortex in parallel with expansions of the onset site into neocortex. These results provide further evidence that interactions between the sites of onset and plateau activity play an important role in the initiation of epileptiform discharges. The site of plateau activity showed little variation with different stimulation sites in the piriform cortex, but when stimulation was applied in the endopiriform nucleus (in the sites of onset of plateau activity), plateau activity had a lower amplitude and became distributed over a much wider area. These results indicate that in the initiation of epileptiform discharges, the location of the circuit that generates plateau activity is not rigidly defined but can exhibit flexibility.", "pages": "585-94"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Hippocampal theta-related cellular activity in the superior colliculus of the urethane-anesthetized rat.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "7897487", "authors": ["Natsume, K", "Hallworth, NE", "Szgatti, TL", "Bland, BH"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Hippocampus", "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to examine the different treatment approaches for persons with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and to examine the effects of these treatments on speech.

The use and efficacy of acupuncture treatment are not yet widely accepted in Western scientific and medical communities. Demonstration of regionally specific, quantifiable acupuncture effects on relevant structures of the human brain would facilitate acceptance and integration of this therapeutic modality into the practice of modern medicine. Research with animal models of acupuncture indicates that many of the beneficial effects may be mediated at the subcortical level in the brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of acupuncture in normal subjects and to provide a foundation for future studies on mechanisms of acupuncture action in therapeutic interventions. Acupuncture needle manipulation was performed at Large Intestine 4 (LI 4, Hegu) on the hand in 13 subjects [Stux, 1997]. Needle manipulation on either hand produced prominent decreases of fMRI signals in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24), caudate, putamen, temporal pole, and insula in all 11 subjects who experienced acupuncture sensation. In marked contrast, signal increases were observed primarily in the somatosensory cortex. The two subjects who experienced pain instead of acupuncture sensation exhibited signal increases instead of decreases in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24), caudate, putamen, anterior thalamus, and posterior insula. Superficial tactile stimulation to the same area elicited signal increases in the somatosensory cortex as expected, but no signal decreases in the deep structures.

The process of this propagation was clearly divided into three steps. The first step was a fast conduction process in the superficial layers of the subiculum, which might arise from propagation of action potentials directly evoked by the stimulation. The second one was a slow process around the boundary between the subiculum and PCC, during which significant signal enhancement was observed via a pathway in the middle to deep layers. The third step was a slow propagating process along the superficial layers of PCC. Application of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, CNQX, restricted propagation in the first step, suggesting that a synaptic relay exists between the first and second steps. In the rest of the slices (87 out of 98), signal propagation showed only the first step in response to electrical stimulation. However, when bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, was applied to these slices, the signal propagation spread into PCC in a manner indistinguishable from the one characterized above.
