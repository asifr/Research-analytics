Here, we extend this preliminary experience by reporting long-term outcome in a multicenter case series, following 12 patients (6 women, 6 men) with Meige syndrome for up to 78 months after bilateral GPi DBS.

To identify the motor territories in the external (GPe) and internal (GPi) segments of the GP, unitary responses evoked by stimulation of the primary motor cortex were observed by constructing peristimulus time histograms. Neurons in the motor territories of the GPe and GPi responded to cortical stimulation. Response patterns observed in the PD patients were combinations of an early excitation, an inhibition, and a late excitation. In addition, in the CD patient, a long-lasting inhibition was prominent, suggesting increased activity along the cortico-striato-GPe/GPi pathways. The firing rates of GPe and GPi neurons in the CD patient were lower than those in the PD patients. Many GPe and GPi neurons of the PD and CD patients showed burst or oscillatory burst activity. Effective cathodal contacts tended to be located close to the responding neurons.

In this work, a previously proposed method for identifying sub-regions within the thalamus based on differences in their T1 and T2 values is explored in detail. The effect on the segmentation of T1 and T2 dependence weighted against priors for spatial position and extent was investigated. When T1 and T2 dependence was highly weighted, good distinction between identified regions was obtained in T1/T2 feature-space, but no contiguous anatomically distinct regions were identified within the thalamus. Incorporating spatial priors was necessary to ensure anatomically distinct regions were defined. Optimal values for segmentation parameters were obtained by assessing performance on a 'synthetic thalamus'. Using these optimum input parameters, within- and between-subjects reproducibility was assessed. Good reproducibility was obtained when six regions were specified to be identified in the thalamus. The six regions identified were similar in the majority of the normal subject group. However, intriguingly these regions were different from those obtained in the same subjects using a well-known connectivity-based segmentation technique. This method shows promise to identify intrathalamic structures on the basis of T1 and T2 signal.

TMS has been shown to be a reliable tool for measuring plastic changes in the motor cortex associated with interventions in the motor system, such as motor training and motor cortex stimulation. In addition, as illustrated by the experience in promoting recovery from stroke, TMS is a promising therapeutic tool to minimize motor, speech, cognitive, and mood deficits.

Polymorphisms in the human genes coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and apolipoprotein E have been studied in the context of plasticity and stroke recovery and are discussed here in detail.

Cell proliferation (Ki-67 immuno-positive-cells) and survival (bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-immuno-positive cells) were assessed in the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb continuum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of hemiparkinsonian rats with or without continuous STN-HFS for 8 days. Dopamine lesion impaired cell proliferation and survival through different mechanisms, the effect on proliferation being correlated to the level of dopamine depletion whereas the effect on survival was not. Prolonged STN-HFS did not affect cell proliferation, but increased cell survival bilaterally. In these regions of constitutive neurogenesis, the percentage of new neuroblasts (BrdU-doublecortin-positive cells) was unchanged, suggesting that STN-HFS can lead to a net increase in newly formed neurons later on. STN-HFS also increased new cell survival in the striatum and promoted dopamine system recovery detected by tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining.

Serotonergic modulation is known to play an important role in the regulation of theta rhythm. 5-HT2c receptors represent a specific target of psychopharmacology and, in particular, the behavioral effects of the 5-HT2c receptor agonist mCPP have been thoroughly tested. The present study used this compound and the selective 5-HT2c receptor antagonist SB-242084 to elucidate the role of 5-HT2c receptors in the generation of hippocampal oscillations. Hippocampal EEG was recorded and the power in the theta frequency range was monitored in different behaviors in freely-moving rats and after brainstem stimulation in anesthetized animals. We found that in freely-moving rats, mCPP suppressed hippocampal theta rhythm and the effect was stronger during REM sleep than during waking theta states. Under urethane anesthesia, mCPP decreased the power for both spontaneous and elicited theta rhythm in a dose-dependent manner and the 5-HT2c antagonist reversed this effect. The results of this study demonstrate that 5-HT2c receptors are important element of the serotonergic modulation of hippocampal theta oscillations and thus pharmacological interactions with these receptors can modulate physiological and pathological processes associated with limbic theta activity.", "pages": "e60-1; author reply e62"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Evaluation of minimally invasive excisional brain biopsy and intracranial brachytherapy catheter placement in dogs.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "17678546", "authors": ["Hariz, GM", "Nakajima, T", "Limousin, P", "Foltynie, T", "Zrinzo, L", "Jahanshahi, M", "Hamberg, K"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "This article describes a two-year surveillance of neurosurgical site infections and an outbreak of infections in deep brain stimulation (DBS) cases.

Depth recordings also allow us to study LFP power spectra during different types of limb movements, thus helping to elucidate the role of the basal ganglia in specific motor tasks. Accordingly, we recorded bilateral LFP activity from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients with PD (n=9) and from the globus pallidus internum (GPi) of patients with dystonia (n=8). Recordings were taken during the performance of repetitive passive, active and ballistic fast extensions and flexions of the elbow joint and during rest. The first result was that the frequency spectra varied task-specifically in a similar fashion in GPi and STN. The amplitude of the alpha frequency on the contralateral side was significantly higher in ballistic fast movements compared with rest, passive and active performance in both STN and GPi. In conclusion, ballistic fast movements cause synchronized basal ganglia activity in the alpha range. Because this was seen in both patient groups (PD and dystonia) we consider this activity as task-specific rather than disease-related.", "pages": "e60-1; author reply e62"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Activation of subthalamic neurons by contralateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19107749", "authors": ["Walker, HC", "Watts, RL", "Schrandt, CJ", "Huang, H", "Guthrie, SL", "Guthrie, BL", "Montgomery, EB"], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "Camptocormia is recognised as a severe postural movement disorder complicating neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) and multisystem atrophy. Pathophysiologically two main hypotheses are discussed: (i) a disorder of the basal ganglia resulting in axial dystonia and rigidity on the one hand and (ii) an extensor truncal myopathy on the other hand. Therapeutic efforts often result in limited success. Therefore, reports on improvements by deep brain stimulation (DBS) are of great interest. However, the role of DBS in the treatment of camptocormia remains unclear. Here, we report a female PD patient who responded well to DBS of the subthalamic nucleus for severe dyskinesias and fluctuations. However, after 6 months she started to develop a rapidly progressing camptocormia which did not respond to DBS. The clinical and electrophysiological examination suggested a truncal erector myopathy. The inconsistent reports on the effects of DBS on camptocormia in PD patients suggest heterogeneous pathogenetic pathways. A pathophysiological subtype with predominant basal ganglia dysfunction and responsivity to DBS, however, seems to be rather rare. A myopathy, in contrast, seems to be more frequent and DBS is not effective in this condition. Therefore, camptocormia in PD patients is not an established indication for DBS.", "pages": ""}]
