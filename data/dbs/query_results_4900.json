Results showed that electrode potentials were modulated by BP and respiration and could be detected as a specific component of the compound LFP signals with a mean (+/-S.D.) amplitude of 6.9+/-1.7 microV. The detection rate and amplitude of the modulated electrode potentials were independent from brain regions and neurological disorders.

To date, DBS of the globus pallidus interna and subthalamic nucleus has been reported to relieve motor symptoms and levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. DBS also has different advantages over pallidotomy and subthalamotomy, including reversibility, decreased risk of reoperation and decreased morbidity.

Different atlases, as well as different parameterizations of the registration algorithm, lead to different and somewhat independent atlas-based predictions.

When stage 5-kindled seizures were achieved by daily amygdala kindling, high frequency stimulation was delivered to the SNr bilaterally 1 s after cessation of kindling.

It encompasses neuropsychiatric medical devices, such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). As a therapeutic approach to affective disorders, neuromodulation shifts the focus from the monoamine synapse to neural circuitry of the brain, which is dysregulated in depression. This neural circuitry has been elaborated on over the course of 15 years of neuroimaging research in mood disorders and is now believed to encompass disturbances in a frontolimbic network. These include reduced metabolism and blood flow in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate and pathologically increased activity in the subgenual cingulate and amygdala.VNS is an implanted device that has established efficacy in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe, recurrent unipolar and bipolar depression in July of 2005. VNS adopts a bottom-up approach to modulating the neural circuitry of depression by stimulating vagal afferent fibers in the neck, which carry impulses to the brain stem to target there the locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus. Now that VNS has moved beyond the experimental phase and into the clinic, psychiatrists are faced with deciding who is an appropriate patient for this surgical implant and how to integrate VNS into existing treatment in order to optimize both efficacy and safety.This review of VNS will assess the efficacy and safety data that led to the FDA approval.

This device can be used to investigate the mechanisms by which deep brain stimulation can ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, and also may be the basis for a new clinical tool for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, by capitalizing on the high spatial specificity of intranuclear microstimulation. The array includes 16 activated iridium microelectrodes, 5-6 mm in length, within a cluster approximately 1.8 mm in diameter. We have fabricated the array using materials carrying the USP Category VI classification, and we have developed an apparatus and a procedure for implanting the microelectrode arrays into the deep brain. Ten arrays have been implanted into the STN of domestic cats, and one into the internal segment of the globus pallidus, for 140-415 days. During that time, we were able to record action potentials from individual neurons, on 4 to 8 of the 16 channels. The microelectrode' active surface areas ranged from 500 to 2000 microm2. Controlled-current pulses, 26.5 microA in amplitude and 150 micros/phase in duration (4 nC/phase) were used to excite neurons in the cat's STN. In addition to direct activation, the stimulus modulated the neuronal activity over a distance of at least 1.2 mm from the site of stimulation. These parameters did not induce histologically detectable changes around the tip sites after 35 hours of stimulation at 100 Hz (7 hours of stimulation per day, on 5 successive days), if the electrode' active surface area was 1000 microm2 or greater.", "pages": "238-43"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Basal ganglia neural responses during behaviorally effective deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in rats performing a treadmill locomotion test.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "16676910", "authors": ["Shi, LH", "Luo, F", "Woodward, DJ", "Chang, JY"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Synapse (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "A 24-year-old male suffered from acute-onset right-sided hemiparesis, dysarthria, and ophthalmoplegia in February 2001.

Rubral tremor was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical presentation and tremography analysis. Rubral tremor is not unusual, and pharmacotherapy is nearly always ineffective in clinical practice. Deep brain stimulation, thalamotomy, and pallidotomy are all considered effective according to recent research. However, they are either very expensive or invasive, and involve surgical risks. In our patient, we tried valproate, clonazepam, and verapamil one after another, but all in vain. Finally, titration of trihexyphenidyl provided significant benefit. The tremor was successfully controlled by a single high daily dose of trihexyphenidyl (38 mg) without severe or uncomfortable side effects.

Moreover, the enhancement reversed in parallel with body weight recovery when ad libitum access to food was reinstated. The present study tested the hypothesis that hypoleptinemia during food restriction is necessary for expression of enhanced drug reward. In Experiment 1, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of leptin (0.5 microg/0.5 microl/hr for 8 days) in food-restricted rats did not alter the rewarding effect of D-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Considering that i.c.v. leptin may not diffuse into deep brain regions where direct effects on drug reward sensitivity may be exerted, effects of acute bilateral microinjection of leptin (0.5 microg) in ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens were tested in Experiment 2 and found to have no effect. In Experiment 3, chronic i.c.v. leptin infusion in ad libitum fed rats decreased food intake and body weight and enhanced the rewarding effect of D-amphetamine. Sensitivity to D-amphetamine returned to normal as body weight recovered following cessation of leptin infusion. This result suggests that weight loss, whether from hormone-induced appetite suppression or experimenter-imposed food restriction, is sufficient to enhance drug reward sensitivity. Experiment 4 tested whether food restriction in the absence of body weight loss alters drug reward sensitivity. Rats received chronic i.c.v. infusion of the orexigenic melanocortin receptor antagonist, SHU9119 (0.02 microg/0.5 microl/hr for 12 days), and a subset were pair-fed to vehicle-infused controls. Although these subjects ingested approximately 50% of the amount of food ingested by free-feeding SHU9119-infused rats, they displayed no weight loss and no change in sensitivity to D-amphetamine. Together, results of this study support the importance of weight loss, but not leptin, in the enhancement of drug reward sensitivity.", "pages": "238-43"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus affects resting EEG and visual evoked potentials in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "16676908", "authors": ["Jech, R", "R\u016fzicka, E", "Urgos\u00edk, D", "Serranov\u00e1, T", "Volfov\u00e1, M", "Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, O", "Roth, J", "Dusek, P", "Mec\u00edr, P"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "To investigate whether the early effects of voluntary teeth clenching (VTC) among the first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles are differently modulated depending on their muscle properties, we examined the responses of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation with selected current directions and by brainstem magnetic stimulation (BMS). Although MEP responses with anterior-medially current direction (preferentially elicited I1-waves) were facilitated in all three muscles, those responses with posterior-laterally current direction (preferentially elicited I3-waves) were different among FDI, ADM, and APB muscles. That is, MEP responses in FDI and APB muscles were significantly reduced, whereas those responses in ADM muscle were not significantly reduced. Further, inhibitory effects of VTC in FDI muscle were more potent than those in ADM or APB muscles. On the other hand, the responses to BMS were unchanged by VTC in all three muscles, suggesting that the modulations of MEP were attributed to the cortical origin. On the basis of our previous findings that the inhibitory connections in FDI muscle are more potent than those in ADM muscle (Takahashi et al. in Clin Neurophysiol 116:2757-2764, 2005), the cortical effects of VTC among three hand muscles are differently modulated, depending on muscle properties, presumably the extents of inhibitory connections to corticospinal tract neurons. Considering that the functional capacity in FDI muscle is higher than that in ADM or APB muscles, the cortical inhibitory effect of VTC might contribute to the sophisticated regulation of the motor outputs even during VTC.", "pages": "238-43"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "[Early therapy option for patients with Parkinson disease: deep brain stimulation].", "issue": "7-10", "pmid": "16674765", "authors": ["Butson, CR", "McIntyre, CC"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Krankenpflege Journal", "abstract": "Efficacy of high frequency subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation has been demonstrated in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD).
