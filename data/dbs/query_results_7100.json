In 16 penetrations, neurons responded exclusively to stimulation of skin, hair or nails. In 9 penetrations, neurons were exclusively related to joint manipulation or other types of 'deep' submodality. In 9 penetrations, unidentified neurons were in the majority. In each penetration, the receptive field positions varied considerably on the same finger or encompassed more than one finger. Although neurons of the same submodality, either skin or 'deep' tended to be set in an array, the most adequate stimulus could vary among neurons of a given array. The variability in the receptive field positions or the most adequate stimuli remained constant irrespective of the angle of the electrode penetration in the cortex.

Furthermore, there were a variety of interactions among inputs from separate afferent sources. The observed interactions included spatial facilitation, occlusion and afferent inhibition. The consequence of these interactions was that neuronal responses were shaped by combinations of effects from different topographic regions of the forelimb or of different modalities. The findings are interpreted as indicating a sharing of neurons among pathways to cortical neurons from separate afferent sources.

To determine whether similar projections exist in a marsupial, we explored the GC layer of the cerebellar cortex of anesthetized Virginia opossums using in-depth microelectrode micromapping and juxtathreshold cutaneous natural stimulation techniques. We found: Somatosensory projections to the GC layer exist throughout the mediolateral extent of the folia of the posterior lobe. The anterior lobe was not explored. The submodality of most receptive fields was 'gentle-touch' cutaneous, but some were located in muscle, joint, or other deep-lying structures. Peripheral projections to the GC layer are organized asomatotopically. Adjacent body parts project disjunctively to nonadjacent GC regions, and the overall pattern of peripheral projections forms a patchy columnar mosaic. Many body parts send projections to multiple loci. Ipsilateral projections predominate. Mechanoreceptors from face, snout, mouth and teeth activate the bulk of GC loci on crus I and crus II. The paramedian lobule receives projections from the entire ipsilateral body; the pyramis is activated from hindlimb and forelimb; the uvula from the upper arm and vibrissae. Different folia have different combinations and arrangements of disjunctive patchy peripheral projections. Individual differences in pattern of foliation and body representation occur. Except for differences in mosaic pattern and relative size of different projections, these findings are similar to those in rats and cats.

The cells were isolated in the primary somatosensory cortex of cats anesthetized with barbiturate and classified according to the nature of their response to natural stimuli, the nature of the surrounding multiunit responses to the same stimuli, the response to thalamic stimulation, and their depth in the cortex. To study factors controlling the excitability of somatosensory neurons, their receptive fields were examined in the presence of iontophoretically administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and bicuculline methiodide (BMI). Even when the neurons were depolarized to perithreshold levels with glutamate, or when local inhibitory influences mediated by GABA were antagonized by BMI, the apparent specificity for one class of afferent input was maintained. Neurons responding to stimulation of either cutaneous or deep receptors maintained their modality specificity, and neurons in cutaneous rapidly adapting regions never took on slowly adapting properties. When ejected at currents that did not elicit action potentials, glutamate lowered the threshold for activation by cutaneous stimuli but did not enlarge the receptive field. With larger ejecting currents, the neurons developed an on-going discharge, but even at these higher doses, glutamate did not produce an increase in the receptive-field size. Some neurons in regions of cortex exhibiting slowly adapting multiunit responses were relatively insensitive to glutamate. These cells required four to five times more glutamate to evoke discharges than did most neurons. Other cells, previously unresponsive to somatic stimuli, could be shown to possess distinct cutaneous receptive fields when either glutamate or BMI was ejected in their vicinity. Iontophoretically administered BMI altered the firing pattern of somatosensory neurons, causing them to discharge in bursts of 3-15 impulses. BMI enlarged the receptive-field size of neurons in regions displaying rapidly adapting multiunit background discharges but not in those regions with slowly adapting multiunit discharges. This differential effect of BMI, suggesting that GABA controls receptive-field size in rapidly adapting regions, also indicates that neurons in rapidly adapting regions differ pharmacologically from those in other submodality regions. In all cortical regions, BMI blocked the poststimulus inhibitory period that normally followed thalamic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "A positive feedback loop between spinal cord nociceptive pathways and antinociceptive areas of the cat's brain stem.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "6504550", "authors": ["Cervero, F", "Wolstencroft, JH"], "year": "1984", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "Electrophysiological evidence has been obtained suggesting the presence of reciprocal excitation between descending pathways from the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) and adjacent reticular formation (Ret.F) and spinal cord neurones projecting to these brain stem areas.

Most auditory units in the superior colliculus have sharply delimited receptive fields which form two discrete classes distinguished by their locations and sizes. The remaining units respond to sounds presented at any location. Each auditory unit responds maximally to sounds at a particular horizontal and vertical location within its receptive field, the unit's \"best area.\" The best areas and receptive field borders of a unit are resistant to changes in the intensity of stimulus. The locations of best areas shift systematically as a function of unit position to form a continuous map of auditory space. The horizontal dimension of space is mapped rostrocaudally, and the vertical dimension is mapped mediolaterally. This map corresponds in orientation with the map of visual space. These data permit us to infer the distribution of unit activity elicited by a sound at any given location. Regardless of its location, a sound activates a substantial portion of the superior colliculus. Indeed, sounds at some locations activate nearly all of the auditory units. However the activated portion of the colliculus contains a restricted region of units which are excited to near their maximum firing rates.

Excitation of both compacta and reticulata cells of the substantia nigra (many of the latter being output neurons since they are antidromically activated from the superior colliculus) was the predominant response recorded.

Influences also appeared to originate from SI and SII, but these may have been indirect. Detailed examination of the AES revealed that these corticotectal projections are topographically organized, and stimulation of a given cortical locus was observed to affect only those cells in the SC whose receptive fields overlapped those of cells at the stimulation site. A similar receptive-field register was found between the suprasylvian sulcus and the SC. Within this topographic pattern, considerable convergence was evident and an individual SC cell could be influenced from a surprisingly large cortical area. This was particularly evident within the representation of the forelimb. Thus, an SC cell with a receptive field covering the forelimb and paw could receive convergent input from many cortical cells with receptive fields covering all or restricted portions of this body region. Considerable corticotectal divergence also was observed within this general topographic scheme. For example, a given corticotectal site representing the digits sent projections to many different SC cells that included the digits within their receptive fields. These data are more consistent with a block-to-block than a point-to-point corticotectal projection. Somatosensory corticotectal projections excited only those SC cells that could also be activated by peripheral somatosensory stimuli. Similarly, the caudal AES, which contains auditory cells, excited only those SC cells activated also by peripheral auditory stimuli. Yet convergent influences from both auditory and somatosensory regions of the AES were observed in the SC cells that could be activated by both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. These data indicate that the AES is a major source of excitatory input to cells of the deep laminae of the SC. Since it is these deep laminae cells that project to premotor regions of the brain stem and the spinal cord, it is reasonable to suppose that the AES has a significant impact on the output signals of the SC that initiate the orientation responses to peripheral sensory stimulation.", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "298", "title": "Laminar interactions during neocortical epileptogenesis.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "5867885", "authors": ["Ebersole, JS", "Chatt, AB"], "year": "1984", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Interactions among laminar subpopulations of cat striate cortical neurons were assessed during the evolution of discrete and temporary epileptic foci, which were induced by selective microinjection of penicillin into different cortical layers. Field potentials and multiunit cellular discharges, evoked by selective visual field stimulation, were recorded simultaneously from 3 layers by multibarreled glass microelectrodes. Laminar response profiles at distinct stages of epileptogenesis were characterized for foci induced in superficial pyramidal, middle stellate, and deep pyramidal layers. Layer 4 was verified to be the most susceptible to epileptogenesis. Penicillin's action within this stellate layer appeared to be sufficient for epileptogenesis and was supportative of, if not necessary for, the development of foci originating in pyramidal cell layers. These findings could not be fully appreciated by monitoring only spontaneous interictal spike potentials. Of the two types of neuronal discharge routinely observed, early latency bursting was principally a characteristic of layer 4 stellate populations, whereas longer-latency bursts comparable to paroxysmal depolarization shifts were recorded equally well from both stellate and pyramidal layers. Epileptiform alterations in both field potential and unit responses were quickly evident in cortical laminae having known anatomic connections with the layer where the focus was induced: e.g. in layers 2-3 with layer 4 foci, in layers 5-6 with layers 2-3 foci, and in layer 4 with layers 5-6 foci.

The cells were identified by antidromic activation from the contralateral ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. Electrical stimulation at sites within the periaqueductal gray, the adjacent midbrain reticular formation, or the deep layers of the tectum were found to inhibit the activity of STT cells. In general, midbrain stimulation inhibited the background discharges and the responses of wide dynamic range cells evoked by innocuous and noxious cutaneous stimulation (29 of 37 cases). However, for six cells, midbrain stimulation preferentially inhibited the responses to noxious stimulation. The evoked responses of all 10 high-threshold cells were inhibited. In only two cases was midbrain stimulation ineffective, and no excitatory effects were observed. The mean latency to onset of inhibition resulting from midbrain stimulation was 24.9 +/- 7.2 ms (n = 35). The amount of inhibition produced by midbrain stimulation was graded with stimulus intensity. For example, trains of stimuli (333 Hz) at 50 microA produced a mean inhibition to 81.7 +/- 16.6% of control, while 200 microA resulted in a mean inhibition to 36.3 +/- 21.7%. Not only was the inhibition increased by the use of stronger current intensities, but the duration of inhibition was prolonged. Midbrain stimulation inhibited the responses of STT cells to volleys in both the A-fibers and the C-fibers of the sural nerve. However, there was a selective action in that the responses to C-fiber volleys were more strongly inhibited than were the responses to A-fiber volleys. Lesions placed in the white matter of the upper cervical spinal cord reduced the inhibition produced by stimulation in either the midbrain or the nucleus raphe magnus. The extent to which the inhibition was reduced was proportional to the extent of the cord lesions. However, even when there was an interruption of the entire lateral funiculus on the side of an STT cell and of the dorsal quadrant of the contralateral side, there was still substantial inhibition following stimulation in either brain stem site. It is concluded that while part of the inhibition is mediated by pathways descending in the dorsal lateral funiculus (DLF), at least some depends on pathways coursing through the ventral spinal cord.

Although it depended on antidromic conduction in pyramidal tract fibers for its production, it varied in amplitude, configuration and latency at different sites and at the same sites on repeated trials.

The experiments were designed to investigate the association fiber system, but the results have also revealed new properties of the afferent fiber system from the olfactory bulb and the inhibitory systems within the piriform cortex. Following shock stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the response of pyramidal cells consists of an initial excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) followed by a long-lasting inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The LOT-evoked EPSP consists of two components: an initial monosynaptic followed by a disynaptic component. The monosynaptic EPSP can be isolated by the use of conditioning LOT shocks to block the IPSP and disynaptic EPSP. The disynaptic EPSP can be demonstrated by cutting LOT fibers at the surface of the cortex to eliminate the monosynaptic EPSP and by the use of bicuculline to block the IPSP. The latency of the IPSP is sufficiently brief so that the disynaptic EPSP is blocked at presumed intrasomatic recording sites unless these experimental manipulations are carried out. In all histologically verified pyramidal cells in both layers II and III in which the appropriate tests were carried out, both mono- and disynaptic EPSP components were present. It was concluded on the basis of anatomical considerations, however, that a small number of pyramidal cells would be expected to receive only a disynaptic EPSP. Evidence that the LOT-evoked disynaptic EPSP is mediated, at least in part, by association axons was provided by direct stimulation of these fibers in layer III and by demonstrating that the EPSP is present distal to cuts that sever LOT axons. Direct stimulation of association axons in layer III evokes both a monosynaptic EPSP and a disynaptic IPSP in pyramidal cells at similar latencies. This IPSP is indistinguishable in properties from that evoked by LOT stimulation. Indirect evidence indicates that it is mediated via both feedforward and feedback mechanisms. In most neurons the association fiber-evoked EPSP is masked by the IPSP in response to single deep shocks but can be demonstrated by blocking the IPSP with a preceding LOT shock or by application of bicuculline.

The central latencies of the fast IPSPs (measured from the onset of the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) elicited by volleys through the LOT) ranged between 3.0 and 9.3 ms (5.5 +/- 1.3 (SD) ms; n = 54) in the case of OB shocks and between 4.5 and 6.5 ms (5.1 +/- 0.7 (SD) ms; n = 7) in the case of LOT shocks.

Thus, the onset latency of the OB-evoked fast IPSP was lengthened by 7.1 +/- 2.9 (SD) ms (n = 35) by the conditioning OB shock. The conditioning OB or DPC shocks left the peak amplitude of the DPC-evoked fast IPSP almost unaffected. Similarly, the conditioning OB or AC shocks left the peak amplitude of the AC-evoked fast IPSP almost unaffected. The conditioning OB, DPC, or AC shocks had only a slight influence on the onset latency of the DPC- or AC-evoked fast IPSPs. Rhythmical steps at intervals of 3-5 ms were observed in the rising phase of the OB-evoked fast IPSP. This was interpreted as a result of a repetitive impingement of interneuronal discharges on the impaled cells. Spatial facilitation was observed among the fast IPSPs evoked by volleys from the OB, DPC, and AC when shocks were applied at suitable intervals. A slight facilitation was also seen between the LOT-evoked fast IPSP and the DPC- or AC-evoked fast IPSP. These results were interpreted as a result of the convergence of excitatory synaptic inputs onto the presumed inhibitory interneurons from the four structures of the brain. A temporal facilitation of the fast IPSPs was observed when the OB, DPC, or AC shocks were applied repetitively at short intervals.

Convergent (or nociceptive non-specific) neurons could often be inhibited from body parts not included in their excitatory receptive field. Some neurons driven by noxious stimulation were able to encode stimulus parameters such as temperature of a hot water bath or surface of the skin area stimulated.

For comparison of thus created electrophysiological atlas with anatomical atlas display was made on various sections of the Schaltenbrand and Bailey's Atlas which were also stored in the mimifloppy disc system. Electrophysiological topography of the thalamus and adjacent structures was reasonably similar to anatomical topography with minor, but significant individual variations. In most cases the ventral border of the thalamus was located in the close vicinity of CA-CP line, however, in some cases the thalamus was located deep into the subthalamic field. This was thought to be due to the difficulty in identifying the ventral border of the thalamus by this technique and in such occasions other neurophysiological method for identifying the ventral border of the thalamus, i.e., thalamocortical evoked potential and other stimulation technique, were necessary. Medial aspect of the V. im. nucleus emitted neural noise of different characteristics which in current program was recognized as the subthalamic field. This implies that the medial and lateral aspects of the V. im. nucleus are cytoarchitecturally different and that it is possible to differentiate the medial and lateral aspects of the V. im. nucleus by this technique. The lateral thalamic border, i.e., thalamocapsular border, also showed relatively wide range of individual variations.

The effects of the neuropathy on muscle and motor end-plate morphology, and on neuromuscular transmission in slow-twitch (soleus) and fast-twitch (extensor digitorum longus) muscle are reported. After forming normally, motor end-plates developed ultraterminal sprouts by about 18 days of age in deep, slow-twitch muscles. The only ultrastructural abnormality in muscle at this age was disruption of Z-lines. Ultraterminal sprouting progressed, and by about 3 months the innervation zone consisted of a mass of branching axons associated in places with cholinesterase activity. The ultrastructure of end-plates became abnormal. Fascicular atrophy was present in older Tremblers and the ultrastructural morphology of muscle fibres became disorganized with accumulation of subsarcolemmal granular material. Abnormal muscle fibres were innervated by axonal sprouts. The superficial, predominantly fast-twitch, muscles showed milder changes at all ages even though the nerves supplying them were hypomyelinated. Studies of neuromuscular transmission showed that soleus retained its slow-twitch and extensor digitorum longus its fast-twitch characteristics, and miniature end-plate potentials were of normal frequency and amplitude. The latency of end-plate potentials and the refractory period of transmission were prolonged in both soleus and extensor digitorum longus. With repetitive stimulation at 50 Hz a cyclical pattern of responses and failures occurred which was probably caused by intermittent conduction block along the peripheral nerve. Although the pathological changes in Trembler muscle were like those of partial denervation, atrophic muscles contained an abundance of axons and there was no evidence of axonal degeneration. The changes in muscle are therefore a consequence of hypomyelination without axonal loss. Since slow-twitch muscles are normally subjected to prolonged stimulation, failure of Trembler axons to conduct sustained trains of stimuli in vivo may contribute to the development of pathological changes in slow-twitch muscle. Hypomyelimated axons may be capable of conducting short bursts of impulses, however, which is the pattern of stimulation in fast-twitch muscle in vivo, so that fast-twitch muscle fibres and end-plates remain relatively spared.", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "[Deep stimulation of the brain].", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "6853762", "authors": ["Broggi, G"], "year": "", "journal": "Rivista di neurobiologia : organo ufficiale della Societ\u00e0 dei neurologi, neuroradiologi e neurochirurghi ospedalieri", "abstract": "Midbrain single units in anesthetized female hamsters were examined for pronounced, sustained responses to types of somatic stimuli which control the display of lordosis during periods of sexual receptivity.

Many of the FH, RE and LHA neurons were excited by nociceptive stimulation such as pinching the skin with serrated forceps and/or intra-arterial injection of bradykinin. These nociceptive neurons were also excited by non-nociceptive stimulation such as tap of deep tissues, bending hairs with an air-puff and/or joint rotation. On the other hand, inhibition by both nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimuli was seen in and around the rostral end of the FH including STRF. Their receptive fields were large. After intravenous administration of either morphine or pentazocine, most nociceptive neurons became unresponsive to nociceptive stimuli, although they were driven by non-nociceptive stimuli.

The cells were in either the cervical or the lumbar enlargement, and they were identified by antidromic activation from the medial part of the pontomedullary reticular formation. More spinoreticular neurons were sampled in the cervical than in the lumbar cord. Most of the cells were contralateral to the side from which antidromic activation was observed, but a higher proportion of the spinoreticular neurons in the cervical enlargement than in the lumbar enlargement was ipsilateral to the antidromic stimulus. Three cells in the lumbar cord were antidromically activated not only from the reticular formation but also from the contralateral thalamus, confirming that some spinoreticular projections are formed by collaterals from spinothalamic cells. Most of the spinoreticular neurons were in the ventral horn in laminae VII and VIII, although a few were in laminae IV-VI. Nearly half of the spinoreticular cells in the sample could not be activated by any form of peripheral stimulation tested. The other cells could be activated by stimulation of receptive fields that varied from small to large, that were sometimes bilateral regions of the skin or deep tissues. Although some spinoreticular cells could be classified as low threshold or wide dynamic range, the largest proportion were high threshold, requiring noxious stimulation for their activation. Descending volleys resulting from stimulation in the reticular formation could often be shown to inhibit or to excite spinoreticular neurons. It can be concluded that at least some spinoreticular neurons may play a role in nociception.", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "105", "title": "Changes produced by a hypomyelinating neuropathy in muscle and its innervation.

A lumped-circuit model is proposed for the local interactions within the hippocampal CAl region. Each neuronal population is represented by a linear differential equation or a linear transfer function in the Laplace domain. Interactions between neuronal populations are represented by gain factors. Recurrent inhibition of pyramidal cells by the inhibitory interneurons is the important interaction represented by an asymmetric, bidirectionally saturating gain curve. The inputs to the model are orthodromic or antidromic inputs to the pyramidal cells and a tonic input from the brain stem. The outputs are the response ot pyramidal cells and interneurons. 2. The model is evaluated by data of intracellular and extracellular recordings from the hippocampus. Extracellular recordings consist of the average evoked potentials (AEPs), unitary poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs), and the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG). On account of the regular structure of the hippocampus, extracellular potentials are expected to correspond to the average intracellular potential among a local neuronal population. 3. Under deep anesthesia, all neuronal responses evoked by an electrical shock to the hippocampal afferents end in a prolonged inhibition of pyramidal cells. The model further predicts that the duration of inhibition increases with stimulus intensity, which is verified experimentally. 4. In the awake rat, especially during behaviors accompanied by a hippocampal theta rhythm (e.g., walking), the AEPs evoked by stimulation of afferent input to the CAl region were oscillatory with a frequency of 20-50 cycles/s. In the model an excitatory bias from the brain stem is assumed to linearize the local circuits, resulting in oscillatory responses similar to those obtained experimentally. 5. As observed by spectral analysis, the hippocampal EEG of the frequency 40-70 Hz varied in power and resonance during various behaviors of the rat. Except for the theta rhythm, analysis of the output(s) of the model given a Gaussian white-noise input showed similar power spectra as the EEG in vivo. The increase in power of the 40-70 Hz EEG in some behaviors, e.g., walking, is reproduced by assuming that during such behaviors a modulating bias from the brain stem linearizes the local CAl circuits. This latter circumstances underlies the generation of oscillatory AEPs and the high-frequency EEG. 6. When recurrent excitatory-inhibitory feedback is very large, the model produces a limit cycle of 50-65 cycles/s. The limit cycle is suggested to be the cause of a particular type of high-frequency (50-65 cycles/s) hippocampal afterdischarge that occurs after tetanization of the input pathways. The amplitude, frequency, and waveform of the model generated and experimental data are similar. 7. In conclusion, a nonlinear recurrent excitatory-inhibitory feedback model of the hippocampus explains and integrates various existing experimental data. The model further predicts results that can be experimentally tested.", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "240", "title": "Midbrain distribution of neurons with strong, sustained responses to lordosis trigger stimuli in the female golden hamster.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "6824931", "authors": ["Rose, JD"], "year": "1982", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The effects of ischemia and recovery from ischemia on afferent discharges recorded from dorsal root filaments were assessed in anesthesized cats.

Baclofen appears to reduce the excitatory input to the GABA-utilizing inhibitory interneurones; this action was manifest as a drug-induced abolition of the field potential known as the P-wave (IC50 for (-)-baclofen, 1.7 +/- 0.4 microM) together with a simultaneous reduction in the synaptically evoked release of aspartase and glutamate from the cut surface of slices. Both these actions of baclofen exhibited concentration dependence and stereospecificity and were not antagonized by picrotoxin (25 microM) thereby suggesting that they are directly related. The consequence of this action of baclofen was the abolition of GABA-mediated presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition together with their respective field potential correlates, the late N- and I-waves. (+/-)-Baclofen (5 and 25 microM) also inhibited the potassium-evoked release of aspartate and glutamate from small cubes of tissue but, except at a high concentration (1 mM), had no effect on GABA release. Baclofen (up to 1 mM) did not affect transmission either at the lateral olfactory tract-superficial pyramidal cell synapse, a site where aspartate is the likely neurotransmitter, or at the superficial pyramidal cell collateral-deep pyramidal cell excitatory synapse. It is proposed that: (i) the actions of baclofen on the olfactory cortex are the result of inhibition of aspartate and glutamate release, probably from deep pyramidal cell collaterals; and (ii) not all neurones utilizing excitatory amino acids as their neurotransmitters are subject to the inhibitory action of baclofen.", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "137", "title": "Nociceptive and non-nociceptive responses of neurons in the medial subthalamic region and lateral hypothalamic area of cats and their relationship to the effects of morphine and pentazocine.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "6848110", "authors": ["Miyakawa, H", "Okuda, K", "Shima, K", "Aya, K", "Nakahama, H"], "year": "1982", "journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "abstract": "The somatotopic organization of somatosensory (SI) cortical projections to the deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) in rats was examined using neurophysiological micromapping methods.

Neurons were recorded in cortical areas 1, 2, and 3a. Consideration was given to both suprathreshold and subthreshold inputs evoked by electrical stimulation of forelimb nerves. Individual cortico-cortical neurons and also pyramidal tract neurons were characterized by convergence of multiple somatosensory inputs from different regions of skin, from several muscle groups, and between group I deep afferents and low threshold cutaneous afferents. Certain patterns of afferent input varied with cytoarchitectonic area. There was, however, no difference between area 3a and areas 1-2 in the incidence of cross-modality convergence in the form of input from cutaneous and also deep nerves. Many of the inputs were subthreshold. Arguments are presented that these inputs, though subthreshold, must be considered for a role in cortical information processing. The convergent nature of the sensory inputs is discussed in relation to the proposed specificities of cortical columns. The patterns of afferent inputs reaching cortico-cortical neurons seem to be appropriate for them to have a role in the formation of sensory fields of motor cortex neurons. PT neurons of somatosensory cortex have possible roles as modifiers of ascending sensory systems, however, the convergent input which these PT neurons receive argues against a simple relationship between the modality of peripheral stimuli influencing them and the modality of the ascending tract neurons under their descending control.", "pages": "440-2"}, {"volume": "238", "title": "Baclofen: effects on evoked field potentials and amino acid neurotransmitter release in the rat olfactory cortex slice.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "6300704", "authors": ["Collins, GG", "Anson, J", "Kelly, EP"], "year": "1982", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "A method is suggested of quantitative evaluation of disorders of musculoarticular sensitivity from the time of ordinary motor reaction to passive movement of a finger (BR).

Immediate responses were significantly more probable than delayed responses. The other observed parameters of the response (plasma progesterone and diestrus length) were not related to stimulus magnitude. The probabilities of immediate or delayed responses were related to rod penetration by power functions, implying an exponential transformation of the received stimulus. An exponential transformation of rod penetration into pressure on the cervix, which occurs at the vaginal level, seems not to contribute substantially to the final exponential transformation. The relationship between stimulus duration and response probability could not be defined mathematically. No further increase in probability of response was caused by prolonging a deep penetration (24 mm) beyond 5 s (immediate responses) and 15 s (delayed responses).
