In this article, the authors review the development of DBS for OCD, describe the current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disorder and how the underlying neural circuits might be modulated by DBS, and discuss the clinical studies that provide evidence for the use of this evolving therapy.

Movement disorders are well-established indications for DBS, and a number of other neurological and psychiatric indications are currently being investigated. Numerous contemporary opinions, reviews, and viewpoints on DBS fail to provide a comprehensive account of how this method came into being. Misconceptions in the narrative history of DBS conveyed by the wealth of literature published over the last 2 decades can be summarized as follows: Deep brain stimulation was invented in 1987. The utility of high-frequency stimulation was also discovered in 1987. Lesional surgery preceded DBS. Deep brain stimulation was first used in the treatment of movement disorders and was subsequently used in the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral disorders. Reports of nonmotor effects of subthalamic nucleus DBS prompted its use in psychiatric illness. Early surgical interventions for psychiatric illness failed to adopt a multidisciplinary approach; neurosurgeons often worked \"in isolation\" from other medical specialists. The involvement of neuro-ethicists and multidisciplinary teams are novel standards introduced in the modern practice of DBS for mental illness that are essential in avoiding the unethical behavior of bygone eras. In this paper, the authors examined each of these messages in the light of literature published since 1947 and formed the following conclusions. Chronic stimulation of subcortical structures was first used in the early 1950s, very soon after the introduction of human stereotaxy. Studies and debate on the stimulation frequency most likely to achieve desirable results and avoid side effects date back to the early days of DBS; several authors advocated the use of \"high\" frequency, although the exact frequency was not always specified. Ablative surgery and electrical stimulation developed in parallel, practically since the introduction of human stereotactic surgery. The first applications of both ablative surgery and chronic subcortical stimulation were in psychiatry, not in movement disorders. The renaissance of DBS in surgical treatment of psychiatric illness in 1999 had little to do with nonmotor effects of subthalamic nucleus DBS but involved high-frequency stimulation of the very same brain targets previously used in ablative surgery. Pioneers in functional neurosurgery mostly worked in multidisciplinary groups, including when treating psychiatric illness; those \"acting in isolation\" were not neurosurgeons. Ethical concerns have indeed been addressed in the past, by neurosurgeons and others. Some of the questionable behavior in surgery for psychiatric illness, including the bygone era of DBS, was at the hands of nonneurosurgeons. These practices have been deemed as \"dubious and precarious by yesterday's standards.\"", "pages": "E10"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "[Deep brain stimulation--the newest physical method of treatment of depression].", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20672511", "authors": ["Zyss, T", "Zieba, A", "Hese, RT", "Dudek, D", "Grabski, B"], "year": "", "journal": "Psychiatria polska", "abstract": "The deep brain stimulation DBS is the newest physical method of the treatment of depressive disorders.

We recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) from median nerve stimulation through deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the PPNR in 8 patients (6 with Parkinson's disease, 2 with progressive supranuclear palsy). Monopolar recordings from the PPNR contacts showed triphasic or biphasic potentials. The latency of the largest negative peak was between 16.8 and 18.7 milliseconds.

However, there is a fraction of patients who experience limited relief from pharmaceuticals or experience bothersome side-effects of the drugs. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and surgical lesioning of the thalamus and basal ganglia are respected neurosurgical procedures, with valued success rates and a very low incidence of complications. Despite these positive outcomes, DBS and surgical lesioning procedures are contraindicated for some patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with the Gamma Knife (GK) has been used as a lesioning technique for patients seeking a non-invasive treatment alternative and for medication-intolerable patients, who are unable to undergo DBS or lesioning due to comorbid medical conditions. Tremors of various etiologies are treated using GK thalamotomy, which targets the ventralis intermedius nucleus. GK thalamotomy produces favorable outcomes when treating tremors, with success rates ranging from 80-100%. In contrast, GK pallidotomy targets the internal globus pallidus, and is used in treating bradykinesia, rigidity, and dyskinesia. Although radiosurgery has proven beneficial for tremors, radiosurgical pallidotomy for bradykinesia, rigidity, and dyskinesia remains questionable, with mixed success rates in the literature that ranges from 0-87%. We suggest that GK thalamotomy be offered along with other neurosurgical approaches as a feasible treatment option to patients who prefer the non-invasive nature of radiosurgery and to those who are unqualified candidates for the neurosurgical alternatives.

Pf-HFS had significant anti-akinetic action, evidenced by alleviation of limb use asymmetry (cylinder test). Whereas this anti-akinetic action was moderate, Pf-HFS totally reversed lateralized neglect (corridor task), suggesting potent action on sensorimotor integration. At the cellular level, Pf-HFS partially reversed the dopamine denervation-induced increase in striatal preproenkephalin A mRNA levels, a marker of the neurons of the indirect pathway, without interfering with the markers of the direct pathway (preprotachykinin and preprodynorphin). Pf-HFS totally reversed the lesion-induced changes in the gene expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit I in the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and partially in the entopeduncular nucleus. Unlike HFS of the subthalamic nucleus, Pf-HFS did not induce per se dyskinesias and directly, although partially, alleviated L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced forelimb dyskinesia. Conversely, L-DOPA treatment negatively interfered with the anti-parkinsonian effect of Pf-HFS. Altogether, these data show that Pf-DBS, by recruiting a large basal ganglia circuitry, provides moderate to strong anti-parkinsonian benefits that might, however, be affected by L-DOPA.

Fundamental understanding of individual patient's anatomy is critical for optimizing the effects and side effects of DBS surgery. Three patients undergoing stereotactic surgery for movement disorders, at the institution's intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging operating suite, were studied with fiber tractography. Stereotactic targets and fiber tractography were determined on preoperative magnetic resonance imagings using the Schaltenbrand-Wahren atlas for definition in the BrainLab iPlan software (BrainLAB Inc., Feldkirchen, Germany). Subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus interna, and ventral intermediate nucleus targets were studied. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters used ranged from 2 to 8 mm for volume of interest in the x/y/z planes, fiber length was kept constant at 30 mm, and fractional anisotropy threshold varied from 0.20 to 0.45. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography allowed reliable and reproducible visualization and correlation between frontal eye field, premotor, primary motor, and primary sensory cortices via corticospinal tracts and corticopontocerebellar tracts. There is an apparent increase in the number of cortical regions targeted by the fiber tracts as the region of interest is enlarged. This represents a possible mechanism of the increased effects and side effects observed with higher stimulation voltages. Currently available diffusion tensor imaging techniques allow potential methods to characterize the effects and side effects of DBS.

The mechanism of action of DBS is largely unclear. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies on DBS patients have been unfeasible because of strong magnetic artifacts. An artifact suppression method known as spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) has mainly overcome these difficulties. We wanted to clarify whether tSSS enables noninvasive measurement of the modulation of cortical activity caused by DBS. We have studied auditory and somatosensory-evoked fields (AEFs and SEFs) of advanced PD patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS using MEG. AEFs were elicited by 1-kHz tones and SEFs by electrical pulses to the median nerve with DBS on and off. Data could be successfully acquired and analyzed from 12 out of 16 measured patients. The motor symptoms were significantly relieved by DBS, which clearly enhanced the ipsilateral auditory N100m responses in the right hemisphere. Contralateral N100m responses and somatosensory P60m responses also had a tendency to increase when bilateral DBS was on. MEG with tSSS offers a novel and powerful tool to investigate DBS modulation of the evoked cortical activity in PD with high temporal and spatial resolution.

However, the mechanisms by which it works, remain unclear. In a previous study, we showed that locally delivered single current pulses delivered from a nearby microelectrode are sufficient to inhibit firing in the internal globus pallidus for tens of milliseconds. The GPi and the substantia nigra pars reticulata are the output nuclei of the basal ganglia and share many anatomical and physiological features. The goal of the current study was to examine the after-effects of trains of high-frequency microstimulation on neuronal firing in the GPi of Parkinson's disease and dystonia patients as well as in the SNr of PD patients. Microelectrode recordings and microstimulation were performed in a total of 57 patients during stereotactic surgery. We found that firing in the GPi and SNr is inhibited for several hundreds of milliseconds following the end of a short, 200 Hz high-frequency train delivered through the recording electrode (e.g., on average 618 ms when stimulating in the SNr with a 0.5 s train of 4 microA pulses at 200 Hz). Inhibition duration usually increased with increasing current intensity, train frequency and generally peaked for trains of 1-2 s, while it decreased with increasing train durations. Statistical analysis with general linear models revealed a significant linear relationship between current intensity and inhibition duration in all nuclei and patient groups. There was also a significant relationship between train frequency and inhibition duration in the SNr and GPi of PD patients and between train duration and inhibition duration in the GPi of PD patients. There was no significant difference in inhibition duration across patient groups but the current threshold for inhibition was significantly different in the SNr compared to the GPi. The characteristics of the inhibition observed are consistent with stimulation-induced GABA release following activation of the GABAergic afferents in the SNr and GPi. The findings suggest that high-frequency microstimulation of the GPi and SNr depresses local neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, and such mechanisms may contribute to the therapeutic effects of DBS.", "pages": "E10"}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Neuromodulation approaches for the treatment of major depression: challenges and recommendations from a working group meeting.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "4715298", "authors": ["Brunoni, AR", "Teng, CT", "Correa, C", "Imamura, M", "Brasil-Neto, JP", "Boechat, R", "Rosa, M", "Caramelli, P", "Cohen, R", "Del Porto, JA", "Boggio, PS", "Fregni, F"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria", "abstract": "Camptocormia (bent spine syndrome, cyphose hyst\u00e9rique) is an abnormality characterized by severe forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine which typically increases during walking or standing and completely disappears in supine position.

In such cases, motor cortex stimulation is among the neurostimulation techniques available for its symptomatic control. This technique is based on surgical implantation of electrodes over the motor cortical representation of the painful area. Image-guided navigation is used for precise identification of the motor cortex intraoperatively, but proper placement of the electrodes is usually ensured by electrophysiologic mapping. This article details the intraoperative electrophysiologic procedure that we currently use for refining electrode placement in the epidural space, including the recording of somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Various procedures have been reported and some groups are using direct cortical mapping and subdural electrode placement rather than epidural. Our method is one of several proposed techniques and is mostly based on intraoperative MEP mapping in response to monopolar (anodal) epidural stimulation of the cortex. The limit of this approach is that MEPs cannot be recorded in patients with total or severe motor deficit. We have shown that intraoperative mapping of the cortical region corresponding to the painful area by recording MEPs could help select contacts to be activated for chronic stimulation. Therefore, the patients in whom intraoperative MEP mapping is possible could benefit from this technique, at least if we consider that it improves the accuracy of electrode placement and that motor cortex stimulation efficacy critically depends on this placement.", "pages": "E10"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Risk factors for executive dysfunction after subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "7951687", "authors": ["Daniels, C", "Krack, P", "Volkmann, J", "Pinsker, MO", "Krause, M", "Tronnier, V", "Kloss, M", "Schnitzler, A", "Wojtecki, L", "B\u00f6tzel, K", "Danek, A", "Hilker, R", "Sturm, V", "Kupsch, A", "Karner, E", "Deuschl, G", "Witt, K"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Many nervous system disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, mood disorders) involve neurotransmitters as well as electrical activity. Pharmacologic treatment does not target the precise location(s) where neurotransmitter imbalances occur. Additionally, non-neuronal cells in the brain--notably astrocytes--influence neuronal activity through both electrical and neurochemical modulation of nearby neurons. Precise monitoring/recording and modulating/stimulating (both electrical and neurochemical) can optimize therapy in specific disorders and specific patients. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes (5 microm diameter) in freely moving rodents have shown that dopamine release is heterogeneous within various regions in the nucleus accumbens, a region involved in many mood disorders. Because neurons are only several microns in diameter (axons, dendrites, and synaptic clefts smaller still), ultramicroelectrodes will be essential to selectively monitor/modulate the cell body, the axon, or at the intracellular level. Nanoelectrode arrays can monitor both electrical activity and dopamine in real time with submicron resolution, and stimulate neurons with equal precision. Computational models indicate that precise monitoring/modulating (electrically and neurochemically) at the subnucleus or neuron level will be necessary to restore normal firing patterns and neurotransmitter levels in many brain disorders. Endovascular techniques can introduce ultramicroelectrodes (0.5 micron or smaller) into the brain via capillaries; such electrodes can stimulate/record neuronal tissue with a response virtually identical to extra-vascular microelectrodes. Within the next decade, hundreds if not thousands of submicron-sized monitoring/modulating electrodes can be placed wherever needed to restore brain function to normal.

Two main themes will advance DBS significantly in the next five years: closed-loop DBS, that is, feedback from brain electrical activity to direct the stimulation; and computational analysis (CA)--electrophysiological modeling to enhance DBS. Closed-loop DBS is currently in clinical trials for refractory epilepsy. New imaging techniques offer preoperative modeling for DBS surgery, including nerve fiber tracts (diffusion tensor imaging), and imaging of volume of tissue activated by a specific electrode. CA techniques for DBS include mathematical models of the abnormally synchronized electrical activity which underlies epilepsy, movement disorders, and likely many mood disorders as well. By incorporating feedback loops and multiple recording and/or stimulating sites, the abnormally synchronized brain electrical activity can be desynchronized, then \"unlearned\" (\"unkindling\" in epilepsy). Characteristics of DBS utilizing CA include low frequency rather than high frequency stimulation; multiple stimulation and/or recording sites; likely 10-fold or more reduction in electrical current needs (much smaller \"pulse generators\"); more focused and less disruptive stimulation--fewer unwanted side effects; and potential to \"cure\" certain disorders by resetting abnormal firing patterns back to normal. These advantages of more sophisticated DBS techniques bring the following challenges, which may require a decade of research before reaching clinical practice because many brain disorders involve neurotransmitter abnormalities (e.g., dopamine in Parkinson's disease and certain mood disorders).

Pharmaceutical therapies altogether fail to address an estimated 4 million Americans who suffer from a recurrent and severe treatment-resistant form of depression known as refractory major depressive disorder.

Stimulation-based therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation, are promising treatment alternatives for this treatment-resistant subset of patients, but are plagued with inconsistent reports of efficacy and variable side effects. Many of these problems stem from the unknown mechanisms of depressive disorder pathogenesis, which prevents the development of treatments that target the specific underlying causes of the disorder. Other problems likely arise due to the non-specific stimulation of various limbic and paralimbic structures in an open-loop configuration.

Two of the six presented with adult-onset levodopa (L-dopa)-responsive asymmetric re-emergent rest tremor, developing L-dopa-induced dyskinesias, and good benefit to deep brain stimulation (in one), thus resembling Parkinson's disease (PD). Both had an eye-of-the-tiger sign on MRI but were negative for known NBIA-associated genes, suggesting the existence of further genetic or sporadic forms of NBIA syndromes. In conclusion, genetically determined NBIA cases from the Indian subcontinent suggest presence of unusual phenotypes of PANK2 and novel mutations.

Predictors of outcome are the experience and dedication of the stereotactic team, the selection of patients--the diagnosis and pre-operative screening--and the quality of the post-operative care.

Whilst selective peripheral denervation is reserved for cervical dystonia refractory to botulinum toxin injections, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the pallidum has gained a wide scope and presents an elementary column in the treatment of medically refractory patients, nowadays. There is consensus that idiopathic generalized, cervical and segmental dystonia are good indications for DBS, although there is still a paucity of studies providing high-level data according to EBM criteria. Efficacy is maintained on longterm. Several other forms of primary dystonia are still under investigation but it appears that patients with Meige syndrome and myoclonus-dystonia gain also marked benefit. Study of the outcome in secondary dystonia disorders is more complex, in general, but patients with tardive dystonia gain similar improvement than patients with idiopathic dystonia. Overall, the risk profile of pallidal DBS is quite low, and it has been shown to be cognitively safe. The effect of pallidal DBS on non-dystonic extremities has not received much attention, albeit there are hints for a pro-akinetic mechanism.

However, dystonia is still one of the most important indications for BT therapy. BT drugs consist of botulinum neurotoxin, complexing proteins and excipients. Botox, Dysport and Xeomin are BT type A drugs and produce similar therapeutic and adverse effects (AE). Neurobloc/MyoBloc is based upon BT type B. Its use is limited by substantial systemic anticholinergic AE. The potency of BT drugs may be compared as follows: Botox:Xeomin:Dysport:Neuobloc/MyoBloc = 1:1:3:40. BT selectively blocks the cholinergic innervation of striate and smooth muscles and exocrine glands. It can produce obligate, local and systemic AE. However, its overall AE profile including long-term safety is excellent. BT can be blocked by antibodies. Risk factors include single doses, interinjection intervals and the immunological quality of the BT drug applied. Planning of BT therapy is based upon target muscle identification and estimation of their dystonic involvement. For planning of BT therapy and BT placement, electromyography and imaging techniques may be used additionally. So far, total Xeomin and Botox doses of up to 840 MU have been used without clinically detectable systemic AE. BT can be used to treat focal dystonias including cranial, pharyngolaryngeal, cervical and limb dystonias. In segmental and generalized dystonias, BT therapy has to be focussed on the most relevant target muscles. Combinations with all other treatment options including deep brain stimulation are possible. Recent safety data and availability of immunologically improved BT drugs are now allowing higher BT doses thus expanding the use of BT into more widespread dystonias.", "pages": "E10"}, {"volume": "480", "title": "The different performance among motor tasks during the increasing current intensity of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in rats with different degrees of the unilateral striatal lesion.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18164481", "authors": ["Fang, X", "Sugiyama, K", "Akamine, S", "Sun, W", "Namba, H"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system (DA) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Despite promising case reports, no consensus exists as yet regarding optimal stimulation parameters or neuroanatomical target for DBS in TD. Here we report the use of DBS in an animal model of TD. We applied DBS (100 \u03bcA) acutely to the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) or subthalamic nucleus (STN) in rats with well established vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) induced by 12 weeks of haloperidol (HAL) treatment. Stimulation of the STN or EPN resulted in significant reductions in VCM counts at frequencies of 30, 60 or 130 Hz. In the STN DBS groups, effects were significantly more pronounced at 130 Hz than at lower frequencies, whereas at the EPN the three frequencies were equipotent. Unilateral stimulation at 130 Hz was also effective when applied to either nucleus. These results suggest that stimulation of either the EPN or STN significantly alleviates oral dyskinesias induced by chronic HAL. The chronic HAL VCM model preparation may be useful to explore mechanisms underlying DBS effects in drug-induced dyskinesias.", "pages": "E10"}, {"volume": "82", "title": "MRI-guided STN DBS in Parkinson's disease without microelectrode recording: efficacy and safety.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "20658301", "authors": ["Foltynie, T", "Zrinzo, L", "Martinez-Torres, I", "Tripoliti, E", "Petersen, E", "Holl, E", "Aviles-Olmos, I", "Jahanshahi, M", "Hariz, M", "Limousin, P"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical treatment, which has proven useful in treating Parkinson's disease.
