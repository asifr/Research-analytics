In this review, we examine whether STN and PPN act synergistically or antagonistically. Results suggest that the combination of STN and PPN stimulations leads to a significant further improvement in gait as compared with STN stimulation alone, but additive effects on the classical motor triad are questionable. Thus, they highlight the specificity of STN stimulation over PPN's for the PD cardinal features and the specificity of PPN stimulation over STN for gait disorders. In addition, low-frequency stimulation of the PPN may improve alertness. The additive rather than potentiating effects of STN and PPN stimulations suggest that they may be mediated by distinct pathways.

This is particularly exemplified by high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-HFS), which has emerged as an efficient symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease. How STN-HFS works is still not fully elucidated. With dual patch-clamp recordings in rat brain slices, we analysed the cellular responses of STN stimulation on SNr neurons by simultaneously recording synaptic currents and firing activity. We showed that STN-HFS caused an increase of the spontaneous spiking activity in half of SNr neurons while the remaining ones displayed a decrease. At the synaptic level, STN stimulation triggered inward current in 58% of whole-cell recorded neurons and outward current in the remaining ones. Using a pharmacological approach, we showed that STN-HFS-evoked responses were mediated in all neurons by a balance between AMPA/NMDA receptors and GABA(A) receptors, whose ratio promotes either a net excitation or a net inhibition. Interestingly, we observed a higher excitation occurrence in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats. In vivo injections of phaseolus revealed that GABAergic pallido-nigral fibres travel through the STN whereas striato-nigral fibres travel below it. Therefore, electrical stimulation of the STN does not only recruit glutamatergic axons from the STN, but also GABAergic passing fibres probably from the globus pallidus. For the first time, we showed that STN-HFS induces concomitant excitatory-inhibitory synaptic currents in SNr neurons by recruitment of efferences and passing fibres allowing a tight control on basal ganglia outflow.", "pages": "S54-62"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Informed consent for clinical trials of deep brain stimulation in psychiatric disease: challenges and implications for trial design.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16521122", "authors": ["Lipsman, N", "Giacobbe, P", "Bernstein, M", "Lozano, AM"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of medical ethics", "abstract": "Experimental and clinical data suggest that high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of different subcortical structures can be used to control or modulate epileptic seizures.

The aim of this study was to determine whether DBS of SNr could also suppress tonic epileptic seizures evoked in hindbrain structures. DBS with high frequency often mimics the effects of surgical ablation of a particular area of the brain. However, the optimal parameters of DBS stimulation to induce ablation-like effects on seizures are not well defined. Consequently, in the first experiment we examined the effects of different stimulation frequencies (80, 130, 260 and 390 Hz) on neuronal activation induced in SNr, using c-fos immunocytochemistry. The results showed that the stimulation of the SNr with 80 Hz has no inhibitory effect while stimulation with 130, 260 and 390 Hz produced a remarkable suppressive effect compared with the control unstimulated side. The aim of the second experiment was to determine whether bilateral inhibition of SNr with DBS could suppress tonic seizures induced by electric shock. Statistical analysis showed that the mean tonic seizure scores following SNr stimulation with either 130 or 260 Hz were not significantly different from scores following the application of the electrode without current. The data suggest that DBS of the SNr produces neuronal inhibition but fails to suppress tonic seizures. We conclude, therefore, that DBS of SNr with frequencies used in this study might not be effective for treatment of patients who suffer from tonic epileptic seizures.", "pages": "S54-62"}, {"volume": "310", "title": "Impulsivity and Parkinson's disease: more than just disinhibition.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "11188968", "authors": ["Antonelli, F", "Ray, N", "Strafella, AP"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "abstract": "Advances in neuromodulation and an improved understanding of the anatomy and circuitry of psychopathology have led to a resurgence of interest in surgery for psychiatric disease.

Psychiatric patients deemed eligible for surgical intervention, such as DBS, typically meet stringent inclusion criteria, including demonstrated severity, chronicity and a failure of conventional therapy. Although a humanitarian device exemption by the US Food and Drug Administration exists for its use in obsessive-compulsive disorder, DBS remains a largely experimental treatment in the psychiatric context, with its use currently limited to clinical trials and investigative studies.

Nevertheless, several heterogeneous factors, such as clinical phenotype, age at onset and genetic aspects may influence the long-term clinical picture. In order to investigate the main features of long-term Parkinson's disease progression, we studied a cohort of 19 subjects treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation after >20 years of disease, reporting clinical and neuropsychological data up to a mean of 30 years from disease onset. This group of patients was characterized by an early onset of disease, with a mean age of 38.63 years at Parkinson's disease onset, which was significantly lower than in the other long-term subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation follow-up cohorts reported in the literature. All subjects were regularly evaluated by a complete Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a battery of neuropsychological tests and a clinical interview, intended to assess the rate of non-levodopa-responsive symptom progression. Clinical data were available for all patients at presurgical baseline and at 1, 3 and 5 years from the subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation surgical procedure, while follow-up data after >7 years were additionally reported in a subgroup of 14 patients. The clinical and neuropsychological performance progressively worsened during the course of follow-up; 64% of patients gradually developed falls, 86% dysphagia, 57% urinary incontinence and 43% dementia. A progressive worsening of motor symptoms was observed both in 'medication-ON' condition and in 'stimulation-ON' condition, with a parallel reduction in the synergistic effect of 'medication-ON/stimulation-ON' condition. Neuropsychological data also showed a gradual decline in the performances of all main cognitive domains, with an initial involvement of executive functions, followed by the impairment of language, reasoning and memory. Thirty years after the disease onset, most patients presented non-levodopa-responsive symptoms, although the effect of both subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic therapies still showed significant efficacy on the main disease cardinal features. Nevertheless, compared with other subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation follow-up studies, which included patients with a shorter disease duration at the time of surgery, a higher prevalence of axial and non-levodopa-responsive symptoms was observed in the long-term evaluations, confirming that several complex aspects underlie the development of non-motor symptoms and other features of Parkinson's disease progression, even in patients with an early disease onset and a prior long-lasting response to dopaminergic therapies.", "pages": "S54-62"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "A humanitarian device exemption for deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "11287459", "authors": ["Alpert, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Health affairs (Project Hope)", "abstract": "Dystonia is usually a lifelong condition with persistent pain and disability.

However, mechanisms mediating such modulation are unclear. These hypothesized neural pathways are likely to be affected by single electrical stimulus applied through the electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus for deep brain stimulation (sSTNDBS). To improve our knowledge on such mechanisms, we examined in 11 Parkinson's disease patients the effects of conditioning sSTNDBS applied contralateral and ipsilateral to the H reflex recording on the amplitude of the soleus H reflex, at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between 0 and 110 ms. There was a significant main effect of the ISI (P<0.001) and of the sSTNDBS stimulation side (P=0.019) on the percentage change in the soleus H-reflex amplitude. Contralateral sSTNDBS modulation of the soleus H reflex resembles that of TMS in healthy subjects with two facilitation phases (at 5-20 ms and at 60 ms), while after ipsilateral sSTNDBS, there is only a single facilitation phase peaking up at 5 ms later than the first facilitation period observed with contralateral stimulation.

Averaged local field potentials (LFP) to sexually relevant stimuli were characterized by a biphasic significantly enhanced response (relative to objects; bootstrapping statistics) with a first phase starting at around 200 ms and a second phase peaking at around 600 ms. Sexually relevant stimuli also showed a greatly enhanced positivity relative to other stimulus classes in surface event-related potentials in a group of 11 male control participants. It is suggested that the hypothalamus is involved in the recruitment of attentional resources by sexually relevant stimuli reflected in this surface positivity. In a second session, the response to food stimuli relative to objects was tested in two states: after fasting for 14 h, LFPs to food and object stimuli showed significant differences in between 300 and 850 ms, which disappeared after a full high-calorie meal, thus replicating classic studies in monkeys [Rolls et al., Brain Res (1976) 111:53-66].

The highly evolved primate's brain has deep cerebral sulci, and both gyral and intrasulcal cortical regions have been implicated in important functional processes. However, direct experimental access is typically limited to gyral regions, since placing probes into sulci is difficult without damaging the surrounding tissues. Here we describe a novel methodology for intrasulcal ECoG in macaque monkeys. We designed and fabricated ultra-thin flexible probes for macaques with micro-electro-mechanical systems technology. We developed minimally invasive operative protocols to implant the probes by introducing cutting-edge devices for human neurosurgery. To evaluate the feasibility of intrasulcal ECoG, we conducted electrophysiological recording and stimulation experiments. First, we inserted parts of the Parylene-C-based probe into the superior temporal sulcus to compare visually evoked ECoG responses from the ventral bank of the sulcus with those from the surface of the inferior temporal cortex. Analyses of power spectral density and signal-to-noise ratio revealed that the quality of the ECoG signal was comparable inside and outside of the sulcus. Histological examination revealed no obvious physical damage in the implanted areas. Second, we placed a modified silicone ECoG probe into the central sulcus and also on the surface of the precentral gyrus for stimulation. Thresholds for muscle twitching were significantly lower during intrasulcal stimulation compared to gyral stimulation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of intrasulcal ECoG in macaques.

A few dopamine agonists and a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (selegiline) were used as adjuncts in advanced Parkinson's disease. In the early 2010s, levodopa remains the gold standard. New insights into the organization of the basal ganglia paved the way for deep brain stimulation, especially of the subthalamic nucleus, providing spectacular improvement of drug-refractory levodopa-induced motor complications. Novel dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine), catecholmethyltransferase inhibitors (entacapone), and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (rasagiline) have also been developed to provide more continuous oral delivery of dopaminergic stimulation in order to improve motor outcomes. Using dopamine agonists early, before levodopa, proved to delay the onset of dyskinesia, although this is achieved at the price of potentially disabling daytime somnolence or impulse control disorders. The demonstration of an antidyskinetic effect of the glutamate antagonist amantadine opened the door for novel nondopaminergic approaches of Parkinson's disease therapy. More recently, nonmotor symptoms (depression, dementia, and psychosis) have been the focus of the first randomized controlled trials in this field.

In the context of research, the fundamental ethical challenge is to promote high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time safeguarding the rights and interests of vulnerable research subjects. Several guidelines have been proposed to ensure this.

Such EPs have multiple components of different latencies, making it possible to distinguish short-latency and long-latency responses (3-8\u2009ms and 18-25\u2009ms latency, respectively). The available evidence indicates that these short- and long-latency EPs correspond to conduction from the STN stimulation site to the cortical recording location via anti- and orthodromic pathways, respectively.

In both cases, there is a remarkable lack of consensus amongst professionals concerning its operative definition. A relatively wide variety of treatment options for unipolar TRD are available, whilst the evidence is very scanty for bipolar TRD. TRD is associated to poor clinical, functional, and social outcomes. Several novel therapeutic options are currently being investigated as promising alternatives, targeting the neurotransmitter system outside of the standard monoamine hypothesis. Augmentation or combination with lithium or atypical antipsychotics appears as a valid option for both conditions, and the same occurs with electroconvulsive therapy. Other non-pharmacological strategies such as deep brain stimulation may be promising alternatives for the future.

To investigate the mechanism of action of thalamic DBS, we examined the effects of high frequency stimulation (HFS) on spindle oscillations in thalamic brain slices from ferrets. We recorded intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological activity in the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt) and in thalamocortical relay (TC) neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus, stimulated the slice using a concentric bipolar electrode, and recorded the level of glutamate within the slice. HFS (100 Hz) of TC neurons generated excitatory post-synaptic potentials, increased the number of action potentials in both TC and nRt neurons, reduced the input resistance, increased the extracellular glutamate concentration, and abolished spindle wave oscillations. HFS of the nRt also suppressed spindle oscillations. In both locations, HFS was associated with significant and persistent elevation in extracellular glutamate levels and suppressed spindle oscillations for many seconds after the cessation of stimulation. We simulated HFS within a computational model of the thalamic network, and HFS also disrupted spindle wave activity, but the suppression of spindle activity was short-lived. Simulated HFS disrupted spindle activity for prolonged periods of time only after glutamate release and glutamate-mediated activation of a hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) was incorporated into the model. Our results suggest that the mechanism of action of thalamic DBS as used in epilepsy may involve the prolonged release of glutamate, which in turn modulates specific ion channels such as I(h), decreases neuronal input resistance, and abolishes thalamic network oscillatory activity.", "pages": "S54-62"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "Cerebral ischemia related to globus pallidus internus stimulation for cervical dystonia.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "19540864", "authors": ["Kang, DW", "Kim, HY", "Chang, JW"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "Intuitive somatosensory feedback is required for fine motor control.

The goal of this review is to challenge this view, that is, to move to a hodotopical approach to lesion mapping, on the basis of new insights provided by intraoperative electrostimulation mapping investigations in patients who underwent awake surgery for cerebral tumors. These original data reported in the last decade break with the traditional dogma of a modular and fixed organization of the central nervous system, by switching to the concepts of cerebral connectivity and plasticity - i.e., a brain organization based on dynamic interrelationships between parallel distributed networks. According to this revisited model, \"frontal symptoms\" can be generated by tumor or electrostimulation not only of the frontal lobes, but also of cortical and subcortical (white matter pathways/deep gray nuclei) structures outside the frontal lobes: especially, stimulation of the superior longitudinal fascicle may elicit speech production disorders, syntactic disturbances, involuntary language switching or phonemic paraphasia (arcuate fascicle), stimulation of the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle can generate semantic paraphasia or deficit of cross-modal judgment, stimulation of the subcallosal fasciculus may elicit transcortical motor aphasia, while stimulation of the striatum induces preservations. On the other hand, it is also possible to perform extensive right or left frontal lobectomy in patients who continue to have a normal familial, social and professional life, without \"frontal syndrome\". Therefore, this provocative approach may open the door to a renewal in the modeling of brain processing as well as in its clinical applications, especially in the fields of cerebral surgery and functional rehabilitation.

However, our understanding of the mechanism of action of DBS is only minimal. This is largely due to a rudimentary understanding of dystonia pathophysiology itself, which in turn reflects an insufficient understanding of the functional significance of the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamocortical loops. The initial dystonia pathophysiology concept was one of changes in oscillation rate. Soon, it was realized that not only rate but also the pattern of basal ganglia activity is crucial in the etiology of the disease. The observations of altered somatosensory responsiveness and cortical neuroplasticity, along with the vast array of clinical phenotypes, imply the need for a wholistic neuronal pathophysiology model; one in which an underlying defect of basal ganglia function results in increased cortical excitability, misprocessing of sensory feedback, aberrant cortical plasticity, and ultimately clinical dystonia. This unified dystonia pathophysiology model, although simplistic, may provide the scaffold on which all incoming research and clinical data becomes united in a meaningful and practical way. In light of this model, the dramatic response of some forms of dystonia to pallidal stimulation, the time latency for the beneficial effect and even the presence of non-responders may be explained. Additionally, it may help in developing a rationale for more efficacious DBS programming, better selection of the timing of surgery, and more successful identification of those candidates that are most likely to respond to DBS.", "pages": "S54-62"}, {"volume": "188", "title": "Electrical stimulation of the epileptic focus in absence epileptic WAG/Rij rats: assessment of local and network excitability.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17498322", "authors": ["L\u00fcttjohann, A", "Zhang, S", "de Peijper, R", "van Luijtelaar, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a treatment for a growing number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, especially for therapy-refractory Parkinson's disease (PD).
