The NMDA receptor antagonist CPP depresses the rate of occurrence (P < 0.01) of these spontaneous epileptiform discharges but fails in blocking them. Paradoxically, stimulus-induced epileptiform responses are enhanced in duration during CPP application. However, concomitant application of NMDA and non-NMDA glutamatergic antagonists abolishes spontaneous and stimulus-induced epileptiform events. Intracellular recordings from lateral EC layer V cells indicate a lower frequency of spontaneous hyperpolarizing postsynaptic potentials in pilocarpine-treated tissue than in NEC (P < 0.002) both under control conditions and with glutamatergic receptor blockade; the reversal potential of pharmacologically isolated GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials has similar values in the two types of tissue.

A major excitatory output from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the SNR is thought to provide the synaptic impetus for burst firing in SNR neurons. Using patch pipettes to record from SNR neurons in rat brain slices, we found that a single electrical stimulus delivered to the STN evokes a burst of action potentials. Under voltage-clamp conditions, STN stimulation evokes a complex EPSC that is comprised of an initial monosynaptic EPSC followed by a series of late EPSCs superimposed on a long-lasting inward current. Using varied stimulation frequencies, we found that the initial EPSC was significantly reduced or abolished after 2 s of 50-100 Hz STN stimulation. However, only 4 s of 1 Hz stimulation was required to abolish the late component of the complex EPSC.

Here, using whole cell recordings in rat cerebellar slices we demonstrated that after postnatal day 17 (>P17) glycinergic IPSCs can be readily evoked in large deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (DCNs), in the same way as in neonatal DCNs (P7-P10). Spontaneous glycinergic IPSCs were very rare but direct presynaptic depolarization by superfusion with elevated potassium concentration or application of 4-aminopyridine consistently evoked strychnine sensitive IPSCs. Glycinergic IPSCs showed fast kinetics in >P17 DCNs while were significantly slower in neonatal DCNs. Immuno-histochemical investigations using a specific marker for glycinergic fibers and terminals showed low density of immuno-fluorescent puncta, putative glycinergic boutons surrounding P18-P23 DCNs, in agreement with the rare spontaneous synaptic activity. But putative glycinergic boutons were present in critical areas for the control of spike generation. In contrast to adult and neonatal DCNs, glycinergic IPSCs could not be induced in juvenile DCNs (P13-P17) despite similar perisomatic immuno-staining pattern and expression of glycinergic receptors to >P17 DCNs. The latter results demonstrate substantial postnatal development of glycinergic cerebellar nuclei circuits. The cerebellum is involved in rapidly controlling ongoing movements. For that function, it is thought important the temporal and spatial precision of its output, which is carried to target structures by DCNs. The present study, by demonstrating fast glycinergic IPSCs in mature DCNs, points to the activation of glycinergic microcircuits as one of the possible mechanism involved in the spatio-temporal control of cerebellar output.", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Memory enhancement induced by hypothalamic/fornix deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11029534", "authors": ["Hamani, C", "McAndrews, MP", "Cohn, M", "Oh, M", "Zumsteg, D", "Shapiro, CM", "Wennberg, RA", "Lozano, AM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "Headache disorders are common problems in medicine and it is this commonness that often provides an air of the simple or obvious.

Dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease increases basal ganglia output, then decreases thalamocortical output, leading to bradykinesia. This model, however, cannot explain a lack of deterioration of parkinsonian signs following thalamic coagulation surgery. Instead of the rate model, the beta oscillation hypothesis has been proposed, explaining that synchronized oscillation in the beta frequency in the basal ganglia disturbs initiation of voluntary movement. We observed that effective high-frequency STN stimulation in parkinsonian monkeys was associated with increase in the firing rate and the pattern shift from irregular burst firing to regular high-frequency firing in the projecting sites. High-frequency neural activation by deep brain stimulation is supposed to cancel lower frequency oscillation including beta oscillation, leading to improvement of bradykinesia. Our observation supports the significance of the neural activity pattern, rather than the tonic activity level, in the development of movement disorders. The rate model cannot explain the improvement of ballismus and chorea by pallidotomy because pallidotomy increases the disinhibition of the thalamocortical projection, which should increase the movements. We observed repetitive bursts or pauses of neuronal firing of the globus pallidus synchronized to ballistic movements in patients with hemiballism or chorea, suggesting that phasic neuronal driving in the basal ganglia is important as their pathophysiology.", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "14", "title": "The movers and shakers of deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15386594", "authors": ["Asaad, W", "Eskandar, E"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Nature medicine", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posterior hypothalamic area is a new treatment option for patients with refractory chronic cluster headache (CCH).

The results of this study disclosed that the rhythms expressed in the globus pallidus internus of the untreated parkinsonian patient are not independent and, in particular, the low-beta (13-20 Hz) band generates harmonics that are included in the high-beta (20-35 Hz) band. Conversely, in the dystonic globus pallidus, as well as in the parkinsonian globus pallidus after dopaminergic medication (i.e., in the more \"normal\" condition), the rhythms are substantially independent and characterized by a strong activity in the low-frequency band that generates a second harmonic (4-14 Hz), mostly included in the same band.

This technical inability has led to the development of intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) systems ranging from 0.12-3.0T in strength. The advantages of ioMRI are the excellent soft tissue discrimination and the ability to view the operative site in three dimensions. Enhanced visualization of the intracranial lesion enables the neurosurgeon to choose a safe surgical trajectory that avoids critical structures, to maximize the extent of the tumor resection, and to exclude an intraoperative hemorrhage.

Recently, excessive oscillatory pallidal activity in the 3-10 Hz frequency range, synchronized with dystonic EMG, has been related to the occurrence of involuntary muscle activity in these patients. However, it is unclear whether this pathological synchronization is driven by GP, caused by re-afference from dystonic muscle, or due to a combination of these two processes. Here we used the Directed Transfer Function as a spectral measure to identify the degree and direction of coupling across time between GP and muscle in seven patients with primary dystonia. We show that pallidal local field potential activity <or= 10 Hz is coherent with dystonic movements, and that although the coupling between GP and activity in the sternocleidomastoid muscle is bidirectional, the drive from GP to muscle significantly outweighs that from muscle to GP.

Changes in GPi activity will impact its thalamic targets, representing a possible pathway for STN-DBS to modulate basal ganglia-thalamocortical processing. To study the effect of STN-DBS on thalamic activity, we examined thalamocortical (TC) relay cell responses to an excitatory input train under a variety of inhibitory signals, using a computational model. The inhibitory signals were obtained from single-unit GPi recordings from normal monkeys and from monkeys rendered parkinsonian through arterial 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine injection. The parkinsonian GPi data were collected in the absence of STN-DBS, under sub-therapeutic STN-DBS, and under therapeutic STN-DBS. Our simulations show that inhibition from parkinsonian GPi activity recorded without DBS-compromised TC relay of excitatory inputs compared with the normal case, whereas TC relay fidelity improved significantly under inhibition from therapeutic, but not sub-therapeutic, STN-DBS GPi activity. In a heterogeneous model TC cell population, response failures to the same input occurred across multiple TC cells significantly more often without DBS than in the therapeutic DBS case and in the normal case. Inhibitory signals preceding successful TC relay were relatively constant, whereas those before failures changed more rapidly. Computationally generated inhibitory inputs yielded similar effects on TC relay.

Historically, there has been a dearth of evidence from which to construct rehabilitation interventions that are properly framed, accurately targeted, and credibly measured. In many instances, evidence of treatment response has not been sufficiently robust to demonstrate a change in function that is clinically, statistically, and economically important. Research evidence of activity-dependent central nervous system (CNS) plasticity and the requisite motor learning principles can be used to construct an efficacious motor recovery intervention. Brain plasticity after stroke refers to the regeneration of brain neuronal structures and/or reorganization of the function of neurons. Not only can CNS structure and function change in response to injury, but also, the changes may be modified by \"activity\". For gait training or upper limb functional training for stroke survivors, the \"activity\" is motor behavior, including coordination and strengthening exercise and functional training that comprise motor learning. Critical principles of motor learning required for CNS activity-dependent plasticity include: close-to-normal movements, muscle activation driving practice of movement; focused attention, repetition of desired movements, and training specificity. The ultimate goal of rehabilitation is to restore function so that a satisfying quality of life can be experienced. Accurate measurement of dysfunction and its underlying impairments are critical to the development of accurately targeted interventions that are sufficiently robust to produce gains, not only in function, but also in quality of life. The Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health Model (ICF) model of disablement, put forth by the World Health Organization, can provide not only some guidance in measurement level selection, but also can serve as a guide to incorporate function and quality of life enhancement as the ultimate goals of rehabilitation interventions. Based on the evidence and principles of activity-dependent plasticity and motor learning, we developed gait training and upper limb functional training protocols. Guided by the ICF model, we selected and developed measures with characteristics rendering them most likely to capture change in the targeted aspects of intervention, as well as measures having membership not only in the impairment, but also in the functional or life role participation levels contained in the ICF model. We measured response to innovative gait training using a knee flexion coordination measure, coefficient of coordination consistency (ACC) of relative hip/knee (H/K) movement across multiple steps (H/K ACC), and milestones of participation in life role activities. We measured response to upper limb functional training according to measures designed to quantify functional gains in response to treatment targeted at wrist/hand or shoulder elbow training (Arm Motor Ability Test for wrist/hand (AMAT W/H) or shoulder/elbow (AMAT S/E)). We found that there was a statistically significant advantage for adding FES-IM gait training to an otherwise comparable and comprehensive gait training, according to the following measures: H/K ACC, the measure of consistently executed hip/knee coordination during walking; a specific measure of isolated joint knee flexion coordination; and a measure of multiple coordinated gait components. Further, enhanced gains in gait component coordination were robust enough to result in achievement of milestones in participation in life role activities. In the upper limb functional training study, we found that robotics + motor learning (ROB ML; shoulder/elbow robotics practice plus motor learning) produced a statistically significant gain in AMAT S/E; whereas functional electrical stimulation + motor learning (FES ML) did not. We found that FES ML (wrist/hand FES plus motor learning) produced a statistically significant gain in AMAT W/H; whereas ROB ML did not. These results together, support the phenomenon of training specificity in that the most practiced joint movements improved in comparison to joint movements that were practiced at a lesser intensity and frequency. Both ROB ML and FES ML protocols addressed an array of impairments thought to underlie dysfunction. If we are willing to adhere to the ICF model, we accept the challenge that the goal of rehabilitation is life role participation, with functional improvement as in important intermediary step. The ICF model suggests that we intervene at multiple lower levels (e.g., pathology and impairment) in order to improve the higher levels of function and life role participation. The ICF model also suggests that we measure at each level. Not only can we then understand response to treatment at each level, but also, we can begin to understand relationships between levels (e.g., impairment and function). With the ICF model proffering the challenge of restoring life role participation, it then becomes important to design and test interventions that result in impairment gains sufficiently robust to be reflected in functional activities and further, in life role participation. Fortunately, CNS plasticity and associated motor learning principles can serve well as the basis for generating such interventions. These principles were useful in generating both efficacious gait training and efficacious upper limb functional training interventions. These principles led to the use of therapeutic agents (FES and robotics) so that close-to-normal movements could be practiced. These principles supported the use of specific therapeutic agents (BWSTT, FES, and robotics) so that sufficient movement repetition could be provided. These principles also supported incorporation of functional task practice and the demand of attention to task practice within the intervention. The ICF model provided the challenge to restore function and life role participation. The means to that end was provided by principles of CNS plasticity and motor learning.", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "A portable device for intensive care brain function monitoring with event-related potentials.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15322914", "authors": ["Tiihonen, P", "Kinnunen, J", "T\u00f6yr\u00e4s, J", "Mervaala, E", "P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen, A"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "abstract": "The goal of this study was to assess the effect of bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) on levodopa-induced diphasic dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Multicenter study on deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: an independent assessment of reported adverse events at 4 years.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "175886", "authors": ["Hariz, MI", "Rehncrona, S", "Quinn, NP", "Speelman, JD", "Wensing, C", ""], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Six PD patients with diphasic dyskinesia were included in this study.

Despite the available treatment options (pharmacotherapy, surgery, and vagus nerve stimulation), a large percentage of patients continue to have seizures. With the success of deep brain stimulation for treatment of movement disorders, brain stimulation has received renewed attention as a potential treatment option for epilepsy. Responsive stimulation aims to suppress epileptiform activity by delivering stimulation directly in response to electrographic activity. Animal and human data support the concept that responsive stimulation can abort epileptiform activity, and this modality may be a safe and effective treatment option for epilepsy. Responsive stimulation has the advantage of specificity. In contrast to the typically systemic administration of pharmacotherapy, with the concomitant possibility of side effects, electrical stimulation can be targeted to the specific brain regions involved in the seizure. In addition, responsive stimulation provides temporal specificity. Treatment is provided as needed, potentially reducing the likelihood of functional disruption or habituation due to continuous treatment. Here we review current animal and human research in responsive brain stimulation for epilepsy and then discuss the NeuroPace RNS System, an investigational implantable responsive neurostimulator system that is being evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial to assess the safety and efficacy of responsive stimulation for the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy.", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "168", "title": "Validation of a fiducial-based atlas localization method for deep brain stimulation contacts in the area of the subthalamic nucleus.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "8281445", "authors": ["Videen, TO", "Campbell, MC", "Tabbal, SD", "Karimi, M", "Hershey, T", "Perlmutter, JS"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "Many patients who suffer from medically refractory epilepsy are not candidates for resective brain surgery.

Currently available data indicate that effective DBS overrides pathological bursts, low frequency oscillations, synchronization, and disrupted firing patterns present in movement disorders, and replaces them with more regularized firing. Although it is likely that the specific mechanism(s) by which DBS exerts its effects varies between diseases and target nuclei, the overriding of pathological activity appears to be ubiquitous.

It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of \"normal\" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Automatic trajectory planning for deep brain stimulation: a feasibility study.", "issue": "Pt 1", "pmid": "10323285", "authors": ["Brunenberg, EJ", "Vilanova, A", "Visser-Vandewalle, V", "Temel, Y", "Ackermans, L", "Platel, B", "ter Haar Romeny, BM"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The goal of this study was to determine the relative contributions of unilateral DBS to the effects seen with bilateral DBS. Motor (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III, UPDRS) and working memory function (Spatial Delayed Response, SDR) were measured in 49 PD patients with bilateral STN DBS while stimulators were Both-off, Left-on, Right-on and Both-on in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients were off PD medications overnight. Effects of unilateral DBS were compared to effects of bilateral STN DBS. Mean UPDRS and SDR responses to Left-on vs. Right-on conditions did not differ (p>.20). However, improvement in contralateral UPDRS was greater and SDR performance was more impaired by unilateral DBS in the more affected side of the brain than in the less affected side of the brain (p=.008). The effect of unilateral DBS on the more affected side on contralateral UPDRS and SDR responses was equivalent to that of bilateral DBS. These results suggest that motor and working memory function respond to unilateral STN DBS differentially depending on the asymmetry of motor symptoms.", "pages": "425-8; author reply 428-9"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Auditory midbrain implant: histomorphologic effects of long-term implantation and electric stimulation of a new deep brain stimulation array.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "18236336", "authors": ["Lenarz, M", "Lim, HH", "Lenarz, T", "Reich, U", "Marquardt, N", "Klingberg, MN", "Paasche, G", "Reuter, G", "Stan, AC"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology", "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is prevalent, chronic, and potentially disabling.
