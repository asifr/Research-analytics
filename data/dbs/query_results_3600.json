Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be effective and safe in the management of various, refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, including obesity. The authors review the literature implicating various neural regions in the pathophysiology of obesity, as well as the evidence supporting these regions as targets for DBS, in order to explore the therapeutic promise of DBS in obesity. The lateral hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus are the appetite and satiety centers in the brain, respectively. Substantial data support targeting these regions with DBS for the purpose of appetite suppression and weight loss. However, reward sensation associated with highly caloric food has been implicated in overconsumption as well as obesity, and may in part explain the failure rates of conservative management and bariatric surgery. Thus, regions of the brain's reward circuitry, such as the nucleus accumbens, are promising alternatives for DBS in obesity control.

Materials and Methods.\u2002 To evaluate the brain shift during bilateral STN-DBS, the position of the anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), midcommissure point (MC), and tip of the frontal lobe and anterior horn of the lateral ventricle were calculated pre- and poststereotactic operations in the three-dimensional direction employing special software (Leksell SurgiPlan). To determine the predictive factors for a brain shift, patient's age, operation hours, width of the third ventricle, bicaudate index (BCI), and cella media index (CMI) were compared with the shift of MC. Results.\u2002 In 50 patients, the MC shifted mainly in the posterior direction (y-axis: 1.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0mm), and the shifts in the inferior direction (z-axis: 0.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0mm) and lateral direction (x-axis: 0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0mm) were small. The shift of the MC in the posterior direction correlated well with the shift of the tip of the anterior lobe and anterior horn. Among the predictive factors examined, namely, the patient's age, operation hours, width of the third ventricle, BCI, and CMI, only the CMI showed a correlation with the shift of the MC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, Pearson's correlation coefficient; and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, logistic regression analysis). Conclusions.\u2002 In bilateral STN-DBS, brain shift occurred mainly in the posterior direction, and the CMI is useful for the prediction of a brain shift.

We compared cognitive performance of 22 PD patients who underwent unilateral DBS to the GPi or STN to that of 19 PD controls at baseline and 12 months. We hypothesized that compared to PD controls, DBS patients would decline on tasks involving dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuitry (letter fluency, semantic fluency, and Digit Span Backward) but not on other tasks (Vocabulary, Boston Naming Test), and that a greater proportion of DBS patients would fall below Reliable Change Indexes (RCIs). Compared to controls, DBS patients declined only on the fluency tasks. Analyses classified 50% of DBS patients as decliners, compared to 11% of controls. Decliners experienced less motor improvement than non-decliners. The present study adds to the literature through its hypothesis-driven method of task selection, inclusion of a disease control group, longer-term follow-up and use of Reliable Change. Our findings provide evidence that unilateral DBS surgery is associated with verbal fluency declines and indicate that while these changes may not be systematically related to age, cognitive or depression status at baseline, semantic fluency declines may be more common after left-sided surgery.

It is classified as an impulse control disorder and is widely understood as a nonpharmacological addiction. PG has been reported as a complication in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). The prevalence of PG in PD has been reported to range between 1.7 and 7% compared to a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population. Though there is no survey that indicates the prevalence of PG in Japanese PD patients, problematic gambling behaviors in PD are occasionally observed. In addition to PG other impulse control behaviors and punding (repetitive stereotyped behavior) are recognized as components of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which is characterized by the compulsive use of dopaminergic medications, including levodopa and subcutaneous apomorphine. Though PG can occur with DDS it often occurs in isolation. The vast majority of PG seen in PD is related to dopamine agonists (DA). With regard to the administration of oral DA, pramipexole may induce a higher degree of PG than other types of oral DA due to its disproportionate stimulation of dopamine D3 receptors. However, the differences between the observed effects of various classes of oral DA were insignificant. PG associated with levodopa mono-therapy is uncommon, but in the majority of cases levodopa is co-prescribed. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) was recently introduced to treat advanced PD. An improvement in PG symptoms following STN-DBS has been reported due to a marked decrease in dopaminergic medications. However, in some patients, PG developed following STN-DBS despite the significant reduction or discontinuation of DA. STN-DBS per se may be a potential initiator of PG. Younger age of PD onset, novelty seeking personality traits, history of alcohol abuse, and impulsivity traits were significant predictors of PG.

To address this issue, we have examined the effects of excitotoxic lesion of CM/Pf and of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of nigral dopamine neurons, separately or in association, on gene expression of markers of neuronal activity in the rat basal ganglia (striatal neuropeptide precursors, GAD67, cytochrome oxidase subunit I) by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry. CM/Pf lesion prevented the changes produced by the dopamine denervation in the components of the indirect pathway connecting the striatum to the output structures (striatopallidal neurons, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus), and among the output structures, in the entopeduncular nucleus. Preliminary data on the effects of deep brain stimulation of CM/Pf in rats with nigral dopamine lesion show that this surgical approach produces efficient anti-akinetic effect associated with partial reversal of the dopamine lesion-induced increase in striatal preproenkephalin A mRNA levels, a marker of the striatopallidal neurons.

Here we extend this work; recording the effect of STN-DBS upon cortical EEG and akinesia, in unanesthetized rats rendered cataleptic by acute dopaminergic blockade. STN-DBS-like stimulation resulted in a short latency, presumed antidromic, evoked potential in the cortex. In cataleptic animals, there was a significant increase in the power of beta oscillations in the electroencephalography which was reversed by stimulation that evoked the cortical response. We also observed a significant rescue of motor function, with the level of akinesia (bar test score) being inversely correlated to the amplitude of the evoked potential (R2 = 0.84). These data confirm that (probably antidromic) short latency cortical responses occur in the awake animal and that these are associated with reductions in abnormal cortical oscillations characteristic of PD and with improvements in akinesia.

Indeed, HFS as an extracellular stimulation is expected to activate subsets of both afferent and efferent axons, leading to antidromic spikes that collide with ongoing spontaneous ones and orthodromic spikes that evoke synaptic responses in target neurons. The present review suggests that HFS interfere with spontaneous pathological patterns by introducing a regular activity in several nodal points of the network.

However, the mechanisms by which HFS alleviates these symptoms are not understood. Whereas initial studies focused on HFS-induced changes in neuronal firing rates, recent studies suggest that changes in patterns of neuronal activity may correlate with symptom alleviation. We hypothesized that effective STN HFS reduces the disorder of neuronal firing patterns in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, minimizing the pathological activity associated with parkinsonism. Stimulating leads were implanted in the STN of two rhesus monkeys rendered parkinsonian by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Action potentials were recorded from neurons of the internal and external globus pallidus and the motor thalamus (ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars oralis, and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis) during HFS that reduced motor symptoms and during clinically ineffective low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Firing pattern entropy was calculated from the recorded spike times to quantify the disorder of the neuronal activity. The firing pattern entropy of neurons within each region of the pallidum and motor thalamus decreased in response to HFS (n > or = 18 and P < or = 0.02 in each region), whereas firing rate changes were specific to pallidal neurons only. In response to LFS, firing rates were unchanged, but firing pattern entropy increased throughout the circuit (n > or = 24 and P < or = 10(-4) in each region).

Because the sensory and motor systems are interconnected in embryogenesis, how extrinsic sensory activation guides multimodal differentiation is an important topic. Further, it is unknown whether extrinsic stimulation experienced near sensory sensitivity onset contributes to persistent brain changes, ultimately affecting postnatal behavior. To determine the effects of extrinsic stimulation on multimodal development, we delivered auditory stimulation to bobwhite quail groups during early, middle, or late embryogenesis, and then tested postnatal behavioral responsiveness to auditory or visual cues. Auditory preference tendencies were more consistently toward the conspecific stimulus for animals stimulated during late embryogenesis. Groups stimulated during middle or late embryogenesis showed altered postnatal species-typical visual responsiveness, demonstrating a persistent multimodal effect. We also examined whether auditory-related brain regions are receptive to extrinsic input during middle embryogenesis by measuring postnatal cellular activation. Stimulated birds showed a greater number of ZENK-immunopositive cells per unit volume of brain tissue in deep optic tectum, a midbrain region strongly implicated in multimodal function. We observed similar results in the medial and caudomedial nidopallia in the telencephalon. There were no ZENK differences between groups in inferior colliculus or in caudolateral nidopallium, avian analog to prefrontal cortex.

In this study, we developed a three-dimensional computational model of GPi-DBS in nonhuman primates to investigate how membrane channel dynamics, synaptic inputs, and axonal collateralization contribute to the neural responses generated during stimulation. We focused our analysis on three general neural elements that surround GPi-DBS electrodes: GPi somatodendritic segments, GPi efferent axons, and globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) fibers of passage. During high-frequency electrical stimulation (136 Hz), somatic activity in the GPi showed interpulse excitatory phases at 1-3 and 4-5.5 ms. When including stimulation-induced GABA(A) and AMPA receptor dynamics into the model, the somatic firing patterns continued to be entrained to the stimulation, but the overall firing rate was reduced (78.7 to 25.0 Hz, P < 0.001). In contrast, axonal output from GPi neurons remained largely time-locked to each pulse of the stimulation train. Similar entrainment was also observed in GPe efferents, a majority of which have been shown to project through GPi en route to the subthalamic nucleus.

Both cell types expressed a low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca(2+) current near threshold for rebound burst discharge (-50 mV) that was consistent with T-type Ca(2+) current, but on average 7 times more current was recorded in transient burst cells. The number and frequency of spikes in rebound bursts was tightly correlated with the peak Ca(2+) current at -50 mV, showing a direct relationship between the availability of LVA Ca(2+) current and spike output. Transient burst cells exhibited a larger spike depolarizing afterpotential that was insensitive to blockers of voltage-gated Na(+) or Ca(2+) channels. In comparison, weak burst cells exhibited larger afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) that reduced cell excitability and rebound spike output. The sensitivity of AHPs to Ca(2+) channel blockers suggests that both LVA and high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels trigger AHPs in weak burst compared with only HVA Ca(2+) channels in transient burst cells.

Seventeen participants with PD who had received STN DBS completed the HMGT in on and off stimulation conditions. Twenty-one non-neurologically impaired participants acted as controls. PD participants (in both on and off stimulation conditions) generated significantly fewer meanings than control participants and consistent with the previous reports of verbal fluency impairment, PD participants produced fewer definitions in the on stimulation condition. PD participants (in both on and off stimulation conditions) also had greater difficulty generating definitions for nonhomographic homophones compared with homographic homographs.

Cortical targets are especially appealing, because they are easily accessible by noninvasive or invasive methods. Applicable techniques include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial electrical stimulation using pulsed or direct current, and epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) with surgically implanted electrodes. In contrast to deep brain stimulation in movement disorders or electroconvulsive therapy in depression, the efficacy of cortical stimulation to treat neurological or psychiatric disorders has not been yet clearly demonstrated. However, encouraging results have been reported in neuropathic pain (for ECS) and depression (for rTMS). In this review, we will consider some principles and mechanisms of action of these methods. First, it must be noted that fibers of intracortical or cortico-subcortical networks are more prone to be activated by the stimulation than cell bodies of local cortical neurons. Hence, the site(s) of action may be distant from the site of stimulation. In addition, various parameters of stimulation (such as stimulation frequency, intensity, or electrode polarity) and the configuration of the induced electrical field greatly influence the nature of the recruited circuits, and therefore, the overall efficacy. Finally, clinical changes may be delayed and prolonged beyond the time of stimulation, complicating programming algorithms in the case of implanted stimulation device. All these features need to be taken into account when considering cortical stimulation as a method of treatment.", "pages": "625-34"}, {"volume": "23 Suppl 2", "title": "Deep brain stimulation effect on freezing of gait.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1933236", "authors": ["Ferraye, MU", "Deb\u00fb, B", "Pollak, P"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The nucleus accumbens is gaining interest as a target for deep brain stimulation in refractory neuropsychiatric disorders with impulsivity as core symptom. The nucleus accumbens is composed of two subterritories, core and shell, which have different anatomical connections. Here, we tested the hypothesis that stimulation of the nucleus accumbens core and shell would have different effects on impulsivity. Rats received bilateral stimulation at the level of the nucleus accumbens core or shell during a reaction time task. Stimulation of the nucleus accumbens core significantly decreased impulsivity, while stimulation of the shell increased it. Our results support the hypothesis that the nucleus accumbens is a potential target to treat neuropsychiatric disorders related to impulsivity by deep brain stimulation. However, different behavioral effects resulting from stimulation of the subterritories should be taken into account.", "pages": "625-34"}]
