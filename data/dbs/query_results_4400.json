To test this hypothesis, extracellular recordings of GPi neuronal activity were obtained during stereotactic surgery for the implantation of DBS electrodes in seven idiopathic CD and 14 PD patients.

However, the post-operative body weight gain involved may limit the benefits of surgery and induce critical metabolic disorders. Twenty-four Parkinsonians (61.1 +/- 1.4 years) were examined 1 month before (M - 1) and 3 months after (M + 3) surgery. Body composition and energy expenditure (EE) were measured (1) over 36 h in calorimetric chambers (CC) with rigorous control of food intakes and activities [sleep metabolic rate, resting activities, meals, 3 or 4 sessions of 20 min on a training bicycle at 13 km/h and daily EE] and (2) in resting conditions (basal metabolic rate) during an acute L-dopa challenge (M - 1) or according to acute 'off' and 'on' stimulation (M + 3). Before surgery, EE was compared between the Parkinsonian patients and healthy subjects matched for height and body composition (metabolic rate during sleep, daily EE) or matched to predicted values (basal metabolic rate). Before surgery, in Parkinsonian men but not women, (1) daily EE was higher while sleep metabolic rate was lower compared to healthy matched men (+9.2 +/- 3.9 and -8.2 +/- 2.3%, respectively, P < 0.05) and (2) basal metabolic rate (L-dopa 'on') was higher than predicted basal metabolic rate (+11.5 +/- 4.0%, P < 0.05) but was further increased without L-dopa (+8.4 +/- 3.2% vs L-dopa 'on', P < 0.05).

Daily EE decreased significantly in both men and women (-7.3 +/- 2.2% and -13.1 +/- 1.7%, respectively, P < 0.01) but there was no correlation between daily EE changes and body weight gain. Parkinson's disease is associated with profound alterations in the central control of energy metabolism. Normalization of energy metabolism after DBS-STN implantation may favour body weight gain, of which quality was gender specific. As men gained primarily fat-free mass, a reasonable weight gain may be tolerated, in contrast with women who gained only fat.

Despite optimal drug therapies it is estimated that approximately 50% of patients with ET have medication-resistant tremor. ET can cause more functional impairment than parkinsonian resting tremor because most prominent components of ET are postural and kinetic ones. For patients with drug-resistant debilitating tremor, surgical therapy (thalamotomy) and more recently deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) is a viable treatment modality. Several long-term studies have confirmed the high effectiveness rate of ablative surgery and thalamic DBS in the treatment of ET. The most striking advantage of thalamic DBS is the possibility of performing bilateral surgery in one operative session with a significantly lower rate of side effects. Nowadays the bilateral staged thalamotomy is performed rarely because of unacceptable side effects. Moreover, many authors have observed that in bilaterally stimulated patients the head and voice tremor have diminished in postoperative course.

Despite substantial advancement in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy over the last decades a residual group of very ill patients with a chronic disease and high suicidal risk remains. Modern theories about the pathophysiology of depression are derived from studies examining the mechanism of antidepressants influencing the serotonergic (5-HT) and noradrenergic (NE) systems. Serotonergic fibers originate from the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN), noradrenergic fibers from the locus coeruleus (LC). Both nuclei represent relatively small brain regions and both are controlled to some extent by the habenular complex. We propose the hypothesis of an overactivation of the habenula in human major depressive episodes (MDE's). Increased activation of the lateral habenular nucleus leads to the down regulation of the serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic systems and stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Functional inhibition of the lateral habenula via deep brain stimulation (DBS) has antidepressive properties. The hypothesis is based on the findings of a clinical imaging study examining the habenular after tryptophan depletion and on several animal studies which are discussed. Providing that our hypothesis will be validated by an analogous tyrosine depletion study and additional preclinical studies, the next logical step would be to directly test our hypothesis in patients.

Performance data and a scan-path analysis based on eye movement support the use of landmarks in the environment for coding lamp position and increasing spatial updating costs with increasing changes of PoV indicating allocentric coding strategies during all conditions (0 degrees - to 180 degrees -condition). Subtraction analysis using SPM revealed that a parieto-temporo-frontal network including left medial temporal areas was activated during this 3D visuospatial task, independent of angular difference. The activity of the left parahippocampal area and the left lingual gyrus (but not the hippocampus) correlated with increasing changes of the PoV between encoding and retrieval, emphasizing their specific role in spatial scene memory and allocentric coding. The results suggest that these areas are involved in a continuous matching process between internal representations of the environment and the external status quo.

Dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease increases basal ganglia output, then decreases thalamocortical output, leading to bradykinesia. This model, however, cannot explain a lack of deterioration of parkinsonian signs following thalamic coagulation surgery. Instead of the rate model, the beta oscillation hypothesis has been proposed, explaining that synchronized oscillation in the beta frequency in the basal ganglia disturbs initiation of voluntary movement. We observed that effective high-frequency STN stimulation in parkinsonian monkeys was associated with increase in the firing rate and the pattern shift from irregular burst firing to regular high-frequency firing in the projecting sites. High-frequency neural activation by deep brain stimulation is supposed to cancel lower frequency oscillation including beta oscillation, leading to improvement of bradykinesia. Our observation supports the significance of the neural activity pattern, rather than the tonic activity level, in the development of movement disorders. The rate model cannot explain the improvement of ballismus and chorea by pallidotomy because pallidotomy increases the disinhibition of the thalamocortical projection, which should increase the movements.

Within this model, DBS performance is assessed in two ways. First, we determine the extent to which DBS causes Gpi (globus pallidus pars interna) synaptic outputs, which are burstlike and synchronized in the unstimulated Parkinsonian state, to cease their pathological modulation of simulated thalamocortical cells. Second, we evaluate how DBS affects the GPi cells' auto- and cross-correlograms. In both cases, a nonlinear closed-loop learning algorithm identifies effective DBS inputs that are optimized to have minimal strength. The network dynamics that result differ from the regular, entrained firing which some previous studies have associated with conventional high-frequency DBS.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery provides a unique opportunity to assess these different ideas since neuronal activity can be directly recorded from PD patients. The emerging data suggest that the pathophysiologic changes include derangements in the overall firing rates, decreased neuronal selectivity, and increased neuronal oscillation and synchronization.

Consideration of each characteristic separately entails an increased risk of a false positive decision (a wrongful decision that the patient is abnormal, or a type 1 error). From a statistical point of view this calls for a multivariate analysis. In this paper, we propose two approaches to perform normative comparisons for such multivariate data: Bonferroni corrected univariate comparisons and a multivariate comparison. Both approaches allow for the testing of unidirectional (two-sided) as well as directional (one-sided) hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis that a patient deviates in a negative sense from the norm. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to check if the type I error of both approaches is adequately controlled, and to investigate the power of both approaches to detect deviation from the norm. The results indicate that the type I error rate of both approaches is correct, even in small samples. The results also indicate that the power is higher for the univariate approach if the normative sample size is very small (i.e. just exceeds the number of tests administered). In larger samples, the multivariate comparison has in general increased power.

Stereotaxic injection of the vectors provides continuous and selective expression of therapeutic proteins throughout the target area in primate brains without toxicity. Three phase I clinical trials for gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) using rAAV vectors are currently underway. One trial involves gene transfer of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), an enzyme that converts L-dopa to dopamine, to restore therapeutic windows of orally administered L-dopa in advanced idiopathic PD. After AADC transduction, the daily required dose of L-dopa can be reduced and the duration of the ON period is prolonged. Another trial involves transduction of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with rAAV vectors expressing glutamic acid decarboxylases, a rate-limiting enzyme for synthesizing inhibitory the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This strategy, which is similar to deep brain stimulation, aims at modulating hyperactive STN neurons, thereby alter the resulting activity of down-stream targets, which influence movement. However, the mechanism of stimulation remains unknown, and there are some theoretical concerns of chemical alteration. The other trial involves delivery of rAAV vectors expressing neurturin, a natural analog of a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, into the putamen to slow down the ongoing degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Positron emission tomography with various tracers has been used to monitor the effects of therapeutic gene expression in vivo.

Data on overnight sleep was acquired from 12 healthy, young adult, volunteer males; those on awake stage were obtained from 19 matched males. Brain activity was obtained in response to auditory stimuli (2000 Hz deviant and 1000 Hz standard stimuli: 65 dB, 10 ms r/f time, 50 ms duration) under passive oddball paradigm in sleep, active and passive oddball (OB-a, OB-p, respectively) paradigms in wakefulness. The effect of the experimental variables (stimulus type, sleep stage) was studied using 2 x 4 analysis of variance for repeated measures and stepwise multiple regression analysis. Overall, three types of configurations were obtained for the oscillatory responses which varied according to sleep stage and stimulus type: Large amplitude, differentiated delta and distinct theta response of long duration; distinct theta response with short duration; distinct delta response. As in wakefulness, the morphology of the time-domain peaks was found to be due to the superposition of the delta and theta responses. The configuration in REM resembled the responses to the OB-p paradigm and that NREM stages resembled the responses to the OB-a paradigm in wakefulness. Auditory information processing selectively varied according to sleep stages and took longer in sleep. Comparable peaks were obtained at longer latencies and later components appeared that did not exist under wakefulness.

In vitro studies have provided deep insights into the role of ion channels in response to brain stimulation. In vivo studies reveal neural responses in the context of intact neural circuits. Most importantly, recording of neural responses to behaviorally effective DBS in freely moving animals provides a direct means for examining how DBS modulates the basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits and thereby improves motor function. DBS can modulate firing rate, normalize irregular burst firing patterns and reduce low-frequency oscillations associated with the Parkinsonian state. Our current efforts are focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which DBS effects on neural circuitry improve motor performance.

In both disorders, motor disability results from complex interaction between kinetic tremor and accompanying ataxia with voluntary movements. In clinical studies, the efficacy of thalamic DBS has been thoroughly assessed. However, the optimal anatomical target structure for neurostimulation is still debated and has never been analysed in conjunction with objective measurements of the different aspects of motor impairment. In 10 essential tremor and 11 multiple sclerosis patients, we analysed the effect of thalamic DBS through each contact of the quadripolar electrode on the contralateral tremor rating scale, accelerometry and kinematic measures of reach-to-grasp-movements. These measures were correlated with the anatomical position of the stimulating electrode in stereotactic space and in relation to nuclear boundaries derived from intraoperative microrecording. We found a significant impact of the stereotactic z-coordinate of stimulation contacts on the TRS, accelerometry total power and spatial deviation in the deceleration and target period of reach-to-grasp-movements. Most effective contacts clustered within the subthalamic area (STA) covering the posterior Zona incerta and prelemniscal radiation. Stimulation within this region led to a mean reduction of the lateralized tremor rating scale by 15.8 points which was significantly superior to stimulation within the thalamus (P < 0.05, student's t-test). STA stimulation resulted in reduction of the accelerometry total power by 99%, whereas stimulation at the ventral thalamic border (68%) or within the thalamus proper (2.5%) was significantly less effective (P < 0.01). Concomitantly, STA stimulation led to a significantly higher increase of tremor frequency and decrease in EMG synchronization compared to stimulation within the thalamus proper (P < 0.001). In reach-to-grasp movements, STA stimulation reduced the spatial variability of the movement path in the deceleration period by 28.9% and in the target period by 58.4%, whereas stimulation within the thalamus was again significantly less effective (P < 0.05), with a reduction in the deceleration period between 6.5 and 21.8% and in the target period between 1.2 and 11.3%. An analysis of the nuclear boundaries from intraoperative microrecording confirmed the anatomical impression that most effective electrodes were located within the STA. Our data demonstrate a profound effect of deep brain stimulation of the thalamic region on tremor and ataxia in essential tremor and tremor caused by multiple sclerosis. The better efficacy of stimulation within the STA compared to thalamus proper favours the concept of a modulation of cerebello-thalamic projections underlying the improvement of these symptoms.", "pages": "319-25"}, {"volume": "149", "title": "Use of a single semilinear incision in Deep Brain Stimulation for movement disorders.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "17513646", "authors": ["Kouyialis, AT", "Boviatsis, EJ", "Ziaka, DS", "Sakas, DE"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "To determine whether low-frequency, 1-Hz sine-wave stimulation (LFS) applied to a fully kindled amygdala focus would show antiepileptic properties in rats that were either naturally seizure prone (Fast) or seizure resistant (Slow).", "pages": "319-25"}, {"volume": "48", "title": "High frequency thalamic stimulation for inoperable mesial temporal epilepsy.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "17508162", "authors": ["Osorio, I", "Overman, J", "Giftakis, J", "Wilkinson, SB"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Epilepsia", "abstract": "Normal twisted and/or \"spanning\" bipolar electrode configurations were implanted in the amygdalae of adult male Fast and Slow rats.
