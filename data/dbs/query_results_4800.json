The source of LEPs has not been identified, and several somatic representations and cytoarchitectonic areas may be present in this complex region. To overcome the limitations of human studies, a primate model is needed in which the main LEP generator in this region can be localized and characterized using invasive methods. We obtained EEG recordings of evoked responses to noxious laser stimulation at different intensities and performed dipole source analyses in three anesthetized macaque monkeys. We show that LEPs can be recorded that 1) grade with stimulus intensity, 2) display two distinct responses corresponding to the \"late\" (Adelta-fiber) and the \"ultralate\" (C-fiber) LEPs recorded in humans, and 3) originate deep within the operculoinsular region, thus establishing a valid primate model for experimental analysis of LEPs. Further, we found that LEPs elicited from the leg, arm, and ear display a global somatotopy organized in the posteroanterior direction (leg posterior and arm and ear anterior), which contrasts starkly with the mediolateral (leg to face) gradient of the somatotopic representations in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. These results provide evidence that the main generator of pain-related activity in operculoinsular cortex may participate in both the somatic localization and the intensity discrimination of pain sensations, and they indicate that it may be distinct from the traditional somatosensory cortices.", "pages": "2802-8"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "A review of diagnostic and functional imaging in headache.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16897620", "authors": ["May, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The journal of headache and pain", "abstract": "The neuroimaging of headache patients has revolutionised our understanding of the pathophysiology of primary headaches and provided unique insights into these syndromes. Modern imaging studies point, together with the clinical picture, towards a central triggering cause. The early functional imaging work using positron emission tomography shed light on the genesis of some syndromes, and has recently been refined, implying that the observed activation in migraine (brainstem) and in several trigeminal-autonomic headaches (hypothalamic grey) is involved in the pain process in either a permissive or triggering manner rather than simply as a response to first-division nociception per se. Using the advanced method of voxel-based morphometry, it has been suggested that there is a correlation between the brain area activated specifically in acute cluster headache--the posterior hypothalamic grey matter--and an increase in grey matter in the same region. No structural changes have been found for migraine and medication overuse headache, whereas patients with chronic tension-type headache demonstrated a significant grey matter decrease in regions known to be involved in pain processing. Modern neuroimaging thus clearly suggests that most primary headache syndromes are predominantly driven from the brain, activating the trigeminovascular reflex and needing therapeutics that act on both sides: centrally and peripherally.", "pages": "2802-8"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Depression and intelligence in patients with Parkinson's disease and deep-brain stimulation.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "16895282", "authors": ["Schadt, CR", "Cox, KL", "Tramontana, MG", "Byrne, DW", "Davis, TL", "Fang, JY", "Konrad, PE", "Padaliya, B", "Mutter, RW", "Gill, CE", "Richardson, CR", "Charles, PD"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of the National Medical Association", "abstract": "The goal of this study is to examine the association of depression with intelligence and education in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation (STN-DBS).

However, a recent summary of clinical evidence on the effectiveness of STN DBS is lacking. We report the results of such a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive review of the literature using Medline and Ovid databases from 1993 until 2004 was conducted. Estimates of change in absolute Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores after surgery were generated using random-effects models. Sources of heterogeneity were explored with meta-regression models, and the possibility of publication bias was evaluated. Patient demographics, reduction in medication requirements, change in dyskinesia, daily offs, quality of life, and a ratio of postoperative improvement from stimulation compared to preoperative improvement by medication from each study were tabulated and average scores were calculated. Adverse effects from each study were summarized. Thirty-seven cohorts were included in the review. Twenty-two studies with estimates of standard errors were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated decreases in absolute UPDRS II (activities of daily living) and III (motor) scores after surgery in the stimulation ON/medication off state compared to preoperative medication off state were 13.35 (95% CI: 10.85-15.85; 50%) and 27.55 (95% CI: 24.23-30.87; 52%), respectively. Average reduction in L-dopa equivalents following surgery was 55.9% (95% CI: 50%-61.8%). Average reduction in dyskinesia following surgery was 69.1% (95% CI: 62.0%-76.2%). Average reduction in daily off periods was 68.2% (95% CI: 57.6%-78.9%). Average improvement in quality of life using PDQ-39 was 34.5% +/- 15.3%. Univariable regression showed improvements in UPDRS III scores were significantly greater in studies with higher baseline UPDRS III off scores, increasing disease duration prior to surgery, earlier year of publication, and higher baseline L-dopa responsiveness. Average baseline UPDRS III off scores were significantly lower (i.e., suggesting milder disease) in later than in earlier studies. In multivariable regression, L-dopa responsiveness, higher baseline motor scores, and disease duration were independent predictors of greater change in motor score. No evidence of publication bias in the available literature was found. The most common serious adverse event related to surgery was intracranial hemorrhage in 3.9% of patients. Psychiatric sequelae were common. Synthesis of the available literature indicates that STN DBS improves motor activity and activities of daily living in advanced PD. Differences between available studies likely reflect differences in patient populations and follow-up periods. These data provide an estimate of the magnitude of the treatment effects and emphasize the need for controlled and randomized studies.", "pages": "2802-8"}, {"volume": "21 Suppl 14", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation: summary and meta-analysis of outcomes.", "issue": "", "pmid": "12499496", "authors": ["Kleiner-Fisman, G", "Herzog, J", "Fisman, DN", "Tamma, F", "Lyons, KE", "Pahwa, R", "Lang, AE", "Deuschl, G"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Until recently, a review of nonpharmacological, somatic treatments of psychiatric disorders would have included only electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

In such cases, surgical intervention may become necessary. Modern surgical approaches to such disorders include radio-frequency lesioning and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is one of the most useful stereotactic targets available: STN DBS is known to induce substantial improvement in patients with end-stage Parkinson's disease. Other targets include the Globus Pallidus pars interna (GPi) for dystonia and Parkinson's disease, and the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMN) for neuropathic pain. Radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive alternative to treat some functional brain disorders. The main technical limitation to radiosurgery is that the target can be selected only on the basis of magnetic resonance anatomy without electrophysiological confirmation. The aim of this work is to provide a method for the correct atlas-based identification of the target to be used in functional neurosurgery treatment planning. The coordinates of STN, CMN, and GPi were identified in the Talairach and Tournoux atlas and transformed to the corresponding regions of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) electronic atlas. Binary masks describing the target nuclei were created. The MNI electronic atlas was deformed onto the patient magnetic resonance imaging-T1 scan by applying an affine transformation followed by a local nonrigid registration. The first transformation was based on normalized cross correlation and the second on optimization of a two-part objective function consisting of similarity criteria and weighted regularization. The obtained deformation field was then applied to the target masks. The minimum distance between the surface of an implanted electrode and the surface of the deformed mask was calculated. The validation of the method consisted of comparing the electrode-mask distance to the clinical outcome of the treatments in ten cases of bilateral DBS implants. Electrode placement may have an effect within a radius of stimulation equal to 2 mm, therefore the registration process is considered successful if error is less than 2 mm. The registrations of the MNI atlas onto the patient space succeeded in all cases. The comparison of the distance to the clinical outcome revealed good agreement: where the distance was high (at least in one implant), the clinical outcome was poor; where there was a close correlation between the structures, clinical outcome revealed an improvement of the pathological condition. In conclusion, the proposed method seems to provide a useful tool for the identification of the target nuclei for functional radiosurgery.

Network quantification disclosed reductions in PDRP activity with both interventions, which correlated with clinical improvement (P < 0.05). The degree of network modulation by therapy did not differ significantly for the two treatment approaches (P > 0.6). These findings support the results of previous imaging studies indicating that effective symptomatic therapies for Parkinson's disease involve a common mechanism.

Ongoing FM pain is referred to deep tissues and is described as widespread but usually is maximally located within a restricted region such as the shoulders. Palpation of deep tissues reveals an enhanced nociceptive sensitivity that is not restricted to regions of clinical pain. Similarly, psychophysical testing reveals allodynia and hyperalgesia for cutaneous stimulation at locations beyond regions of clinical pain referral. The combination of widely distributed clinical pain and generalized hypersensitivity is highly disabling, but no satisfactory treatment is regularly prescribed. A thorough understanding of mechanisms will likely be required to develop and document adequate therapies. The generalized hypersensitivity associated with FM has focused considerable interest on central (CNS) mechanisms for the disorder. These include central sensitization, central disinhibition and a dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the central effects associated with FM can be produced by a peripheral source of pain. Chronic nociceptive input induces central sensitization, magnifying pain, and it activates the HPA and the sympathetic nervous system. Chronic sympathetic activation indirectly sensitizes peripheral nociceptors and sets up a vicious cycle. Thus, it appears that central mechanisms of FM pain are dependent on abnormal peripheral input(s) for development and maintenance of this condition. A substantial literature defines peripheral-CNS-peripheral interactions that are integral to FM pain. These reciprocal actions and related phenomena of relevance to FM pain are reviewed here, leading to suggestions for testing of therapeutic approaches.", "pages": "2802-8"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Biochemical and electrophysiological changes of substantia nigra pars reticulata driven by subthalamic stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "12890973", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Boggio, PS", "Santos, MC", "Lima, M", "Vieira, AL", "Rigonatti, SP", "Silva, MT", "Barbosa, ER", "Nitsche, MA", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Long-duration response (LDR) to levodopa is supposed to decrease with Parkinson disease (PD) progression, but direct observation of this response in advanced PD has never been performed.", "pages": "2802-8"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Noninvasive cortical stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "16893102", "authors": ["Skidmore, FM", "Rodriguez, RL", "Fernandez, HH", "Goodman, WK", "Foote, KD", "Okun, MS"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "To study the LDR to levodopa in patients with advanced PD treated with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS).", "pages": "2802-8"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Lessons learned in deep brain stimulation for movement and neuropsychiatric disorders.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "16892449", "authors": ["Gorman, JM"], "year": "2006", "journal": "CNS spectrums", "abstract": "We studied 30 consecutive patients with PD who underwent subthalamic DBS.

Clinically effective STN-DBS caused a significant increase of the SNr firing rate. The poststimulus histogram (PSTH) showed an excitation peak at 1.92-3.85 ms after the STN stimulus. The spontaneous discharge of SNr neurons was driven at the frequency of the stimulation (130 Hz), as shown in the autocorrelograms (AutoCrl). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis showed a peak at 130 Hz, and a less pronounced second one at 260 Hz. Accordingly, in the distribution of the interspike intervals (ISIs), the mode was earlier, and skewness more asymmetric. Biochemically, the increased excitatory driving from the STN was reflected by a clear-cut increase in cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the SNr.

We aimed to study the effects of another noninvasive technique of cortical brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), on motor function and motor-evoked potential (MEP) characteristics of PD patients. We tested tDCS using different electrode montages [anodal stimulation of primary motor cortex (M1), cathodal stimulation of M1, anodal stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sham-stimulation] and evaluated the effects on motor function--as indexed by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), simple reaction time (sRT) and Purdue Pegboard test--and on corticospinal motor excitability (MEP characteristics).

Surgical outcomes of GPi surgeries might be improved by approaches that better account for the course of motor and non-motor pallidothalamic projections. Although several studies, including our own tracer investigations, suggest that motor projections from GPi principally form the lenticular fasciculus and non-motor projections primarily contribute to the ansa lenticularis, other schemes have perpetuated. Presently, to corroborate the course of pallidothalamic projections and to assess the feasibility of selectively targeting the motor circuit of GPi, radiofrequency lesions were placed in the motor portion of GPi in monkeys. Degenerating pallidothalamic fibers were visualized with amino cupric staining techniques and regional cell counts in GPi were compared with control hemispheres. Lesions restricted to posterior motor portions of GPi produced selective degeneration of LF and only damaged AL if the lesions extended more anteriorly. Marked secondary neuronal loss occurred well beyond the principal lesions but was mainly confined to the posterolateral motor region of GPi. These findings corroborate the original pallidothalamic outflow scheme proposed by Ranson and Ranson.

Mapping strategies vary greatly across centers, but can be broadly categorized into those that use microelectrode or semimicroelectrode techniques to optimize position prior to implantation and macrostimulation through a macroelectrode or the DBS lead, and those that rely solely on macrostimulation and its threshold for clinical effects (benefits and side effects). Microelectrode criteria for implantation into the STN or GPi include length of the nucleus recorded, presence of movement-responsive neurons, and/or distance from the borders with adjacent structures. However, the threshold for the production of clinical benefits relative to side effects is, in most centers, the final, and sometimes only, determinant of DBS electrode position. Macrostimulation techniques for mapping, the utility of microelectrode mapping is reflected in its modification of electrode position in 17% to 87% of patients undergoing STN DBS, with average target adjustments of 1 to 4 mm.

Our candidates for DBS were the globus pallidus internus (GPi) plus the intralaminar thalamic complex (Pf or CM), given its extensive functional links with basal ganglia nuclei. Materials and Methods.\u2002 The routine utilization of our innovative stereotactic apparatus allows us to implant, at the same time, both the CM-Pf complex together with the GPi in six Parkinson disease patients. Both intraoperative and postoperative neurophysiologic assessments helped us recognize functional subregions while optimizing implantation of electrodes. Unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor scores, AIMs, and freezing were carefully blindly evaluated for each condition. Results.\u2002 A significant amelioration of UPDRS scores was achieved by simultaneous activation of both targets. CM-Pf activation was only slightly effective in reducing rigidity and akinesia, but more efficacious on freezing. Not surprisingly, AIMs were peculiarly decreased by the activation of the permanent electro-catheter in the posteroventral GPi.

However, to date, evidence for persistent use-dependent change in the strength of this synapse has been almost entirely absent. Here, we report that high-frequency burst stimulation of mossy fibers, either alone or paired with postsynaptic depolarization, gives rise to long-term depression (LTD) of the mossy fiber-DCN synapse. This form of LTD is not associated with changes in the paired-pulse ratio and is blocked by loading with a postsynaptic Ca2+ chelator but not by bath application of an NMDA receptor antagonist. Mossy fiber-DCN LTD requires activation of a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and protein translation.

Vim DBS improves contralateral parkinsonian tremor. STN and GPi DBS improve contralateral bradykinesia, rigidity, parkinsonian tremor and also levodopa-induced dyskinesia. There is little comparative data between bilateral STN and bilateral GPi procedures but the improvement with bilateral STN DBS seems more pronounced than with bilateral GPi DBS.

Pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at 1 year, pain scores were assessed using both visual analogue scores and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Patients were tested post-operatively to determine whether electrical stimulation of the PAG would modulate blood pressure. We found that the degree of analgesia induced by deep brain stimulation of the rostral PAG in man is related to the magnitude of reduction in arterial blood pressure.

Two samples were studied. The first sample consisted of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) who received deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The second sample consisted of patients who received DBS for the treatment of PD or essential tremor (ET) in the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim). Stop-signal task and go/no-go task performances were studied in both groups. Both groups performed these tasks with (on stimulation) and without (off stimulation) DBS to address the question of whether stimulation is effective in improving choice reaction time (RT) and stop-signal RT. The results show that DBS of the STN was associated with significantly enhanced inhibitory control, as indicated by shorter stop-signal RTs. An additional finding is that DBS of the STN led to significantly shorter choice RT. The effects of DBS on responding and response inhibition were functionally independent. Although DBS of the Vim did not systematically affect task performance in patients with ET, a subgroup of Vim-stimulated PD patients showed enhanced stop-signal RTs in on stimulation versus off stimulation. This result suggests that the change in performance to stop signals may not be directly related to STN function, but rather results from a change in PD function due to DBS in general.

We used the normalized root mean square (NRMS) of a short (5 seconds) MER sampled signal and the estimated anatomical distance to target (EDT) as the basis for this procedure. Electrode tip location was defined intraoperatively by an expert neurophysiologist to be before, within, or after the STN. Data from 46 trajectories of 27 patients were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probability of being in each of these locations, given RMS-EDT pair values. We tested our predictions on each trajectory using a bootstrapping technique, with the rest of the trajectories serving as a training set and found the error in predicting the STN entry to be (mean +/- SD) 0.18 +/- 0.84, and 0.50 +/- 0.59 mm for STN exit point, which yields a 0.30 +/- 0.28 mm deviation from the expert's target center.

Experiments revealed that a specific sequence learning network predicts learning in normal subjects, and in independent cohorts of early and advanced PD patients. The analysis of the relationship of network activity to learning performance revealed diverging influences of dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS of the internal GP and of STN increased network activity and task performance, while levodopa decreased both measures. In separate studies, we investigated the role of dopaminergic modulation on brain activation during sequence learning. In healthy subjects dopamine transporter (DAT) binding correlated with learning-related brain activation in prefrontal, premotor and cingulate cortices, and in the thalamus. By contrast, in PD most of these regional relationships were lost. Only ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation correlated with caudate dopaminergic input.
