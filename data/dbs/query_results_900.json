When closed-loop DBS was applied to a strongly coupled cortico-basal ganglia network, the stimulation energy delivered over a 480 s period was reduced by up to 42%.

While there is a great deal of guidance available for the PD specialist, it remains a challenge for the generalist to know which patients require specialist input, how urgently that input should be obtained and what steps should be taken while awaiting review. Diagnosis can be difficult in the acute setting.

Problems that may present to the general physician include aspiration pneumonia, uncontrolled dyskinesias, psychosis, dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome and rarely, neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome.

Adjusted vestibular-evoked myogenic potential amplitudes were significantly smaller in parkinsonian patients than in controls, in particular in patients without surgery. Administration of dopa, but not subthalamic stimulation, significantly increased amplitudes. Onset latencies were similar for all groups and treatment conditions. Decreased vestibular-evoked myogenic potential amplitudes in parkinsonian patients suggest reduced vestibular nuclei excitability within the brain stem, which is modulated by dopa but not by subthalamic stimulation.

DBS stimulation at various sites in the central autonomic network produces rapid changes in the functioning of specific organs and physiological systems that are distinct from its therapeutic effects on central nervous motor and sensory systems. For example, DBS modulates several parameters of cardiovascular function, including heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability, baroreceptor sensitivity and blood pressure variability. The beneficial effects of DBS also extend to improvements in lung function. This article includes an overview of the anatomy of the central autonomic network, which consists of autonomic nervous system components in the cortex, diencephalon and brainstem that project to the spinal cord or cranial nerves.

To address this in rats, we first examined the distribution of S2 neurons projecting to the trigeminal principal nucleus (Vp) or oral subnucleus (Vo) of the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TSNC) after injections of a retrograde tracer, Fluorogold (FG), into five regions in the Vp/Vo which were responsive to stimulation of trigeminal nerves innervating the orofacial tissues. A large number of FG-labeled neurons were found with a somatotopic arrangement in the dorsal areas of S2 (orofacial S2 area). This somatotopic arrangement in the orofacial S2 area was shown to closely match that of the orofacial afferent inputs by recording cortical surface potentials evoked by stimulation of the trigeminal nerves. We then examined the morphology of descending projections from these electrophysiologically defined areas of the orofacial S2 to the pons and medulla after injections of an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextranamine (BDA), into the areas. A large number of BDA-labeled axon fibers and terminals were seen only in some of the second-order somatosensory neuron pools, most notably in the contralateral TSNC, although the labeled terminals were not seen in certain rostrocaudal levels of the contralateral TSNC including the rostrocaudal middle level of the trigeminal interpolar subnucleus.

Unfortunately, currently available stimulation devices are unsuitable to test behavior in freely-moving mice. As such, no DBS studies in behaving mice have been reported thus far. In order to overcome this limitation we have developed a new light-weight wireless implantable micro stimulator device for mice that delivers biphasic pulse patterns to two individual electrode pairs, mimicking partly the clinical situation. This paper describes in detail the bench-top validation and in vivo implementation of this device. The results in this study indicate that the wireless implantable stimulator in mice reliably delivers continuous bilateral stimulation, importantly, does not restrict the animals mobility and hygiene (grooming behavior). In vivo testing furthermore showed that stimulation of the mice ventral striatum yields similar results as previously shown by others in rats where conventional deep brain stimulation techniques were used.

We demonstrate that a novel method, null-beamforming, can be used to localise accurately brain activity despite the artefacts caused by the presence of DBS electrodes and stimulus pulses.

Using this beamforming method, we examined changes in whole-brain activity comparing pain relief achieved with deep brain stimulation (DBS ON) and compared with pain experienced with no stimulation (DBS OFF). We found significant changes in activity in pain-related regions including the pre-supplementary motor area, brainstem (periaqueductal gray) and dissociable parts of caudal and rostral ACC. In particular, when the patient reported experiencing pain, there was increased activity in different regions of ACC compared to when he experienced pain relief.

Additionally, the effect of STN HF DBS on neural synchrony in functionally connected regions of motor cortex is unknown and is of great interest. Scalp EEG studies demonstrated that stimulation of the STN can activate motor cortex antidromically, but the spatial specificity of this effect has not been examined. The present study examined the effect of STN HF DBS on neural synchrony within the cortico-basal ganglia network in patients with PD. We measured local field potentials dorsal to and within the STN of PD patients, and additionally in the motor cortex in a subset of these patients. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to guide the placement of subdural cortical surface electrodes over the DTI-identified origin of the hyperdirect pathway (HDP) between motor cortex and the STN. The results demonstrated that local beta power was attenuated during HF DBS both dorsal to and within the STN. The degree of attenuation was monotonic with increased DBS voltages in both locations, but this voltage-dependent effect was greater in the central STN than dorsal to the STN (p < 0.05). Cortical signals over the estimated origin of the HDP also demonstrated attenuation of beta hypersynchrony during DBS dorsal to or within STN, whereas signals from non-specific regions of motor cortex were not attenuated.

Objective: To propose chronic electrical stimulation of the dentatothalamocortical pathway as a method for enhancing cortical excitability and improving motor recovery following stroke. Method: In previous studies, motor evoked potentials were derived from intracortical microstimulation and used to index cortical excitability in rats undergoing continuous, asynchronous deep cerebellar stimulation. In a separate set of experiments, the effect of chronic deep cerebellar stimulation on motor recovery was tested in rats following large ischemic strokes. Results: Deep cerebellar stimulation modulated cortical excitability in a frequency-dependent fashion. Beta band stimulation yielded sustained increment in excitability and was associated with enhanced motor recovery compared to sham stimulation. Conclusion: Chronic deep cerebellar stimulation enhances recovery of motor function following large ischemic strokes in the rat, an effect that may be associated with increased cortical excitability.

While the therapeutic benefits of DBS are now recognized, experimental data on its mechanisms and impact at long term remain poor. This is mainly due to the lack of a microstimulation system adapted for chronic DBS in small laboratory animals. In this context, we have developed a microstimulator for DBS adapted to rat. This device, which has a size and weight compatible for use in freely moving rat, can be clipped to a support fixed on the animal's head. This easy \"removal\" property is crucial because it enables removing or even switching the microstimulator during the experiments without having to anaesthetize or to operate the animal, thus minimizing stress. The design of the microstimulator allows to set the DBS parameters easily (intensity, frequency and pulse width) and to replace the battery for long-term DBS. To validate our device, we performed continuous DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (known to improve motor deficits in clinic) in a classical rat model of PD during 5 weeks.

The present study was designed to determine whether there exists a target with a wider therapeutic window for LFS treatment. Therefore, evoked seizures in the rat were induced by amygdala kindling and spontaneous seizures were induced by pilocarpine. The effects of different modes of LFS at the subiculum on the progression and severity of evoked seizures and the frequency of spontaneous seizure were evaluated. We found that (i) LFS at 1Hz delivered to the subiculum before and immediately after the kindling stimulations, or after the cessation of afterdischarge (afterdischarge duration, ADD) decreased the seizure stages and shortened the ADD both in seizure acquisition and expression in amygdaloid-kindled seizures. In addition, even LFS delivered after duration of double the ADD prolonged the kindling progression. (ii) LFS delivered at 1Hz, but not 0.5, 3 or 130Hz, immediately after the cessation of kindling stimulations retarded the progression of kindling seizures. (iii) Pilocarpine-induced spontaneous seizures were completely inhibited by 1Hz LFS.

In cluster headache there is often a considerable diagnostic delay - an average of 7 years in a population-based survey. Cluster headache is characterized by very severe or severe orbital or periorbital pain with a duration of 15-180 minutes. The cluster headache attacks are accompanied by characteristic associated unilateral symptoms such as tearing, nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhoea, eyelid oedema, miosis and/or ptosis. In addition, there is a sense of restlessness and agitation. Patients may have up to eight attacks per day. Episodic cluster headache (ECH) occurs in clusters of weeks to months duration, whereas chronic cluster headache (CCH) attacks occur for more than 1 year without remissions. Management of cluster headache is divided into acute attack treatment and prophylactic treatment. In ECH and CCH the attacks can be treated with oxygen (12 L/min) or subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg. For both oxygen and sumatriptan there are two randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating efficacy. In both ECH and CCH, verapamil is the prophylactic drug of choice. Verapamil 360 mg/day was found to be superior to placebo in one clinical trial. In clinical practice, daily doses of 480-720 mg are mostly used. Thus, the dose of verapamil used in cluster headache treatment may be double the dose used in cardiology, and with the higher doses the PR interval should be checked with an ECG. At the start of a cluster, transitional preventive treatment such as corticosteroids or greater occipital nerve blockade can be given. In CCH and in long-standing clusters of ECH, lithium, methysergide, topiramate, valproic acid and ergotamine tartrate can be used as add-on prophylactic treatment. In drug-resistant CCH, neuromodulation with either occipital nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus is an alternative treatment strategy. For most cluster headache patients there are fairly good treatment options both for acute attacks and for prophylaxis. The big problem is the diagnosis of cluster headache as demonstrated by the diagnostic delay of 7 years. However, the relatively short-lasting attack of pain in one eye with typical associated symptoms should lead the family doctor to suspect cluster headache resulting in a referral to a neurologist or a headache centre with experience in the treatment of cluster headache.", "pages": "233-9"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Lower limb joints kinematics in essential tremor and the effect of thalamic stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16713924", "authors": ["Fasano, A", "Herzog, J", "Raethjen, J", "Rose, FE", "Volkmann, J", "Falk, D", "Deuschl, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Gait & posture", "abstract": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is superior to medical therapy for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), and additional evidence suggests that it improves refractory symptoms of essential tremor, primary generalized dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite this, its therapeutic mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that subthalamic stimulation activates the cerebral cortex at short latencies after stimulus onset during clinically effective stimulation for PD. In 5 subjects (six hemispheres), EEG measured the response of cortex to subthalamic stimulation across a range of stimulation voltages and frequencies. Novel analytical techniques reversed the anode and cathode electrode contacts and summed the resulting pair of event-related potentials to suppress the stimulation artifact. We found that subthalamic brain stimulation at 20 Hz activates the somatosensory cortex at discrete latencies (mean latencies: 1.0 \u00b1 0.4, 5.7 \u00b1 1.1, and 22.2 \u00b1 1.8 ms, denoted as R1, R2, and R3, respectively). The amplitude of the short latency peak (R1) during clinically effective high-frequency stimulation is nonlinearly dependent on stimulation voltage (P < 0.001; repeated-measures analysis of variance), and its latency is less variable than that of R3 (1.02 versus 19.46 ms; P < 0.001, Levene's test). We conclude that clinically effective subthalamic brain stimulation in humans with PD activates the cerebral cortex at 1 ms after stimulus onset, most likely by antidromic activation.
