Each patient received 10, 1-Hz rTMS treatments to suppress a part of R pars triangularis. P1 was a 'good responder' with improved naming and phrase length; P2 was a 'poor responder' without improved naming. Pre-TMS (10 years poststroke), P1 had significant activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex, R IFG, and in both L and R SMA during overt naming fMRI (28% pictures named). At 3 mo. post-TMS (42% named), P1 showed continued activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex, R IFG, and in R and L SMA. At 16 mo. post-TMS (58% named), he also showed significant activation in R and L sensorimotor cortex mouth and R IFG. He now showed a significant increase in activation in the L SMA compared to pre-TMS and at 3 mo. post-TMS (p < .02; p < .05, respectively). At 16 mo. there was also greater activation in L than R SMA (p < .08). At 46 mo. post-TMS (42% named), this new LH pattern of activation continued. He improved on the Boston Naming Test from 11 pictures named pre-TMS, to scores ranging from 14 to 18 pictures, post-TMS (2-43 mo. post-TMS). His longest phrase length (Cookie Theft picture) improved from three words pre-TMS, to 5-6 words post-TMS. Pre-TMS (1.5 years poststroke), P2 had significant activation in R IFG (3% pictures named). At 3 and 6 mo. post-TMS, there was no longer significant activation in R IFG, but significant activation was present in R sensorimotor cortex. On all three fMRI scans, P2 had significant activation in both the L and R SMA. There was no new, lasting perilesional LH activation across sessions for this patient. Over time, there was little or no change in his activation. His naming remained only at 1-2 pictures during all three fMRI scans. His BNT score and longest phrase length remained at one word, post-TMS. Lesion site may play a role in each patient's fMRI activation pattern and response to TMS treatment. P2, the poor responder, had an atypical frontal lesion in the L motor and premotor cortex that extended high, near brain vertex, with deep white matter lesion near L SMA. P2 also had frontal lesion in the posterior middle frontal gyrus, an area important for naming (Duffau et al., 2003); P1 did not. Additionally, P2 had lesion inferior and posterior to Wernicke's area, in parts of BA 21 and 37, whereas P1 did not. The fMRI data of our patient who had good response following TMS support the notion that restoration of the LH language network is linked in part, to better recovery of naming and phrase length in nonfluent aphasia.", "pages": "e15-7"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "STN versus PPN-DBS for alleviating freezing of gait: toward a frequency modulation approach?", "issue": "14", "pmid": "17977270", "authors": ["Moreau, C", "Defebvre, L", "Devos, D", "Marchetti, F", "Dest\u00e9e, A", "Stefani, A", "Peppe, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used in a small number of patients with Tourette's syndrome and results on tics and comorbidities have been promising.

Thus, we examined three groups: chronic cluster headache patients with unilateral DBS of the posterior hypothalamus (n = 11), chronic cluster headache patients without DBS (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 29). Perception and pain thresholds for hot and cold stimuli were determined bilaterally in all subjects supraorbitally, at the forearm, and in the lower leg.

Cold pain thresholds at the first trigeminal branch were increased on the stimulated side in the DBS group compared to healthy subjects (p = .015). The DBS group also had higher cold detection thresholds compared to non-implanted cluster headache patients (p < .05).

For this purpose, specific hardware have been designed, including deep brain electrodes, extensions, and implantable programmable generators (IPGs). In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The HFS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, HFS has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in PET scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction. In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that STN stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel IPGs, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain-computer interfaces.

Twenty-five patients with variable presentations of dystonia were evaluated with videotaped standardized dystonia rating scales at preoperative baseline and at 6 and 12 months following GPi-DBS implantation. These 75 examination videos were retrospectively evaluated, independently and in random order, by two movement disorder neurologists who were blinded to the treatment status. Both neurologists scored each videotaped evaluation using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-motor part (BFMDRS-M) and the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS). A final score for each video was assigned by averaging the raters' scores. An intra-class correlation coefficient was used to calculate inter-rater reliability. A linear mixed model was fitted to investigate the time effect and its interaction with type of dystonia (primary versus secondary) for each rating scale. Inter-rater reliability was excellent. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.994 to 0.997 for both scales at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The average motor improvement scores after GPi DBS for the entire heterogeneous group of dystonia patients after 6 and 12 months of stimulation was 21.32% (p = 0.0010) and 28.95% (p = 0.0017), respectively, when the UDRS score was used. Similar levels of improvement 20.46% (p = 0.0055) at 6 months and 27.39% (p = 0.00197) at 12 months were found using the BFMDRS-M score. Analysis using unblinded scores from our database revealed a 32.99 and 37.27% UDRS improvement at 6 and 12 months, and an improvement in UDRS score of 38.5 and 43.7% when the analysis was limited to only primary dystonia. If the data were further segregated to include only cases of DYT-1 primary generalized dystonia, the UDRS benefit increased to 48.24%. Our primary dystonia group was diluted by the presence of both old- and young-onset patients, as well as focal, segmental and generalized dystonia. In conclusion, (1) evaluating motor outcomes of DBS therapy for dystonia using independent, randomized retrospective rating by blinded raters' results in lower improvement scores than when outcomes are rated by unblinded treating neurologists. Blinded methodology may be superior and might produce a more realistic assessment of motor outcomes after DBS in patients with dystonia; (2) outcomes were similar whether the BFMDRS-M or UDRS was utilized; (3) GPi-DBS was effective in treating sustained involuntary motor co-contractions in medication refractory dystonia patients, more so in primary dystonia.", "pages": "e15-7"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Neuronal responses to high-frequency stimulation in human subthalamic nucleus.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "15766771", "authors": ["Hashimoto, T", "Goto, T", "Hongo, K"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "While the fundamental and clinical contribution of direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the brain is now well acknowledged, its advantages and limitations have not been re-evaluated for a long time.", "pages": "e15-7"}, {"volume": "72", "title": "Preparing the ethical future of deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "10548667", "authors": ["Bell, E", "Mathieu, G", "Racine, E"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Surgical neurology", "abstract": "Here, we critically review exactly what DES can tell us about cerebral function.", "pages": "e15-7"}, {"volume": "132", "title": "Modulation of fusiform cortex activity by cholinesterase inhibition predicts effects on subsequent memory.", "issue": "Pt 9", "pmid": "10600410", "authors": ["Bentley, P", "Driver, J", "Dolan, RJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "First, we show that DES is highly sensitive for detecting the cortical and axonal eloquent structures.

The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.", "pages": "e15-7"}, {"volume": "1288", "title": "Bilateral high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus normalizes COX activity in the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian rats.", "issue": "", "pmid": "8931597", "authors": ["Vlamings, R", "Visser-Vandewalle, V", "Kozan, R", "Kaplan, S", "Steinbusch, HW", "Temel, Y"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Chronic bilateral subthalamic stimulation (DBS-STN) provides considerable clinical benefits in Parkinson disease patients, with improvement in primary symptoms and resolution of side effects of chronic pharmacological treatment.

However, possible treatment strategies such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS) were less frequently studied in this population. ECT was found to be the most effective treatment procedure for depression of adults. There were only a few double-blind sham (placebo) controlled studies with demonstrated effectiveness of TMS. DBS lacks double-blind studies of this invasive treatment method. ECT seems to be the gold standard for the treatment of resistant patients in this population but the side-effect profile of ECT in this sensitive population will be discussed.

The power of these oscillations is decreased with dopamine agonist administration. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of an electrode implanted in the subthalamic nucleus alters the power of cortical beta and gamma oscillations in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals. These alterations are dependent on stimulation frequency, charge, and amplitude/pulse width. Oscillations were significantly reduced during 200- and 350-Hz stimulation. A minimum charge of 4 nC was required to elicit a reduction in oscillation power. A number of amplitude and pulse width combinations that reached 4 nC were tested; it was found that only the combinations of 33 microA/120 micros and 65 microA/60 micros significantly reduced cortical oscillations. The reduction in beta/gamma oscillation power due to deep brain stimulation (DBS) was consistent with a significant reduction in the animals' rotational behavior, a typical symptom of parkinsonism in the rat. A significant shift from high beta to low gamma was observed in the peak frequencies of ECoG recordings while animals were at rest versus walking on a treadmill. However, DBS exhibited no differential effect on oscillations between these two states.
