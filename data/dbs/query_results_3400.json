To investigate this question, we studied the spontaneous activity of 102 pallidal neurons during GPiDBS in two macaques rendered parkinsonian by administration of MPTP. Stimulation through macroelectrodes in the GPi (> or =200 microA at 150 Hz for 30 s) reduced rigidity in one animal and increased spontaneous movement in both. Novel artifact subtraction methods allowed uninterrupted single-unit recording during stimulation. GPiDBS induced phasic (78% of cells) or sustained (22%) peristimulus changes in firing in both pallidal segments. A subset of cells responded at short latency (<2 ms) in a manner consistent with antidromic driving. Later phasic increases clustered at 3- to 5-ms latency. Stimulation-induced decreases were either phasic, clustered at 1-3 ms, or sustained, showing no peristimulus modulation. Response latency and magnitude often evolved over 30 s of stimulation, but responses were relatively stable by the end of that time. GPiDBS reduced mean firing rates modestly and only in GPi (-6.9 spikes/s). Surprisingly, GPiDBS had no net effect on the prevalence or structure of burst firing. GPiDBS did reduce the prevalence of synchronized low-frequency oscillations. Some cell pairs became synchronized instead at the frequency of stimulation. Suppression of low-frequency oscillations did not require high-frequency synchronization, however, or even the presence of a significant peristimulus response. In summary, the therapeutic effects of GPiDBS may be mediated by an abolition of low-frequency synchronized oscillations as a result of phasic driving.", "pages": "263-6"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus in the parkinsonian primate: local entrainment and suppression of low-frequency oscillations.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "19164104", "authors": ["McCairn, KW", "Turner, RS"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Deep-brain transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) could provide new, non-invasive therapeutic options for various psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Two coil configurations potentially suitable for dTMS are analyzed: circular crown coil and C-core coil. These coils have significantly less attenuation of the electric field strength in depth, compared to conventional TMS coils. In the limiting case as the coil dimensions become large relative to the head, the electric field decay in depth becomes linear, which indicates that, at best, the electric field attenuation is directly proportional to the depth of the target. The charge density and heating induced in the brain are at safe levels, but the risk of unintended neuromodulation and seizures with dTMS has to be evaluated further.

Conference", "abstract": "Primary torsion dystonia (PTD) is a chronic movement disorder manifested clinically by focal or generalized sustained muscle contractions, postures, and/or involuntary movements. The most common inherited form of PTD is associated with the DYT1 mutation on chromosome 9q34. A less frequent form is linked to the DYT6 locus on chromosome 8q21-22. Both forms are autosomal dominant with incomplete (approximately 30%) clinical penetrance. Extensive functional and microstructural imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) has been performed on manifesting and non-manifesting carriers of these mutations. The results are consistent with the view of PTD as a neurodevelopmental circuit disorder involving cortico-striatal-pallido-thalamocortical (CSPTC) and related cerebellar-thalamo-cortical pathways. Studies of resting regional metabolism have revealed consistent abnormalities in PTD involving multiple interconnected elements of these circuits. In gene carriers, changes in specific subsets of these regions have been found to relate to genotype, phenotype, or both. For instance, genotypic abnormalities in striatal metabolic activity parallel previously reported reductions in local D(2) receptor availability. Likewise, we have identified a unique penetrance-related metabolic network characterized by increases in the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) and parietal association areas, associated with relative reductions in the cerebellum, brainstem, and ventral thalamus. Interestingly, metabolic activity in the hypermetabolic areas has recently been found to be modified by the penetrance regulating D216H polymorphism. The DTI data raise the possibility that metabolic abnormalities in mutation carriers reflect adaptive responses to developmental abnormalities in the intrinsic connectivity of the motor pathways. Moreover, findings of increased motor activation responses in these subjects are compatible with the reductions in cortical inhibition that have been observed in this disorder. Future research will focus on clarifying the relationship of these changes to clinical penetrance in dystonia mutation carriers, and the reversibility of disease-related functional abnormalities by treatment.", "pages": "263-6"}, {"volume": "164", "title": "Abnormal structure-function relationships in hereditary dystonia.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18448656", "authors": ["Carbon, M", "Eidelberg, D"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Pain is a well recognized feature of Parkinson disease (PD).

According to animal and human studies, the motor functions of the subthalamic nucleus have been well documented whereas its implication on limbic functions is still less well understood and is only partially explained by anatomical and functional theories of basal ganglia organisation. After chronic subthalamic nucleus stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease, many studies showed executive impairments, apathy, depression, hypomania, and impairment of recognition of negative facial emotions. The medial tip of the subthalamic nucleus represents its limbic part. This part receives inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the limbic part of the striatum (nucleus accumbens), the ventral tegmental area and the limbic ventral pallidum. The medial tip of the subthalamic nucleus projects to the limbic part of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. We propose a new function scheme of the limbic system, establishing connections between limbic cortical structures (medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus) and the limbic part of the basal ganglia. This new circuit could be composed of a minor part based on the model of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, and of a major part linking the subthalamic nucleus with the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway via the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, and with limbic cortical structures.

There was no difference in afferent response magnitude to hypertonic Krebs solution between exercise and na\u00efve groups. In the human study, 13 volunteers participated.

DCN neuronal activity is primarily controlled by GABAergic inhibitory transmission by Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and is also modulated by nerve inputs originating from other brain regions within and outside the cerebellum. In this study, we examined the modulatory effects of 5-HT on GABAergic synapses in the DCN. 5-HT decreased the amplitude of stimulation-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in DCN neurons, and this effect was abolished by a 5-HT(1B) antagonist, SB 224289. The decrease in IPSC amplitude was associated with an increased paired-pulse ratio of the IPSC. 5-HT also decreased the frequency of miniature IPSCs without altering the amplitude. These data suggest that 5-HT presynaptically inhibited GABA release. Furthermore, 5-HT elicited a slow inward current in DCN neurons. Pharmacological studies showed that 5-HT activated the 5-HT(5) receptor, which is positively coupled to G protein and elicited the slow inward current through enhancement of hyperpolarization-activated cation channel activation. Finally, we examined the effects of 5-HT on the spike generation that accompanies repetitive stimulation of inhibitory synapses. 5-HT increased the spontaneous firing rate in DCN neurons caused by depolarization. Increase in the 5-HT-induced tonic firing relatively decreased the contrast difference from the rebound depolarization-induced firing. However, the inhibitory transmission-induced silencing of DCN firing remained during the conditioning stimulus. These results suggest that 5-HT plays a regulatory role in spike generation and contributes to the gain control of inhibitory GABAergic synapses in DCN neurons.", "pages": "263-6"}, {"volume": "72", "title": "Frontal FDG-PET activity correlates with cognitive outcome after STN-DBS in Parkinson disease.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "4997823", "authors": ["Kalbe, E", "Voges, J", "Weber, T", "Haarer, M", "Baudrexel, S", "Klein, JC", "Kessler, J", "Sturm, V", "Heiss, WD", "Hilker, R"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Over the last two decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a recognized and effective clinical therapy for numerous neurological conditions.

Here we test the hypothesis that changes in the functional organization of the motor system involve both cortical and subcortical levels and that these distributed changes are interrelated in defined frequency bands. To this end we evaluated functional connectivity between motor and non-motor cortical sites (fronto-central, parieto-occipital) and the globus pallidus (GP) in human non-REM sleep in seven patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for dystonia using a variety of spectral measures (power, coherence, partial coherence and directed transfer function (DTF)). We found significant coherence between GP and fronto-central cortex as well as between GP and parieto-occipital cortex in circumscribed frequency bands that correlated with sleep specific oscillations in 'light sleep' (N2) and 'slow-wave sleep' (N3). These sleep specific oscillations were also reflected in significant coherence between the two cortical sites corroborating previous studies. Importantly, we found two different physiological activities represented within the broad band of significant coherence between 9.5 and 17 Hz. One component occurred in the frequency range of sleep spindles (12.5-17 Hz) and was maximal in the coherence between fronto-central and parieto-occipital cortex as well as between GP and both cortical sites during N2. This component was still present between fronto-central and parieto-occipital cortex in N3. Functional connectivity in this frequency band may be due to a common input to both GP and cortex. The second component consisted of a spectral peak over 9.5-12.5 Hz. Coherence was elevated in this band for all topographical constellations in both N2 and N3, but especially between GP and fronto-central cortex. The DTF suggested that the 9.5-12.5 Hz activity consisted of a preferential drive from GP to the fronto-central cortex in N2, whereas in N3 the DTF between GP and fronto-central cortex was symmetrical. Partial coherence supported distinctive patterns for the 9.5-12.5 and 12.5 and 17 Hz component, so that only coherence in the 9.5-12.5 Hz band was reduced when the effects of GP were removed from the coherence between the two cortical sites. The data suggest that activities in the GP and fronto-central cortex are functionally connected over 9.5-12.5 Hz, possibly as a specific signature of the motor system in human non-REM sleep.

Early psychosurgical procedures were hazardous and often associated with severe and persistent side effects including avolition, apathy and change of personality. With the introduction of psychopharmacological treatments in the 1950s, the frequency of ablative procedures declined rapidly. The past decade, however, has witnessed the resurgence of surgical strategies as a result of refined techniques and advances such as high frequency stimulation of deep brain nuclei. Recent data suggest that the overall effect of high frequency stimulation lies in the functional inhibition of neural activity in the region stimulated. Contrary to other psychosurgical procedures, high frequency stimulation reversibly modulates targeted brain areas and allows a postsurgical adaption of the stimulation parameters according to clinical outcome. With increased understanding of the brain regions and functional circuits involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, major depression has emerged as a target for new psychosurgical approaches to selectively and precisely modulate neural areas involved in the disease process. Recent studies of minimally intervening procedures report good clinical outcome in the treatment of therapy-resistant forms of major depression. High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas. Nevertheless, the reticence toward psychosurgery, even for those patients suffering from the most debilitating forms of depression, still prevails, even though recent studies have shown significant improvement in terms of quality of life with the limitation that the number of treated cases has been small.

At this time, patients with primary (genetic or sporadic) generalized and segmental dystonia, and patients with (complex) cervical dystonia are thought to be the best candidates for pallidal DBS. Advantages of DBS are its reversibility, its adjustability, and the continuous access to modify the target in the basal ganglia. The present review gives an account on the development of surgical neuromodulation therapy for dystonia, surgical approaches, hardware-related problems, DBS programming and patient management, and clinical outcome. Studies conducted according to the practices of evidence-based medicine confirm the results of early pilot studies. The wide majority of patients achieve beneficial lasting outcome at a relatively low rate of manageable side-effects.

Due to brain shift, the pre- and intra-operative coordinates of anatomic structures are different. When building large population atlases, which rely on pre-operative images for normalization purposes, it is thus necessary to correct for this difference.

We show evidence that electrophysiological maps built using corrected and uncorrected data are different and that the maps created using shift-corrected data correlate better than those created using uncorrected data with the final position of the implant.

The distinct loss of DA neurons in the SN offers the opportunity to assay neuronal cell replacement, and the clinical transplantation of fetal midbrain neuroblasts in PD patients has shown that this approach is feasible. However, there are multiple problems associated with the use of fetus-derived material, including limited availability. DA neurons derived from stem cells (SC) represent an alternative and unlimited cell source for cell replacement therapies.

In this study, the neuroprotective/rescue effects of erythropoietin (EPO), a well known hematopoietic hormone, on dopaminergic neurons were explored with neurogeneic potencies of EPO. EPO (100 IU/day) was continuously administered with micro-osmotic pump for a week to PD model of rats induced by intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection with subsequent behavioral and immunohistochemical investigations. The number of amphetamine-induced rotations of EPO-treated rats significantly decreased, compared to the control rats. The preservation of dopaminergic neurons of EPO-treated rats were confirmed by tyrosine hydroxylase staining and Fluoro-Gold staining. The number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) double positive cells in the subventricular zone of EPO treated rats significantly increased with migratory potencies to the damaged striatum,compared to the control rats. Furthermore, TUNEL staining and phosphorylated Akt staining revealed that the neuroprotective/rescue effects of EPO might be mediated by anti-apoptotic effects through the increase of phosphorylated Akt.

Economical, ethical, scientific and practical issues may on the other hand hamper large animal neuroscience. Large animal neuroscience should therefore either be performed in order to examine large animal species dependent problems or to complement promising small animal basic studies by constituting an intermediate research system, bridging small animal CNS research to the human CNS. We have, accordingly, during the last ten years used the Gottingen minipig to examine neuromodulatory treatment modalities such as stem cell transplantation and deep brain stimulation directed towards Parkinson disease. This has been accomplished by the development of a MPTP-based large animal model of Parkinson disease in the Gottingen minipig and the development of stereotaxic and surgical approaches needed to manipulate the Gottingen minipig CNS. The instituted changes in the CNS can be evaluated in the live animal by brain imaging (PET and MR), cystometry, gait analysis, neurological evaluation and by post mortem examination based on histology and stereological analysis.", "pages": "263-6"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Identification of the pyramidal tract by neuronavigation based on intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging combined with subcortical stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17344390", "authors": ["Ozawa, N", "Muragaki, Y", "Nakamura, R", "Iseki, H"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "Gait freezing and poor balance are two of the most disabling symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), and also of other untreatable progressive neurological disorders, such as multi-system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In PD, these symptoms are currently inadequately managed by drugs and also the present surgical treatment of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi). The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has been implicated in these symptoms. The PPN is in the upper brain stem. The major inhibitory input is from the GPi and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), and bilateral output is to the substantia nigra compacta (SNc), thalamus and spinal cord. Stimulation of the PPN in the decerebrate rat, cat and dog induced gait-like movements. In autopsy studies in PD, MSA, PSP and the DYT-1 dystonic brain, the PPN is degenerate. Autoradiography of the MPTP-Parkinsonian primate shows excessive inhibition in the PPN. Lesions of the PPN in the normal primate induced PD-type bradykinesia, which was persistent with bilateral lesions. In the MPTP-primate model, microinjections of the gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABA) antagonist bicuculine into the PPN reversed Parkinsonian akinesia implying that stimulation of this region might have a therapeutic role in drug resistant PD. Low frequency (5-10Hz) stimulation of the PPN in the same model reversed akinesia independently of L-dopa; moreover, l-dopa and stimulation effects were additive, implying the involvement of non-dopaminergic pathways.", "pages": "263-6"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Long-term efficacy and safety of chronic globus pallidus internus stimulation in different types of primary dystonia.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17432724", "authors": ["Mehrkens, JH", "B\u00f6tzel, K", "Steude, U", "Zeitler, K", "Schnitzler, A", "Sturm, V", "Voges, J"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "There is a need for acute and chronic stimulation of the brain within the MRI for studies of epilepsy, as well as deep brain stimulation for movement and behavioral disorders.

To explore the effect of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on postural stability and gait, full body gait analyses were performed without medication, OFF and ON DBS in eight PD patients and 12 healthy age-matched controls. DBS setting was changed at least 3 hours before gait analysis. To describe asymmetry most and least affected sides (MAS and LAS) were rated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor part and quantitative gait analysis with the Vicon 612 gait analysis system. Stride length and gait velocity but not cadence improved ON DBS. The distances between the heel markers and center of mass (COM) were asymmetric and reduced OFF DBS. STN DBS increased the distances significantly and reduced asymmetry. The improvement in heel to COM distance was larger on the MAS compared with the LAS. OFF DBS knee momentum asymmetry was inversed so that LAS was more impaired than MAS. ON DBS asymmetry improved. PD patients OFF DBS place the heel too close to COM. The most affected body side has the most impaired swing and the result is a smaller knee moment on the opposite and least affected body side and an asymmetric gait pattern with disturbed balance OFF STN DBS. The asymmetry OFF DBS improved ON DBS. We suggest that DBS facilitates symmetric gait and thereby improves balance during gait.", "pages": "263-6"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "Development of a rat model of photothrombotic ischemia and infarction within the caudoputamen.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19163989", "authors": ["Kuroiwa, T", "Xi, G", "Hua, Y", "Nagaraja, TN", "Fenstermacher, JD", "Keep, RF"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), but the medication requirements after implant are poorly known.

We measured, during the entire observation period, the effect of deep brain stimulation on motor and functional outcome measures, the levodopa equivalent daily dose and the total electrical energy delivered. At 5 years, the UPDRS motor score had improved by 54.2% and levodopa equivalent dose was reduced by 61.9%, compared with preimplant. Dopaminergic medication remained stable during the observation period, but energy was progressively increased over time. Rest tremor, rigidity, gait, lower and upper limb akinesia, and total axial score were improved in decreasing order. Postural stability and speech improved transiently, whereas on-period freezing of gait, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias recovered durably. Functional measures did not show improvement in autonomy and daily living activities after STN implant. Chronic STN stimulation allows to replace for dopaminergic medications in the long-term at the expense of an increase of the total energy delivered.
