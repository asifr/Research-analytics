The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on gastric emptying. A total of 16 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation were enrolled. Gastric emptying was expressed as the peak time of (13)CO(2) excretion (T(max)) in the (13)C-acetate breath test and was assessed in patients with and without administration of 100-150\u2009mg levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor before surgery, and with and without subthalamic deep brain stimulation at 3 months post-surgery. The pattern of (13)CO(2) excretion curve was analysed. To evaluate potential factors related to the effect of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on gastric emptying, we also examined the association between gastric emptying, clinical characteristics, the equivalent dose of levodopa and serum ghrelin levels. The peak time of (13)CO(2) excretion (T(max)) values for gastric emptying in patients without and with levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor treatment were 45.6\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009min and 42.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.6\u2009min, respectively (P\u2009=\u2009not significant), thus demonstrating levodopa resistance. The peak time of (13)CO(2) excretion (T(max)) values without and with subthalamic deep brain stimulation after surgery were 44.0\u2009\u00b1\u200917.5\u2009min and 30.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\u2009min (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively, which showed that subthalamic deep brain stimulation was effective. Simultaneously, the pattern of the (13)CO(2) excretion curve was also significantly improved relative to surgery with no stimulation (P\u2009=\u20090.002), although the difference with and without levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor was not significant. The difference in peak time of (13)CO(2) excretion (T(max)) values without levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor before surgery and without levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor and subthalamic deep brain stimulation after surgery was not significant, although motor dysfunction improved and the levodopa equivalent dose decreased after surgery. There was little association between changes in ghrelin levels (\u0394ghrelin) and changes in T(max) values (\u0394T(max)) in the subthalamic deep brain stimulation trial after surgery (r\u2009=\u2009-0.20), and no association between changes in other characteristics and \u0394T(max) post-surgery in the subthalamic deep brain stimulation trial. These results showed that levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor did not influence gastric emptying and that subthalamic deep brain stimulation can improve the dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease possibly by altering the neural system that controls gastrointestinal function after subthalamic deep brain stimulation.

Here, we investigated the relationship between the anatomical site of stimulation within the MRI-defined STN and the outcome of PD patients after STN-HFS. In 30 PD patients with bilateral STN stimulation, we retrospectively defined the boundaries of the STN within the axial target plane of the stereotactic T2-weighted MRI and determined the position of the active electrode contact in relation to the border of the STN. The position of the active contact within the STN was the only variable to predict the outcome of STN stimulation. In contrast, covariates such as age, disease duration, symptom severity, and response to levodopa had no effect. The lateral position of the stimulation contact within the STN led to significantly better clinical improvement, lower stimulation parameters, and less need for postoperative dopaminergic medication.

Behavioral outcomes of DBS were then coupled with detailed, subject-specific computational models of neurons in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), globus pallidus externus (GPe), and internal capsule (IC) to determine which neuronal pathways when modulated with high-frequency electrical stimulation best correlate with improvement in motor symptoms. The modeling results support the hypothesis that multiple neuronal pathways can underlie the therapeutic effect of DBS on parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity. Across all three subjects, improvements in rigidity correlated most strongly with spread of neuronal activation into IC, driving a small percentage of fibers within this tract (<10% on average). The most robust effect on bradykinesia resulted from stimulating a combination of sensorimotor axonal projections within the GP, specifically at the site of the medial medullary lamina.

Since the mechanisms of action of DBS remain unclear, programming sessions can be time consuming, costly and result in sub-optimal outcomes. Measurement of electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) during DBS, generated by activated neurons in the vicinity of the stimulating electrode, could offer insight into the type and spatial extent of neural element activation and provide a potential feedback signal for the rational selection of stimulation parameters and closed-loop DBS. However, recording ECAPs presents a significant technical challenge due to the large stimulus artefact, which can saturate recording amplifiers and distort short latency ECAP signals. We developed DBS-ECAP recording instrumentation combining commercial amplifiers and circuit elements in a serial configuration to reduce the stimulus artefact and enable high fidelity recording. We used an electrical circuit equivalent model of the instrumentation to understand better the sources of the stimulus artefact and the mechanisms of artefact reduction by the circuit elements. In vitro testing validated the capability of the instrumentation to suppress the stimulus artefact and increase gain by a factor of 1000 to 5000 compared to a conventional biopotential amplifier. The distortion of mock ECAP (mECAP) signals was measured across stimulation parameters, and the instrumentation enabled high fidelity recording of mECAPs with latencies of only 0.5 ms for DBS pulse widths of 50 to 100 \u00b5s/phase. Subsequently, the instrumentation was used to record in vivo ECAPs, without contamination by the stimulus artefact, during thalamic DBS in an anesthetized cat. The characteristics of the physiological ECAP were dependent on stimulation parameters. The novel instrumentation enables high fidelity ECAP recording and advances the potential use of the ECAP as a feedback signal for the tuning of DBS parameters.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "Long-term effects of nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation in treatment-resistant depression: evidence for sustained efficacy.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "8413464", "authors": ["Bewernick, BH", "Kayser, S", "Sturm, V", "Schlaepfer, TE"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Associative learning is required for face-name association and is impaired in alcoholism, but the cognitive processes and brain structural components underlying this deficit remain unclear.

They encompass impulse control disorders, punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. A relationship with dopaminergic treatment is strongly suggested. Subthalamic stimulation improves motor complications and allows for drastic reductions in medication. This treatment might, therefore, be considered for patients with behavioural addictions, when attempts to reduce dopaminergic medication have failed. However, conflicting data have reported suppression, alleviation, worsening or new onset of behavioural addictions after subthalamic stimulation. Non-motor fluctuations are also a disabling feature of the disease. We prospectively investigated behaviour in a cohort of 63 patients with Parkinson's disease, before and 1 year after subthalamic stimulation using the Ardouin scale, with systematic evaluation of functioning in overall appetitive or apathetic modes, non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, as well as behavioural addictions (including impulse control disorders and punding) and compulsive use of dopaminergic medication. Defined drug management included immediate postoperative discontinuation of dopamine agonists and reduction in levodopa. Motor and cognitive statuses were controlled (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, frontal score). After surgery, the OFF medication motor score improved (-45.2%), allowing for a 73% reduction in dopaminergic treatment, while overall cognitive evaluation was unchanged. Preoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome had disappeared in 4/4, behavioural addictions in 17/17 and compulsive dopaminergic medication use in 9/9 patients. New onset of levodopa abuse occurred in one patient with surgical failure. Non-motor fluctuations were significantly reduced with improvements in off-dysphoria (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) and reduction in on-euphoria (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). There was an inversion in the number of patients functioning in an overall appetitive mode (29 before versus 2 after surgery, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001) to an overall apathetic mode (3 before versus 13 after surgery, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Two patients attempted suicide. Improvement in motor fluctuations is linked to the direct effect of stimulation on the sensory-motor subthalamic territory, while improvement in dyskinesias is mainly explained by an indirect effect related to the decrease in dopaminergic drugs. Our data suggest that non-motor fluctuations could similarly be directly alleviated through stimulation of the non-motor subthalamic territories, and hyperdopaminergic side effects might improve mainly due to the decrease in dopaminergic medication. We show an overall improvement in neuropsychiatric symptomatology and propose that disabling non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic treatment abuse and drug-induced behavioural addictions in Parkinson's disease may be considered as new indications for subthalamic stimulation.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Deep brain stimulation in disabling involuntary vocalization associated with Huntington's disease.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "7584993", "authors": ["Garcia-Ruiz, PJ", "Ayerbe, J", "del Val, J", "Herranz, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "Though microelectrode recordings likely increase the risks and costs of DBS, incremental improvement in accuracy may translate into improved outcomes that justify these risks and costs.

In 70% of cases, the imaging-based trajectories corresponded to the physiologically defined optimal target. For the remaining 30% of cases, 70% required only a single additional MER tract.

The image protocol was optimized through both simulation and in vivo experiments to obtain the best image quality. Taking advantage of the multiple echoes and high readout bandwidths, no interimage registration is required since all images are produced in one acquisition, and image distortion and chemical shift are reduced.

Classical theories hold that separate sets of brain regions are responsible for selecting and implementing an action. Traditionally, action selection has been considered the domain of high-level regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, whereas action generation is thought to be carried out by dedicated cortical and subcortical motor regions. However, increasing evidence suggests that the activity of individual neurons in cortical motor structures reflects abstract properties of \"decision variables\" rather than conveying simple motor commands. Less is known, though, about the role of subcortical structures in decision making. In particular, the superior colliculus (SC) is critical for planning and initiating visually guided, gaze-displacing movements and selecting visual targets, but whether and how it contributes more generally to sensorimotor decisions are unclear. Here, we show that the SC is intimately involved in orienting decisions based on odor cues, even though the SC does not explicitly process olfactory stimuli. Neurons were recorded from the intermediate and deep SC layers in rats trained to perform a delayed-response, odor-cued spatial choice task. SC neurons commonly fired well in advance of movement initiation, predicting the chosen direction nearly 1 s before movement. Moreover, under conditions of sensory uncertainty, SC activity varied with task difficulty and reward outcome, reflecting the influence of decision variables on the intercollicular competition thought to underlie orienting movements. These results indicate that the SC plays a more general role in decisions than previously appreciated, extending beyond visuomotor functions.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Mood response to deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9399206", "authors": ["Campbell, MC", "Black, KJ", "Weaver, PM", "Lugar, HM", "Videen, TO", "Tabbal, SD", "Karimi, M", "Perlmutter, JS", "Hershey, T"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences", "abstract": "\u2002 Nonpulsatile tinnitus is an auditory phantom percept characterized as a tone, or a noise-like sound such as a hissing or buzzing sound or polyphonic, in the absence of any objective physical sound source.

It was reported earlier that auditory stimuli produce bilateral activation in auditory cortex, thalamus, and caudate during both wakefulness and NREM sleep. However, due to the spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations cortical responses may be highly variable during NREM. Here we now examine the modulation of cerebral responses to tones depending on the presence or absence of sleep spindles and the phase of the slow oscillation. Thirteen healthy young subjects were scanned successfully during stage 2-4 NREM sleep in the first half of the night in a 3\u2009T scanner. Subjects were not sleep-deprived and sounds were post hoc classified according to (i) the presence of sleep spindles or (ii) the phase of the slow oscillation during (\u00b1300\u2009ms) tone delivery. These detected sounds were then entered as regressors of interest in fMRI analyses. Interestingly wake-like responses - although somewhat altered in size and location - persisted during NREM sleep, except during present spindles (as previously published in Dang-Vu et al., 2011) and the negative going phase of the slow oscillation during which responses became less consistent or even absent. While the phase of the slow oscillation did not alter brain responses in primary sensory cortex, it did modulate responses at higher cortical levels. In addition EEG analyses show a distinct N550 response to tones during the presence of light sleep spindles and suggest that in deep NREM sleep the brain is more responsive during the positive going slope of the slow oscillation. The presence of short temporal windows during which the brain is open to external stimuli is consistent with the fact that even during deep sleep meaningful events can be detected. Altogether, our results emphasize the notion that spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity profoundly modify brain responses to external information across all behavioral states, including deep NREM sleep.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "61", "title": "Is optical imaging spectroscopy a viable measurement technique for the investigation of the negative BOLD phenomenon?

Here, we discuss common clinical and investigational methods of neuromodulation. Compared to clinical spinal cord stimulation (SCS), investigational techniques of cerebral neuromodulation, both invasive (deep brain stimulation [DBS] and motor cortical stimulation [MCS]) and noninvasive (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS] and transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]), may be more advantageous. By adaptively targeting the multidimensional experience of pain, subtended by integrative pain circuitry in the brain, including somatosensory and thalamocortical, limbic and cognitive, cerebral methods may modulate the sensory-discriminative, affective-emotional and evaluative-cognitive spheres of the pain neuromatrix. Despite promise, the current state of results alludes to the possibility that cerebral neuromodulation has thus far not been effective in producing analgesia as intended in patients with chronic pain disorders.

Increasing disability and impaired activities of daily living concomitantly raise indirect costs, due to loss in productivity. Hence, the economic burden of advanced PD is substantial for both the society and the patients with their caregivers.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Technical advances in deep brain stimulation: how far is enough?", "issue": "3", "pmid": "21572395", "authors": ["Alegre, M", "Hallett, M", "Olanow, CW", "Obeso, JA"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "A systematic literature search was performed involving the databases NHS CRD (National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and PubMed until July 15, 2011. \"Parkinson\" [Mesh] and \"cost\" were used as search terms in PubMed and only \"Parkinson\" in the CRD database.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "73", "title": "Autonomic failure following deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20470774", "authors": ["Williams, SE", "Ernst, T", "Birns, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)", "abstract": "Economic evaluations are scarce and heterogeneous, and their interpretation may be limited due to methodological shortcomings.

Eleven patients were stimulated with DBS bilateral to the NAcc. Main outcome measures were clinical effect (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asperg Rating Scale of Depression, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale) QoL (SF-36), cognition and safety at baseline, 12 months (n=11), 24 months (n=10), and last follow-up (maximum 4 years, n=5). Analyses were performed in an intent-to-treat method with last observation carried forward, thus 11 patients contributed to each point in time. In all, 5 of 11 patients (45%) were classified as responders after 12 months and remained sustained responders without worsening of symptoms until last follow-up after 4 years. Both ratings of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the sample as a whole from first month of NAcc-DBS on. All patients improved in QoL measures. One non-responder committed suicide. No severe adverse events related to parameter change were reported. First-time, preliminary long-term data on NAcc-DBS have demonstrated a stable antidepressant and anxiolytic effect and an amelioration of QoL in this small sample of patients suffering from TRD.

In OCD, DBS is now an alternative procedure to lesions of fascicles such as the anterior capsule, which links the orbitofrontal cortex, the cingulum, and the thalamus, and has been applied to new target such as the nucleus accumbens, with promising results. However, a recent interest has been developed toward the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a key structure of the basal ganglia that connects the motor, limbic, and associative systems. It is known from patients with Parkinson disease that STN-DBS can have significant effects on mood and cognition. Those transient effects are usually seen as \"side effects\" in Parkinson disease, but are clues to the underappreciated role that STN plays in the limbic circuitry, a role whose precise details are as yet unknown and under active investigation. We present the rationale supporting the use of nonmotor STN as a therapeutic target to treat OCD.

With this followed the publication of a number of stereotactic frames and atlases. The intercommissural line joining the anterior and posterior commissures was to define stereotactic coordinate systems used in movement disorders and other functional neurosurgical procedures. Initially the target for Parkinson disease was the globus pallidus internus (GPi), but many investigators soon turned to the thalamus or parts of the subthalamus, but not the subthalamic nucleus. Microelectrode recording was introduced in 1961. With the apparent clinical efficacy of L-DOPA in 1965 interest in stereotactic surgery for Parkinson disease declined. The failure of prolonged, consistent pharmacologic management of bradykinesia and tremor, the side effects of dyskinesias, and the fading therapeutic success of medical treatment of movement disorders led to a resurgence of interest in the surgical management of movement disorders. With advances in understanding of the functional anatomy of the corticobasal ganglia circuit, advances in brain imaging, more sophisticated electrophysiologic recordings, and the use of deep brain stimulation as a reversible lesion, stereotactic surgery returned as a viable option for the treatment of movement disorders. The posterior medial part of the globus pallidus, ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus, and the subthalamus, its nuclei and pathways, are sites for interrupting pathophysiologic circuits. Not only has this been applied to movement disorders, but to epilepsy, chronic pain, and behavioral disorders.", "pages": "15"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Unilateral deep brain stimulation of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus improves oromotor movements in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "21725324", "authors": ["Mazzone, P", "Padua, L", "Falisi, G", "Insola, A", "Florio, TM", "Scarnati, E"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Brain stimulation", "abstract": "Surgery in psychiatric disorders has a long history and has regained momentum in the past few decades with deep brain stimulation (DBS).

Open trials have shown encouraging results with DBS for therapy-refractory depression and case reports have shown potential effects of DBS on addiction. Another promising indication is Tourette syndrome, where potential efficacy of DBS is shown by several case series and a few controlled trials.

However, the mechanisms of action of HF-DBS remain poorly understood. Herein we present a review of the literature and our current view of the question. The first part deals with the effects of stimulation itself on the different parts of the neuron and tries to answer the question of what is actually stimulated by DBS (cell bodies, dendrites or axons). The second part is devoted to the ortho- and antidromic effects of the stimulation. The third part more specifically focuses on the case of subthalamic nucleus stimulation. The target axons in the subthalamic area are discussed in the light of recent optogenetic studies. In conclusion, HF-DBS leads to a kind of functional deafferentation of the stimulated structure and to the modulation of cortical activity (both ortho and antidromically). Which effects are relevant to the therapeutic effects of DBS is still unclear.

Treatment options for PLP are to a large degree implicated by the level of understanding the mechanisms and nature of PLP. Research and clinical findings acknowledge the neuropathic nature of PLP and also suggest that both peripheral as well as central mechanisms, including neuroplastic changes in central nervous system, can contribute to PLP. Neuroimaging studies in PLP have indicated a relation between PLP and the neuroplastic changes. Further, it has been shown that the pathological neuroplastic changes could be reverted, and there is a parallel between an improvement (reversal) of the neuroplastic changes in PLP and pain relief. These findings facilitated explorations of novel neuromodulatory treatment strategies, adding to the variety of treatment approaches in PLP. Overall, available treatment options in PLP include pharmacological treatment, supportive non-pharmacological non-invasive strategies (eg, neuromodulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation, visual feedback therapy, or motor imagery; peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, physical therapy, reflexology, or various psychotherapeutic approaches), and invasive treatment strategies (eg, surgical destructive procedures, nerve blocks, or invasive neuromodulation using deep brain stimulation, motor cortex stimulation, or spinal cord stimulation). Venues of further development in PLP management include a technological and methodological improvement of existing treatment methods, an implementation of new techniques and products, and a development of new treatment approaches.", "pages": "15"}]
