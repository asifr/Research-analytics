The perirhinal cortex (PRC) represents one of the main conduits for the bi-directional flow of information between the entorhinal-hippocampal network and the cortical mantle, a process essential in memory formation. However, despite anatomical evidence for a robust reciprocal connectivity between the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, neurophysiological understanding of this circuitry is lacking. We now present the results of a series of electrophysiological experiments in rats that demonstrate robust synaptic activation patterns of the perirhinal-entorhinal inter-connections. First, using silicon multi-electrode arrays placed under visual guidance in vivo we performed current source density (CSD) analysis of lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) responses to PRC stimulation, which demonstrated a current sink in layers II-III of the LEC with a latency consistent with monosynaptic activation. To further substantiate and extend this conclusion, we developed a PRC-LEC slice preparation where CSD analysis also revealed a current sink in superficial LEC layers in response to PRC stimulation. Importantly, intracellular recording of superficial LEC layer neurons confirmed that they receive a major monosynaptic excitatory input from the PRC. Finally, CSD analysis of the LEC to PRC projection in vivo also allowed us to document robust feedback synaptic activation of PRC neurons to deep LEC layer activation. We conclude that a clear bidirectional pattern of synaptic interactions exists between the PRC and LEC that would support a dynamic flow of information subserving memory function in the temporal lobe.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Functional neuroimaging of headaches.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "15488457", "authors": ["S\u00e1nchez del Rio, M", "Alvarez Linera, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging, mainly PET and functional MRI, is the main tool that allows the capturing of neurovascular events during a headache attack.

In the present study, the authors tested the hypothesis that DBS of the ventral caudate nucleus might be effective in a patient with intractable severe OCD and concomitant major depression. Psychiatric assessment included the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale for determining the symptom severity of OCD, depression, and anxiety as well as the quality of pychosocial and occupational functioning, respectively. Neuropsychological assessment consisted of a wide range of tests primarily exploring memory and executive functions. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral caudate nucleus markedly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety until their remission, which was achieved at 6 months after the start of stimulation (HDRS < or = 7 and HARS < or = 10). Remission of OCD (Y-BOCS < 16) was also delayed after 12 or 15 months of DBS. The level of functioning pursuant to the GAF scale progressively increased during the 15-month follow-up period.

The aim of the present human study was to assess the non-painful and painful pressure sensitivity with (1) anaesthetised skin, and (2) anaesthetised skin combined with a block of large diameter muscle afferents. The skin was anaesthetised by a topically applied anaesthetic cream and later lidocaine was administrated subcutaneously. The pressure sensitivity was assessed quantitatively by computer-controlled pressure stimulation on the anterior tibial muscle. Thresholds to detection, pain and pain tolerance were assessed. In the first experiment, computer-controlled needle insertion depths evoking touch and pain sensations were used to assess the efficacy of cutaneous anaesthesia. Touch and pain sensations evoked during needle insertions were found to be superficial in intact skin but when anaesthetised, touch sensation was occasionally evoked at depths related to penetration of the fascia. With the skin completely anaesthetised to brush and von Frey hair pinprick stimulation, skin indentation with the strongest von Frey hair caused a sensation described as a deep touch sensation. Simultaneously, pressure detection and pain thresholds increased but it was still possible to elicit non-painful and painful pressure sensation in all subjects. In a second experiment, a differential nerve block of group I and II afferent fibres was obtained by full-leg ischaemia simultaneously with cutaneous anaesthesia. The efficacy of the tourniquet block was continuously assessed by a battery of somatosensory tests (heat, brush, vibration, electrical and movement detection) applied at the foot simultaneously with pressure stimulation on the anterior tibial muscle. After 20 min of ischaemia, group II afferent fibres mediating the sensations of movement detection, vibration and brush on the foot was blocked but the heat pain threshold was not affected. In this condition (anaesthetised skin and block of group I and II fibres from deep tissue) a pressure sensation was evoked in 70% of subjects although the pressure detection threshold was increased. The pressure pain sensitivity was decreased, which, however, might indicate a partial block of group III and IV muscle afferents. In a third experiment, the tactile sensations elicited by electrical stimulation of the tibialis anterior muscle and skin at the lower leg were significantly decreased after 20 min of ischaemia, validating the blocking effects of group I and II nerve fibres. The present data show a marginal contribution of cutaneous afferents to the pressure pain sensation that, however, is relatively more dependent on contributions from deep tissue group III and IV afferents. Moreover, a pressure sensation can be elicited from deep tissue probably mediated by group III and IV afferents involving low-threshold mechanoreceptors.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "159", "title": "Painful and non-painful pressure sensations from human skeletal muscle.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15481726", "authors": ["Graven-Nielsen, T", "Mense, S", "Arendt-Nielsen, L"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Research in animals suggests that the cerebral cortex plays an important role in regulating the activity of the STN but this control is not known in humans. The most extensive cortical innervation of the STN originates from motor areas. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during intraoperative single-unit recordings from STN, in six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulators, to determine whether TMS of the motor cortex (MC) modulates the activity of STN and to investigate in vivo the functional organization of the corticosubthalamic circuit in the human brain. Single-pulse TMS of the MC induced an excitation in 74.9% of neurons investigated. This activation was followed by a long-lasting inhibition of the STN neuronal activity that did not correlate with PD severity. Responsive neurons to TMS of the hand area of motor cortex were located mainly in the lateral and dorsal region of the subthalamus while unresponsive cells had a prevalently medial distribution.

The STN rest electrical activity in Parkinson's disease, however, is still unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that pharmacological modulation of STN activity has rhythm-specific effects in the classical range of EEG frequencies, below 50 Hz. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) through electrodes implanted in the STN of patients with Parkinson's disease (20 nuclei from 13 patients). After overnight withdrawal of antiparkinsonian therapy, LFPs were recorded at rest both before (off) and after (on) acute administration of different antiparkinsonian drugs: levodopa, apomorphine, or orphenadrine. In the off-state, STN LFPs showed clearly defined peaks of oscillatory activity below 50 Hz: at low frequencies (2-7 Hz), in the alpha (7-13 Hz), low-beta (13-20 Hz), and high-beta range (20-30 Hz). In the on-state after levodopa and apomorphine administration, low-beta activity significantly decreased and low-frequency activity increased. In contrast, orphenadrine increased beta activity. Power changes elicited by levodopa and apomorphine at low frequencies and in the beta range were not correlated, whereas changes in the alpha band, which were globally not significant, correlated with the beta rhythm (namely, low beta: 13-20 Hz). In conclusion, in the human STN, there are at least two rhythms below 50 Hz that are separately modulated by antiparkinsonian medication: one at low frequencies and one in the beta range. Multiple rhythms are consistent with the hypothesis of multiple oscillating systems, each possibly correlating with specific aspects of human STN function and dysfunction.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Quantifying motion in dystonic syndromes: the bare essentials.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "12542386", "authors": ["Liepert, J", "Kucinski, T", "T\u00fcscher, O", "Pawlas, F", "B\u00e4umer, T", "Weiller, C"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Olfactory information is central for memory-related functions, such as recognition and spatial orientation. To understand the role of olfaction in learning and memory, the distribution and propagation of olfactory tract-driven activity in the parahippocampal region needs to be characterized. We recently demonstrated that repetitive stimulation of the olfactory tract in the isolated guinea pig brain preparation induces an early direct activation of the rostrolateral entorhinal region followed by a delayed response in the medial entorhinal cortex (EC), preceded by the interposed activation of the hippocampus. In the present study we performed a detailed topographic analysis of both the early and the delayed entorhinal responses induced by patterned stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract in the isolated guinea pig brain. Bi-dimensional maps of EC activity recorded at 128 recording sites with 4 x 4 matrix electrodes (410 microm interlead separation) sequentially placed in eight different positions, showed (i) an early (onset at 16.09 +/- 1.2 ms) low amplitude potential mediated by the monosynaptic LOT input, followed by (ii) an associative potential in the rostral EC which originates from the piriform cortex (onset at 33.2 +/- 2.3 ms), and (iii) a delayed potential dependent on the previous activation of the hippocampus. The sharp component of the delayed response had an onset latency between 52 and 63 ms and was followed by a slow wave. Laminar profile analysis demonstrated that in the caudomedial EC the delayed response was associated with two distinct current sinks located in deep and in superficial layers, whereas in the rostrolateral EC a small-amplitude sink could be detected in the superficial layers exclusively. The present report demonstrates that the output generated by the hippocampal activation is unevenly distributed across different EC subregions and indicates that exclusively the medial and caudal divisions receive a deep-layer input from the hippocampus. In the rostrolateral EC, specific network interactions may be generated by the convergence of the direct olfactory input and the olfaction-driven hippocampal output.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "35", "title": "Motor cortex excitability after cerebellar infarction.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "12648767", "authors": ["Metman, LV", "Myre, B", "Verwey, N", "Hassin-Baer, S", "Arzbaecher, J", "Sierens, D", "Bakay, R"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation", "abstract": "To evaluate the long term (4 years) efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in advanced Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Test-retest reliability of UPDRS-III, dyskinesia scales, and timed motor tests in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease: an argument against multiple baseline assessments.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "12659437", "authors": ["Herzog, J", "Fietzek, U", "Hamel, W", "Morsnowski, A", "Steigerwald, F", "Schrader, B", "Weinert, D", "Pfister, G", "M\u00fcller, D", "Mehdorn, HM", "Deuschl, G", "Volkmann, J"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "We performed a double blind crossover evaluation of the efficacy of DBS of the STN in the \"off\" medication condition in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease.

The examined cortical region was adjacent to the caudodorsal border (4.8-7.0 mm posterior to bregma) of the primary auditory area (area Te1) and exhibited relatively late auditory response and high best frequency, compared with the caudal end of area Te1. On the basis of the location and auditory response property, the cortical region is considered identical to \"posterodorsal\" auditory area (PD). Injections of biocytin in PD revealed characteristic projections, which terminated in cortical areas and subcortical structures that play pivotal roles in directed attention and space processing. The most noticeable cortical terminal field appeared as dense plexuses of axons in area Oc2M, the posterior parietal cortex. Small terminal fields were scattered in area frontal cortex, area 2 that comprises the frontal eye field. The subcortical terminal fields were observed in the pontine nucleus, the nucleus of the brachium inferior colliculus, and the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus. Corticostriatal projections targeted two discrete regions of the caudate putamen: the top of the middle part and the caudal end.

Cues prompted covert orienting of spatial attention under voluntary control to either a left or right visual field position. Targets were flashed subsequently at the cued or uncued location, or bilaterally. Following rTMS over right dorsal PPC, (i) the benefit for target detection at cued versus uncued positions was preserved irrespective of cueing direction (left- or rightward), but (ii) leftward cueing was associated with a global impairment in target detection, at all target locations. This reveals that leftward orienting was still possible after right dorsal PPC stimulation, albeit at an increased overall cost for target detection. In addition, rTMS (iii) impaired left, but (iv) enhanced right target detection after rightward cueing. The finding of a global drop in target detection during leftward orienting with a spared, relative detection benefit at the cued (left) location (i-ii) suggests that right dorsal PPC plays a subsidiary rather than pivotal role in voluntary spatial orienting. This finding reconciles seemingly conflicting results from patients and neuroimaging studies.

There have been no similar histopathological studies on brains from dystonic patients who have undergone DBS.

We hoped that by examining explanted DBS electrodes using scanning (SEM) and/or transmission (TEM) electron microscopy we might visualize any attached tissue and thus understand the electrode-human brain tissue interaction more accurately. Initially, SEM was performed on one control DBS electrode that had not been implanted. Then 21 (one subthalamic nucleus and 20 globus pallidus internus) explanted DBS electrodes were prepared, after fixation in 3% glutaraldehyde, for SEM (n = 9) or TEM (n = 10), or both (n = 2), according to departmental protocol.

The presence of mononuclear macrophages containing lysosomes and sometimes having conspicuous filopodia was detected by TEM. Both types of cell contained highly electron-dense inclusions, which probably represent phagocytosed material. Similar material, the exact nature of which is unknown, was also seen in the vicinity of these cells. This reaction was present irrespective of the duration of implantation and may be a response to the polyurethane component of the electrodes' surface coat.

We studied seven patients who underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode implantation in the thalamus for treatment of tremor (six patients) and myoclonus-dystonia (one patient). We recorded from the DBS contacts and scalp simultaneously, while patients performed self-paced wrist extension movements. Post-surgical MRI was used for precise localization of the DBS contacts in six patients.

Since patients receive HFS for many years, animal studies which reproduce the conditions of long-term stimulation will be necessary to accurately investigate the effects of HFS. However, stimulation parameters of acute HFS cannot be easily transferred to long-term conditions. Accordingly, for this purpose we studied the influence of different charge densities (0, 3, 6.5, 13 and 26 microC/cm2/phase) and duration (4 h or 3 days) of subthalamic nucleus (STN)-HFS using stainless-steel and platinum-iridium (Pt/Ir) electrodes on neuronal tissue damage in rats. Our data demonstrate the advantage of Pt/Ir over stainless-steel electrodes when used in short-term HFS (frequency 130 Hz, pulse width 60 micros) and indicate that HFS using Pt/Ir-electrodes pulsed with 3 microC/cm2/phase over 3 days did not produce any relevant tissue damage in the STN.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "148", "title": "[Manipulation of mental competence: an ethical problem in case of electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for severe Parkinson's disease].", "issue": "28", "pmid": "19471542", "authors": ["Berghmans, RL", "De Wert, GM"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde", "abstract": "Dysarthria in Parkinson's disease can be characterised by monotony of pitch and loudness, reduced stress, variable rate, imprecise consonants, and a breathy and harsh voice.

Traditional speech therapy can lead to improvement of dysarthria, and intensive programmes have had substantial beneficial effects on vocal loudness. Unilateral surgical lesions of subcortical structures are variably effective for the alleviation of dysarthria, whereas bilateral procedures typically lead to worsening of speech production. Among deep-brain stimulation procedures, only stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus improves some motor components of speech although intelligibility seems to decrease after surgery.

It is associated with minimal morbidity. The rationale of targeting specific structures within basal ganglia such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is strongly supported by the current knowledge of the basal ganglia pathophysiology, which is derived from extensive experimental work and which provides the theoretical basis for surgical therapy in PD. In particular, the STN has advanced to the worldwide most used target for DBS in the treatment of PD, due to the marked improvement of all cardinal symptoms of the disease. Moreover on-period dyskinesias are reduced in parallel with a marked reduction of the equivalent daily levodopa dose following STN-DBS. The success of the therapy largely depends on the selection of the appropriate candidate patients and on the precise implantation of the stimulation electrode, which necessitates careful imaging-based pre-targeting and extensive electrophysiological exploration of the target area. Despite the clinical success of the therapy, the fundamental mechanisms of high-frequency stimulation are still not fully elucidated. There is a large amount of evidence from experimental and clinical data that stimulation frequency represents a key factor with respect to clinical effect of DBS. Interestingly, high-frequency stimulation mimics the functional effects of ablation in various brain structures. The main hypotheses for the mechanism of high-frequency stimulation are: (1) depolarization blocking of neuronal transmission through inactivation of voltage dependent ion-channels, (2) jamming of information by imposing an efferent stimulation-driven high-frequency pattern, (3) synaptic inhibition by stimulation of inhibitory afferents to the target nucleus, (4) synaptic failure by stimulation-induced neurotransmitter depletion. As the hyperactivity of the STN is considered a functional hallmark of PD and as there is experimental evidence for STN-mediated glutamatergic excitotoxicity on neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), STN-DBS might reduce glutamatergic drive, leading to neuroprotection. Further studies will be needed to elucidate if STN-DBS indeed provides a slow-down of disease progression.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "Experimental pain perception remains equally active over all sleep stages.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "19475051", "authors": ["Roubertie, A", "Leydet, J", "Rivier, F", "Humbertclaude, V", "Cheminal, R", "Echenne, B"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Pain", "abstract": "Layer 5 neurons in primary visual cortex make putative reciprocal feedback connections to the superficial layers. To test this hypothesis, we employed scanning laser photostimulation combined with intracellular dye injection to examine local functional excitatory inputs to and axonal projections from individual layer 5 neurons in brain slices from monkey V1. In contrast with previous studies of other V1 neurons, layer 5 neurons received significant input from nearly all of the cortical layers, suggesting individual layer 5 cells integrate information from a broad range of input sources. Nevertheless relative strengths of laminar inputs varied across neurons. Cluster analysis of relative strength of laminar inputs to individual layer 5 neurons revealed four discrete clusters representing recurring input patterns; each cluster included both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Twenty-five of 40 layer 5 neurons fell into two clusters, both characterized by very strong input from superficial layers. These input patterns are consistent with layer 5 neurons providing feedback to superficial layers. The remaining 15 neurons received stronger input from deep layers. Differences in input from layer 4Calpha versus 4Cbeta also suggest specific associations of the magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways, with populations receiving stronger input from deep versus superficial cortical layers.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "[Movement disorders in childhood: therapeutic update].", "issue": "8", "pmid": "19475077", "authors": ["Sugiyama, K"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Archives de p\u00e9diatrie : organe officiel de la Soci\u00e9te fran\u00e7aise de p\u00e9diatrie", "abstract": "High-frequency stimulation of the globus pallidus (GP) has emerged as a successful tool for treating Parkinson's disease and other motor disorders. However, the mechanism governing its therapeutic effect is still under debate. To shed light on the basic mechanism of deep brain stimulation (DBS), we performed microstimulation in the GP of a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated monkey while recording with other microelectrodes in the same nucleus. We used robust methods to reduce the stimulus artifact, and 600-3000 repetitions of a single stimulus and of high-frequency short trains (10-40 stimuli), enabling high temporal resolution analysis of neural responses. Low-frequency stimulation yielded a typical three-stage response: short-term (2-3 msec duration) activity, followed by mid-term (15-25 msec) inhibition, and occasionally longer-term (30-40 msec) excitation. Trains of high-frequency stimuli elicited complex locking of the response to the stimuli in most neurons. The locking displayed a stereotypic temporal structure consisting of three short-duration (1-2 msec) phases: an initial (mean latency = 2.9 msec) excitation followed by an inhibition (4.6 msec) and a second excitation (6.3 msec). The change in the mean firing rate was mixed; the majority of the neurons displayed partial inhibition during the stimulus train. Slow inhibitory and excitatory multiphase changes in the firing rate were observed after the stimulus trains. The activity of neurons recorded simultaneously displayed rate correlations but no spike-to-spike correlations. Our results suggest that the effect of DBS on the GP is not complete inhibition but rather a complex reshaping of the temporal structure of the neuronal activity within that nucleus.", "pages": "255-65"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "[Thalamic deep brain stimulation therapy: a guide to stereotactic brain operations].", "issue": "5", "pmid": "19876151", "authors": ["Moseley, GL", "Nicholas, MK", "Hodges, PW"], "year": "2004", "journal": "No shinkei geka.
