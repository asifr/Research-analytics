The placebo effect has been widely documented by randomized placebo-controlled drug studies. One of the best examples of placebo effectiveness is that have been shown in clinical trials of anti-parkinsonian drugs. The placebo effect is observable not only in drug trials but also with deep brain stimulation. Recent advances in research on the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested that motor symptoms of PD can be essentially improved by placebo. A recent study using positron emission tomography (PET) with raclopride demonstrated that release of endogeneous dopamine in the dorsal striatum occurs in placebo-responsive patients with PD. This suggests that placebo-induced expectation of clinical improvement may activate endogenous dopamine in the striatum, and that placebo effectiveness is thus achieved by endogenous dopamine supplementation. Indeed, decreased neuronal activities in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), that were recorded during surgery to implant deep brain stimulation electrodes, correlated well with placebo-induced clinical improvement in patients with PD. Although the detailed pathophysiological mechanism underlying the placebo effects remains uncertain, theoretically, the placebo effect has generally been explained by two different mechanisms: one is conditioning theory (pavlovian conditioning), and the other is cognitive theory (expectation of clinical improvement). Although both mechanisms may contribute to placebo effects, the placebo effect in PD may be attributed more to cognitive mechanisms such as expectation of improvement, because the placebo effect can be obtained in de novo PD patients. There have been accumulating findings that suggest a functional relationship between dopamine and the expectation of clinical improvement (reward). Further basic studies are required to clarify the complex link between dopamine and the reward system, but such findings will contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the placebo effect in PD.", "pages": "139-46"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Functional Neurosurgery Resident Award: controlling the cardiovascular system with deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17380769", "authors": ["Green, AL", "Wang, S", "Owen, SL", "Paterson, DJ", "Xie, K", "Liu, X", "Bain, PG", "Stein, JF", "Aziz, TZ"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurosurgery", "abstract": "Computer-assisted neurosurgery has become so successful that it is rapidly becoming indistinguishable from, quite simply, neurosurgery. This trend promises to accelerate over the next several decades, bringing considerable benefit to the patients we care for. From a pragmatic point of view, can we identify specific instances in which clinical practice has been altered by computer assistance? During craniotomies for the resection of brain tumors, this technology has led to a greater standardization within and among practitioners for the expected degree of resection and the risk of morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive approaches are transforming the practice of cranial base surgery. This technological trend has made craniotomy for biopsy virtually obsolete in the face of frameless stereotactic techniques. Functional neurosurgery has benefited from these technologies, as deep brain stimulation surgery has become the standard of care for most cases of movement disorder surgery. Extratemporal epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia has proven especially amenable to image-guided surgical techniques that integrate electrophysiological monitoring to refine the target of resection. New surgical procedures made possible by computer assistance include minimally invasive spine surgery, endovascular procedures, resections of low-grade nonenhancing gliomas, and stereotactic radiosurgery. A program for future research and development in this field would include: Electronic patient medical records. Automatic dynamic and elastic registration Novel surgical instrumentation guided by augmented reality Real-time feedback using anatomic and functional information Active robotic servo control systems to amplify neurosurgical capabilities Outcomes analysis-driven refinement of neurosurgical interventions. It is apparent that using computer assistance in neurosurgery has begun a process that will irrevocably transform all of neurosurgical practice itself. It must be neurosurgeons themselves who provide the leadership to transcend the potentially distracting aspects of this technological revolution.

Despite widespread use, the sites of activation (AP generation) within the brain are not well understood. We have integrated computational and neurophysiologic models including a 3D volume conduction head model computed using the finite element method, a realistic corticospinal tract (CST) model, and a geometry-specific axon activation model for the CST to predict the sites of activation along the CST as a function of electrode placement and stimulation voltage, which have been verified by epidural recordings.

Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during rest and orthostatic conditions, HR variability (HRV) and breathing-induced cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstriction (CVC) were tested in 14 PD patients treated with STN stimulation during \"ON\" and \"OFF\" condition of the stimulator. The effects of a single dose of levodopa on ANS were tested in 15 PD patients without DBS. STN stimulation had no influence on cardiovascular ANS functions, whereas CVC was significantly increased. In contrast, levodopa significantly lowered BP and HR at rest and enhanced orthostatic hypotension. Further, HRV, skin perfusion and temperature increased after administration of levodopa. Our results suggest that in contrast to levodopa, STN stimulation has only minor effects on autonomic functions.

Because the majority of dystonia is medically refractory and surgical treatment results in marked improvement, the authors strongly believe that dystonia should be regarded as a definite neurosurgical indication. Based on personal experience of nearly 200 cases of dystonia surgery, the authors describe a multimodal approach to various types of dystonias.

The growing utility of surgical and device-related treatments for psychiatric conditions may represent a sea change in the field of psychiatry comparable to that seen in other clinical disciplines. For example, for many years the overwhelming majority of cardiac conditions were treated with medications and behavioral interventions. With the advent of cardiac surgical procedures such as ablation and cardiac bypass surgery and the use of devices such as cardiac stents and pacemakers, the ability to treat cardiac disease has improved dramatically. The hope is that the use of neurotherapeutic interventions will lead to a similar improvement in the treatment of psychiatric illness. The future of neurotherpeutic interventions in psychiatry may include the use of neuroimaging technology to predict with patients may respond to which procedures or to guide the placement of DBS electrodes on an individual basis. DBS electrodes also could be placed in multiple brain regions. Clinical trials of cortical stimulation using surgically implanted electrodes on the brain surface are underway. These cortical-surface electrodes could provide cortical stimulation comparable to that induced by rTMS at the same location, obviating the need for visits to a physician for rTMS treatments and providing cortical stimulation of a greater magnitude and for an extended duration. Also, one can foresee surgical interventions in which neurotransmitter release is potentiated either by stimulating appropriate nuclei in the brain or by releasing neurotransmitters or neurotransmitter precursors into target brain regions using cannulae or an implanted device. Neurotrophic factors also could be introduced into target brain regions using analogous techniques.

We co-register the imaging data with detailed finite element models of the brain and stimulating electrode to enable anatomically and electrically accurate predictions of the spread of stimulation. One critical component of the model is the DTI tensor field that is used to represent the 3-dimensionally anisotropic and inhomogeneous tissue conductivity.

Our results show that inclusion of the tensor field in our model caused significant differences in the size and shape of the VTA when compared to a homogeneous, isotropic tissue volume. The magnitude of these differences was proportional to the stimulation voltage.

Most of the recent studies used only clinical data to analyse tremor reduction. The objective of our study was to quantify tremor reduction by STN DBS and antiparkinsonian medication in elderly PD patients using an objective measuring system. Amplitude and frequency of resting tremor and re-emergent resting tremor during postural tasks were analysed using an ultrasound-based measuring system and surface electromyography. In a prospective study design nine patients with advanced PD were examined preoperatively off and on medication, and twice postoperatively during four treatment conditions: off treatment, on STN DBS, on medication, and on STN DBS plus medication. While both STN DBS and medication reduced tremor amplitude, STN DBS alone and the combination of medication and STN DBS were significantly superior to pre- and postoperative medication. STN DBS but not medication increased tremor frequency, and off treatment tremor frequency was significantly reduced postoperatively compared to baseline. These findings demonstrate that STN DBS is highly effective in elderly patients with advanced PD and moderate preoperative tremor reduction by medication. Thus, with regard to the advanced impact on the other parkinsonian symptoms, STN DBS can replace thalamic stimulation in this cohort of patients. Nevertheless, medication was still effective postoperatively and may act synergistically. The significantly superior efficacy of STN DBS on tremor amplitude and its impact on tremor frequency in contrast to medication might be explained by the influence of STN DBS on additional neural circuits independent from dopaminergic neurotransmission.", "pages": "139-46"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Who are you talking about?

Only animals showing severe L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) were included, and STN-HFS was applied for 5 d at an intensity efficient for alleviating akinesia without inducing dyskinesias. L-DOPA treatment alone induced FosB/deltaFosB immunoreactivity, exacerbated the postlesional increase in preproenkephalin, reversed the decrease in preprotachykinin, and markedly increased mRNA levels of preprodynorphin and of the glial glutamate transporter GLT1, which were respectively decreased and unaffected by the dopamine lesion. STN-HFS did not affect per se the postlesion changes in any of these markers. However, when applied in association with L-DOPA treatment, it potentiated the positive modulation exerted by L-DOPA on all of the markers examined and tended to exacerbate LIDs. After 5 d of L-DOPA withdrawal, the only persisting drug-induced responses were an elevation in preprodynorphin mRNA levels and in the number of FosB/deltaFosB-immunoreactive neurons. Selective additional increases in these two markers were measured when STN-HFS was applied subsequently to L-DOPA treatment. These data provide the first evidence that STN-HFS exacerbates the responsiveness of striatal cells to L-DOPA medication and suggest that STN-HFS acts specifically through an L-DOPA-modulated signal transduction pathway associated with LIDs in the striatum. They point to striatal cells as a primary site for the complex interactions between these two therapeutic approaches in PD and argue against a direct anti-dyskinetic action of STN-HFS.", "pages": "139-46"}, {"volume": "59", "title": "Long-term results of radiosurgery for refractory cluster headache.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "15975946", "authors": ["McClelland, S", "Tendulkar, RD", "Barnett, GH", "Neyman, G", "Suh, JH"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for intractable epilepsy, yet the optimum target and underlying mechanism remain controversial. We used the rat pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure model to evaluate the effectiveness of DBS to three targets: two known to be critical for arousal, the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and the orexin/hypocretinergic perifornical area (PFN), and the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATH) now in clinical trial. TMN stimulation provided the strong protection against the seizure, and PFN stimulation elicited a moderate effect yet accompanying abnormal behavior in 25% subjects, while ATH stimulation aggravated the seizure. Power density analysis showed EEG desynchronization after DBS on TMN and PFN, while DBS on ATH caused no effect with the same stimulation intensity. EEG desynchronization after TMN stimulation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pyrilamine, a histamine H(1) receptor selective antagonist, while the effect of PFN stimulation was inhibited even at a low dose. In parallel, in vivo microdialysis revealed a prominent increase of histamine release in the frontal cortex after TMN stimulation, a moderate level with PFN and none with ATH. Furthermore, antiepileptic effect of DBS to TMN was also blocked by an H(1) receptor antagonist.

The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution MRI make radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise.

The results from radiosurgical pallidotomy, as opposed to those of gamma thalamotomy, have been disappointing. A 50% complication rate in the former (homonymous field cuts, hemipareses and dysphagias) combined with a poor success rate has led us to reevaluate the indications for this procedure in the face of the excellent results from radiofrequency pallidotomy with physiological monitoring and deep brain stimulation. Perhaps experience with lowered radiosurgical prescription doses will improve the complication rate. There appears to be a differential sensitivity of the pallidum to radiation, anatomically, than the thalamus.

The placebo effect has been widely documented by randomized placebo-controlled drug studies. One of the best examples of placebo effectiveness is that have been shown in clinical trials of anti-parkinsonian drugs. The placebo effect is observable not only in drug trials but also with deep brain stimulation. Recent advances in research on the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested that motor symptoms of PD can be essentially improved by placebo. A recent study using positron emission tomography (PET) with raclopride demonstrated that release of endogeneous dopamine in the dorsal striatum occurs in placebo-responsive patients with PD. This suggests that placebo-induced expectation of clinical improvement may activate endogenous dopamine in the striatum, and that placebo effectiveness is thus achieved by endogenous dopamine supplementation. Indeed, decreased neuronal activities in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), that were recorded during surgery to implant deep brain stimulation electrodes, correlated well with placebo-induced clinical improvement in patients with PD. Although the detailed pathophysiological mechanism underlying the placebo effects remains uncertain, theoretically, the placebo effect has generally been explained by two different mechanisms: one is conditioning theory (pavlovian conditioning), and the other is cognitive theory (expectation of clinical improvement). Although both mechanisms may contribute to placebo effects, the placebo effect in PD may be attributed more to cognitive mechanisms such as expectation of improvement, because the placebo effect can be obtained in de novo PD patients. There have been accumulating findings that suggest a functional relationship between dopamine and the expectation of clinical improvement (reward).

At disease onset, a compensatory hyperactivity of dopa decarboxylase in the nigrostriatal and extrastriatal dopaminergic pathways and upregulation of postsynaptic D2 receptor have been demonstrated. In the advanced stage, an excessively earlier release of dopamine from the residual neurons has been shown, suggesting a relationship with motor complications. In terms of therapy of PD, functional images have provided some objective evidences for possible neuroprotective effect of dopamine agonists, survival of fetal dopaminergic tissue grafted into patient's putamen, an increase of dopamine release by BDNF focal infusion therapy, and functional modification by deep brain stimulation.
