Most of our knowledge about the hierarchical network of supraspinal locomotor centers derives from animal experiments, mainly in the cat. We posed the question of whether evolutionary transition from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion--with associated change of foreleg function--caused reorganization of these supraspinal locomotor centers. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified separate and distinct cerebellar and brainstem BOLD signal increases related to posture and gait during mental imagery of standing, walking, and running in healthy volunteers (n=26). Comparison with the locomotion centers in the cat showed that these activations include the pacemakers for gait initiation and speed regulation in the interfastigial cerebellum and bilateral midbrain tegmentum (cerebellar and mesencephalic locomotor regions), their descending target regions in the pontine reticular formation, and the rhythm generators in the cerebellar vermis and paravermal cortex. Moreover, during mental imagery of stance, a BOLD signal increase was observed in the dorsal pons, reflecting an activation of the dorsal tegmental field, a locomotion-suppressing site in the cat. These results support the view that the organization of supraspinal locomotor centers was preserved during the transition to bipedal locomotion. The clinical relevance of these centers has so far been largely neglected. However, Parkinson's disease, for example, is associated with reduced cell counts in the pedunculopontine nucleus, a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region.

NAc DBS reduced the mean firing rate of OFC neurons, although neurons receiving monosynaptic input from MD were less affected and some putative interneurons were excited by DBS. Single-pulse stimulation of the NAc produced a robust inhibition in OFC neurons that was attenuated after DBS, whereas excitatory responses were unchanged. In contrast, after DBS inhibitory responses evoked from MD were unchanged, whereas excitatory responses were enhanced. NAc-evoked LFP responses were potentiated after DBS, whereas MD-evoked LFP responses were unchanged. NAc DBS also enhanced OFC spontaneous LFP oscillatory activity in the slow (0.5-4 Hz) frequency band. These results suggest that DBS of the NAc region may alleviate OCD symptoms by reducing activity in subsets of OFC neurons, potentially by driving recurrent inhibition though antidromic activation of corticostriatal axon collaterals.

Yet these effects remain essentially unexplained, even paradoxical. Equally challenging is the fact that DBS of motor targets in the basal ganglia appears to reverse abnormalities of movement without any obvious deleterious effects on remaining aspects of movement. Here, we explore the extent to which the noisy signal hypothesis might help solve some of these apparent paradoxes. Essentially the hypothesis, first tentatively advanced by Marsden and Obeso (1994), suggests that disease leads to a pattern of basal ganglia activity that disrupts local and distant function and that surgery acts to suppress or override this noisy signal. Critical to the success this theory is that different disease phenotypes are associated with different patterns of noisy signal, and we survey the evidence to support this contention, with specific emphasis on different types of pathological synchronization. However, just as DBS may suppress or override noisy signals in the basal ganglia, it must equally antagonize any remaining physiological functioning in these key motor structures. We argue that the latter effect of DBS becomes manifest when baseline motor performance is relatively preserved, i.e., when pathological activity is limited. Under these circumstances, the deleterious effects of DBS are no longer obscured by its therapeutic actions in suppressing noisy signals. Whether true, oversimplified or simply incorrect, the noisy signal hypothesis has served to focus attention on the detailed character of basal ganglia discharge and its variation with disease and therapy.", "pages": "56-63"}, {"volume": "107", "title": "Prospective randomized double-blind trial of bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation in adults with Tourette syndrome.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "4961088", "authors": ["Maciunas, RJ", "Maddux, BN", "Riley, DE", "Whitney, CM", "Schoenberg, MR", "Ogrocki, PJ", "Albert, JM", "Gould, DJ"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Brain electrical stimulation has been proposed as a strategy to improve chronically impaired cognitive function.

These deficits are thought to result from deficient gating of sensory information due to basal ganglia dysfunction in PD. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has been shown to improve sensory deficits in PD, e.g. STN-DBS normalizes the perception of urinary bladder filling in patients with PD. This study aimed at investigating how STN-DBS modulates the processing of urinary bladder information to elucidate the (patho-)physiology of sensory gating mechanisms in PD. Nine PD patients with bilateral STN-DBS switched on (STN-DBS ON) or off (STN-DBS OFF) were studied during dynamic bladder filling and an empty bladder condition (for control), while changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured by PET. Urinary bladder filling led to an increased rCBF in the periaqueductal grey (PAG), the posterior thalamus, the insular cortex as well as in the right frontal cortex and the cerebellum bilaterally. A significant interaction between bladder condition and STN-DBS was observed in the posterior thalamus and the insular cortex, with enhanced modulation of these areas during STN-DBS ON compared to STN-DBS OFF. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed a modulation of the neural activity in the thalamus and the insular cortex by the PAG activity during STN-DBS ON only. Thus, STN-DBS led to a significant enhancement of afferent urinary bladder information processing. The data suggest that STN-DBS facilitates the discrimination of different bodily states by supporting sensory perception and the underlying neural mechanisms.

For progress to continue, however, we need to take a broad view of this disorder, which includes recognition of the following. First, substantial evidence now indicates that dopamine oxidation is unlikely to substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Second, levodopa therapy is not associated with neurotoxicity. Third, the first neurons affected in PD are nondopaminergic; the substantia nigra and other dopaminergic nuclei are affected only later in the course. Thus, PD is much more than degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system. Fourth, in the current era, most of the disability of advancing PD is from involvement of nondopaminergic systems, including levodopa-refractory motor symptoms, dementia, and dysautonomia. Motor complications associated with levodopa therapy can be problematic, but they can be controlled in most, using available medications and deep brain stimulation surgery. We have reached the point of diminishing therapeutic returns with drugs acting on dopamine systems; more dopaminergic medications will provide only modest incremental benefit over current therapies. Finally, the benefits from transplantation surgeries aimed at restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission will be limited because later-stage PD disability comes from nondopaminergic substrates.

Furthermore, these studies have varied in their methodology and findings, so it remains unclear whether stimulation at any or all frequencies < or = 20 Hz impairs movement and if so, whether effects are identical across this broad frequency band. To address these issues, 18 PD patients chronically implanted with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in both subthalamic nuclei were stimulated bilaterally at 5, 10 and 20 Hz after overnight withdrawal of their medication and the effects of the DBS on a finger tapping task were compared to performance without DBS (0 Hz).

Asymmetrical symptom onset, resting tremor,and sustained response to levodopa are key features that suggest a diagnosis of PD. For most patients, PD progresses fairly slowly. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms, thereby allowing quality of life and functional ability to be maintained. Pharmacologic therapies are primarily targeted at stimulating dopaminergic receptors, either by increasing the levels of dopamine or by using dopamine agonists. Levodopa, the main therapy for PD and a precursor of dopamine, has a short half-life and is quickly metabolized.Accordingly, decarboxylase inhibitors, like carbidopa, are almost always administered with levodopa to prevent breakdown in the periphery. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)inhibitors, which increase dopamine levels by inhibiting the metabolism of levodopa and dopamine, recently have become available, including a tablet containing carbidopa, levodopa,and entacapone. Other pharmaceutical therapies for PD include dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, and amantadine. Dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, and amantadine are associated with an increased risk of hallucinations or other adverse events in elderly patients; therefore, use of these should be avoided in this population. Surgical management, particularly deep brain stimulation(DBS), is an option for patients who are refractory to pharmaceutical therapy. Although patients may not need levodopa as an initial treatment, over time most patients will require this drug to control symptoms.

Here, we report the unexpected finding that HFS of the STN inhibits midbrain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons to evoke depression-related behavioral changes. We found that bilateral HFS of the STN consistently inhibited (40-50%) the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the rat, but not neighboring non-5-HT neurons. This effect was apparent at clinically relevant stimulation parameters (> or =100 Hz, > or =30 microA), was not elicited by HFS of either neighboring or remote structures to the STN, and was still present in rat models of PD. We also found that bilateral HFS of the STN evoked clear-cut, depressive-like behavior in a widely used experimental paradigm of depression (forced swim test), and this effect was also observed in a PD model. Importantly, the depressive-like behavior elicited by HFS of the STN was reversed by a selective 5-HT-enhancing antidepressant, thereby linking the behavioral change to decreased 5-HT neuronal activity. Overall, these findings link reduced 5-HT function to the psychiatric effects of HFS of the STN observed in PD patients and provide a rational basis for their clinical management. More generally, the powerful interaction between the STN and 5-HT system uncovered here offers insights into the high level of comorbidity of basal ganglia disease and mood disorder.", "pages": "56-63"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Histone-like DNA binding protein of Streptococcus intermedius induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes via activation of ERK1/2 and JNK pathways.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17973330", "authors": ["Liu, D", "Yumoto, H", "Hirota, K", "Murakami, K", "Takahashi, K", "Hirao, K", "Matsuo, T", "Ohkura, K", "Nagamune, H", "Miyake, Y"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Cellular microbiology", "abstract": "Abnormal sensory processing has been implicated in the pathophysiology of primary dystonia. In the globus pallidus internus (GPi), the primary output structure of the basal ganglia, many neurons respond to sensory (proprioceptive) stimulation. Here we have characterized GPi neuronal responses to passive movement of the contralateral limbs in 22 patients with primary dystonia undergoing microelectrode recording for placement of deep brain stimulator leads. We plotted coordinates of cells responding to limb movement in a common space. We observed distinct representations of leg and arm movement localized to the dorsal and ventral part of the posterior GPi, respectively. Comparing patients with generalized dystonia versus patients with segmental craniocervical dystonia, there was no difference in the volumes or separations of leg and arm related territories. In contrast to parkinsonism, only a small minority of units were responsive to movement across multiple joints. Abnormally increased directional selectivity was found in units responding to dystonic limbs compared with nondystonic limbs. Some affected GPi neurons therefore appear to have altered proprioceptive tuning for movement direction. There is an apparent preservation of GPi somatotopic organization in dystonia in comparison with prior studies of GPi somatotopic organization in non-human primates and humans with Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "56-63"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "[Present status of psychosurgery in Spain].", "issue": "4", "pmid": "17966631", "authors": ["Barcia, JA", "Bertol\u00edn-Guill\u00e9n, JM", "Barcia-Gonz\u00e1lez, J", "Campos, J", "Hern\u00e1ndez, ME"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Neurocirug\u00eda (Asturias, Spain)", "abstract": "Longitudinal studies typically report estimates of the effect of a treatment or exposure at various times during the course of follow-up.

To decrease large animal killing, expense and time to human trials, an in vitro human tissue testing process was developed and compared to standard animal testing. A permanently implantable deep brain stimulation lead was subjected to both qualitative and quantitative cell culture studies using in vitro human cerebellar, cortical and glial cell lines. Materials were extracted in both saline (72 h at 50 degrees C) and minimum essential medium (24 h at 37 degrees C) environments. All cytotoxicity and cell proliferation testing resulted in positive controls (Tygon) F-4040-A) showing severe cytotoxicity in all cell lines, negative controls (high-density polyethylene) and both extraction media above showing non-cytotoxic results in all cell lines.
