Intracellular recordings were made from the output neurons (mitral and tufted cells) of the rat olfactory bulb during electrical orthodromic stimulation of the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) and antidromic stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract and posterior piriform cortex (pPC) to test for physiological differences among the neuron types. Many of these neurons were identified by intracellular injections of biocytin, and others were identified by their pattern of antidromic activation. 2. Both marked and unmarked mitral cells showed large inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in response to antidromic stimulation of the pPC, whereas tufted cells exhibited small IPSPs in response to pPC stimulation. Tufted cells, however, showed large IPSPs in response to ONL stimulation. In many cases, these tufted cell responses to ONL stimulation were larger than the mitral cell responses. The marked superficial tufted cells, those with basal dendrites in the superficial sublayer of the external plexiform layer (EPL), had the smallest IPSPs in response to pPC stimulation. These data support anatomic observations suggesting that the granule cell populations responsible for the IPSPs may be different for mitral and for superficial tufted cells. 3. The different types of output cells also showed differences in their responses to orthodromic stimulation. Type I mitral cells, which have basal dendrites confined to the deep sublayer of the EPL, were significantly less excitable by ONL stimulation than were the type II mitral cells, which have basal dendrites distributed within the intermediate sublayer of the EPL. Half of the type I mitral cells could not be excited at all by ONL stimulation. Superficial tufted cells showed even greater orthodromic excitability than type II mitral cells, usually responding to ONL stimulation with two or more spikes. 4. The ionic basis of the IPSPs in the superficial tufted cells appeared similar to those described for mitral cells. These IPSPs could be reversed by chloride injection and were associated with increased membrane conductance. 5. For both mitral and tufted cells, the number of ONL electrodes evoking IPSPs was greater than the number evoking spikes. These data suggest a kind of center-surround organization of inputs to these cells from the ONL, although this does not yet imply that the sensory receptive field of these output cells has a center-surround organization. 6. In conclusion, the properties of rat olfactory bulb output cells correlate with the sublayers of the EPL in which their basal dendrites lie.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Neuronal activity in the second somatosensory cortex of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during active touch of gratings.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8360718", "authors": ["Sinclair, RJ", "Burton, H"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "1. In penetrations made into the upper bank of the lateral sulcus in two monkeys (Macaca mulatta), cells were isolated from the second somatosensory cortex (SII). During single-cell recordings, animals performed an active touch task in which they rubbed their fingertips over pairs of gratings differing in groove width and indicated which was the smoother surface. Hand motion and downward applied force were measured and recorded during these strokes. 2. In this survey, 151 penetrations provided observations on 352 cells that responded to passive stimulation of the digits or during performance of the active touch task. Consistent with previous reports, receptive fields (RFs) in SII were large, often multi-digit, and frequently included a portion or all of the hand and occasionally the arm. Modality was determined for 92 of 127 fully characterized cells, and included 70 cutaneous, 5 deep, 11 Pacinian corpuscle, and 6 joint cells. Characteristic of SII, modality could not be defined in 35 cells that were unresponsive to passive stimulation or whose responses varied widely over time. 3. Response properties of a subgroup of 79 cells in SII resembled those previously studied in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) using identical procedures. Correlation analysis revealed that 29 of these cells, like a portion of cells in SI, responded to changes in groove width independent of force or velocity. This selectivity could be considered a form of feature specificity. 4. In contrast to SI and VPL, transient responses to the fingertips contacting small elevated metal bars, which demarcated the beginning, middle, and end of strokes across the gratings, were seen in a majority of SII cells (109/127). During contact with bars, 89 cells displayed excitatory responses and 20 cells showed suppressed activity. Twelve cells, which responded to bars in isolation from gratings, provided a possible example of increased stimulus selectivity. 5. Passive stimulation failed to activate 16 cells that responded, in some cases differentially to gratings or force, during the task. Responses of nine other cells demonstrated task-dependent modulation in the form of response reduction or enhancement during selected portions of the stroke. In these same cells, response changes did not occur under comparable stimulus conditions in other portions of the stroke that differed only in behavioral context. These types of selective response modulations, not noted in our previous studies of VPL or SI, suggest that mechanisms regulating sensory inputs may affect SII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Sinus arrhythmia and pupil size in Chiari I malformation: evidence of autonomic dysfunction.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "8314116", "authors": ["Stovner, LJ", "Kruszewski, P", "Shen, JM"], "year": "", "journal": "Functional neurology", "abstract": "In a prospective study on latent autonomic dysfunction in the Chiari type I malformation, 15 patients were examined for degree of sinus arrhythmia in the supine and the sitting positions with a deep breathing test, and for pupil size and function with electronic pupillometry after sympathicomimetic eyedrop stimulation.

CCI rats used in the experiment exhibited demonstrable thermal hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain behaviors 10 d after sciatic nerve ligation when the 2-DG experiment was carried out. In the absence of overt peripheral stimulation, reliable increases in 2-DG metabolic activity were observed in CCI rats as compared to sham-operated rats within extensive brain regions that have been implicated in supraspinal nociceptive processing. These brain regions included cortical somatosensory areas, cingulate cortex, amygdala, ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus, posterior thalamic nucleus, hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, central gray matter, deep layers of superior colliculus, pontine reticular nuclei, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and paragigantocellular nucleus. The increase in 2-DG metabolic activity was bilateral in most brain regions of CCI rats. However, somatosensory regions within the thalamus and the cerebral cortex were activated in CCI rats. High levels of 2-DG metabolic activity were observed within the cortical hind limb area, ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus, and posterior thalamic nucleus contralateral to the ligated sciatic nerve, and these levels were higher than ipsilateral corresponding regions in CCI rats. In addition, patterns of increased neural activity found in the brain of CCI rats showed some similarities and differences to those found in the brain of rats exposed to acute nociception induced by noxious heat or formalin stimulation. Thus, these CCI-induced spontaneous increases in neural activity within extensive brain regions of CCI rats previously implicated in sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational dimensions of pain as well as centrifugal modulation of pain are likely to reflect brain neural processing of spontaneous pain. Implications of increased brain neural activity in mechanisms of neuropathic pain are discussed with emphasis on correlations between spatial patterns of altered brain neural activity and pain-related behaviors in CCI rats and clinical symptoms in neuropathic pain patients.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "69", "title": "Giant cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus of mice: intracellular recordings in slices.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "8389822", "authors": ["Zhang, S", "Oertel, D"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "1. In slices of the murine cochlear nuclear complex, intracellular recordings were made from five giant cells that were identified by intracellular labeling with biocytin. Giant cells form one of the two output pathways of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Understanding how neuronal circuits and intrinsic electrical properties interact to control the firing of giant cells is a step toward understanding what acoustic information is conveyed through these cells. 2. Cell bodies of the labeled giant cells lay in the deep layer of the DCN. Dendrites, widespread both along the isofrequency axis and along the tonotopic axis, occupied mainly the deep layer, but some distal ends strayed into the molecular layer. Axons of giant cells were large, varying between 1 and 2 microns diam, and left through the dorsal acoustic stria. They were not observed to branch in the cochlear nuclei. 3. Giant cells fired large, overshooting action potentials that were followed by two afterhyperpolarizations. The first brought the membrane potential below rest, independent of the strength of injected current. The more variable second one produced either an undershoot or an inflection in the membrane potential between action potentials. 4. In each of the five labeled giant cells, shocks to the nerve root or to the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) evoked a monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential and two tandem inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the first 10 ms. Later IPSPs followed after latencies of between 10 and 50 ms. Monosynaptic excitation was usually cut short by the inhibition. 5. Strychnine, at 1 microM, blocked all IPSPs in the one giant cell tested, indicating that inhibitory input to this giant cell from circuits intrinsic to the cochlear nuclear complex was glycinergic. 6. The location of afferents was mapped for two giant cells. Both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to giant cells could be driven by the local application of glutamate to many loci in the AVCN and posteroventral cochlear nucleus, indicating that the ventral cochlear nucleus VCN contains interneurons that are monosynaptically or polysynaptically connected to giant cells. 7. An interpretation consistent with the results is that giant cells are excited by auditory nerve fibers and are inhibited by tuberculoventral cells. Giant cells may also be excited by granule or T stellate cells.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "[Somatosensory evoked potentials in patients undergoing circulatory arrest under profound hypothermia].", "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "8326930", "authors": ["Gu\u00e9rit, JM", "Baele, P", "de Tourtchaninoff, M", "Soveges, L", "Dion, R"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The surgical repair of ascending aorta aneurysms can only be carried out under total circulatory arrest, and is consequently to be performed under deep hypothermia, in order to adequately decrease the metabolic requirements of the brain.

The latencies of all SEP components increase to 21 degrees C. Waves N20 and P14 disappear at mean naso-pharyngeal temperatures of 20 degrees C and 17 degrees C, respectively, although a wide inter-individual variability was observed. We suggest to use the P14 disappearance as the criterion to perform the circulatory arrest: in fact, all surviving patients in whom this criterion was fulfilled recovered without any detectable neurological sequellae, while three patients in whom brain activities disappeared independently on body temperature presented with neurological sequellae. Moreover, particularly if patients presenting with ischemia-induced disappearance of Erb's point activities were excluded, we found a significant correlation between the duration of the circulatory arrest and the delay of N20 and P14 reappearance on rewarming. This confirms the importance of sufficient hypothermia, on the one hand; and on the other hand, our findings imply that, even if SEP monitoring considerably decreases the risk of neurological sequellae associated with these operations, the duration of the circulatory arrest should be reduced as far as possible.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "54", "title": "Induction and suppression of immediate-early genes in the rat brain by a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist following noxious peripheral stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8100045", "authors": ["Pertovaara, A", "Bravo, R", "Herdegen, T"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "The effect of medetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist, on noxious stimulation-induced expression of immediate-early genes was studied in the central nervous system of the rat. The expressions of c-JUN, JUN B, c-FOS FOS B and KROX-24 proteins were investigated by immunocytochemistry following the application of formalin (5%, 50 microliters) into the plantar skin of one hindpaw. Medetomidine (100 or 300 micrograms/kg i.p.) was administered 12 min or 5 min before the application of formalin. Atipamezole (1.5 mg/kg i.p.), and alpha-2-adrenoceptor antagonist, administered simultaneously with medetomidine (300 micrograms/kg), was used to reverse the alpha-2-adrenergic effects. The rats were killed and perfused 90 min after formalin injection. Formalin induced expression of all studied proteins in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn and the contralateral parabrachial nucleus, and in the medial thalamus bilaterally. Both medetomidine doses administered 12 min before formalin strongly suppressed the expression of c-FOS in the spinal dorsal horn; the suppression was stronger in the deep (III-VI) than in the superficial (I and II) laminae of the dorsal horn (76% and 86% for 100 micrograms/kg dose vs 97% and 99% for 300 micrograms/kg dose, respectively). However, application of medetomidine 5 min before formalin did not reduce the expression of immediate-early genes. In the parabrachial nucleus, both medetomidine doses also produced a significant suppression of c-FOS expression (68%). In contrast, medetomidine at the dose of 100 micrograms/kg was ineffective in the medical thalamus. Only the higher dose of medetomidine (300 micrograms/kg) produced a suppression by 29% and 46% in centromedian and paraventricular nuclei, respectively. Atipamezole produced a significant attenuation in spinal cord and a complete reversal in parabrachial nucleus of the medetomidine-induced suppression. However, in the medial thalamus, atipamezole produced a dramatic increase of formalin-induced c-FOS expression when compared with formalin injection alone. The expression of c-JUN, JUN B, FOS B and KROX-24 proteins paralleled that of c-FOS. It is concluded that the expression of immediate-early gene encoded proteins is more strongly suppressed by alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonists in spinal and parabrachial than in medial thalamic neurons. The increased expression of immediate-early genes in medical thalamus following atipamezole treatment may be explained by increased release of noradrenaline and the consequent activation of alpha-1- and beta-adrenoceptors. Compared with the previously reported effects of behaviorally equipotent doses of morphine, the suppression of c-FOS expression in the spinal cord was stronger following medetomidine than that following morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "330", "title": "Topography of projections to the frontal lobe from the macaque frontal eye fields.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "8491870", "authors": ["Stanton, GB", "Bruce, CJ", "Goldberg, ME"], "year": "1993", "journal": "The Journal of comparative neurology", "abstract": "Efferents from the frontal eye fields (FEF) to the ipsilateral frontal lobe were studied by autoradiography of tritiated tracers (leucine, proline, and fucose) in seven macaque monkeys that were used previously to describe subcortical connections.

Using an earlobe reference, SEPs were recorded with an array of either five surface electrodes over the contralateral parietal cortex or 32 electrodes distributed over the whole scalp. In normal subjects analysis of frontal potentials revealed an early positive (P22) and negative (N30) component which could not be explained by generators located in the parietal cortex. Apart from the reduction of parietal components (N20, P25) frontal P22 and N30 were diminished or absent in Huntington's disease patients.

At all stages of inflammation (2, 6, 13 and 20 days post inoculation) the population of neurons with ankle input showed differences from the population of neurons with ankle input in control rats. There was a reduction in the number of neurons that appeared as nociceptive specific and a concomitant increase in the number of neurons showing a wide-dynamic-range response profile. The receptive fields of the neurons with ankle input were markedly larger in rats with inflammation in the ankle region and mainly spread proximally on the ipsilateral hindlimb and also to the abdomen and tail in some cases. There was also an increase in the number of neurons with contralateral excitatory inputs. The mechanical thresholds at the ankle joint and proximal parts of the ipsilateral hindlimb were less in arthritic rats than in controls. The proportion of spontaneously active neurons was also increased in rats during the initial and later stages of inflammation, although there was no significant increase in the mean spontaneous discharge frequency. These data show that there are long-term changes in the receptive field and response properties of neurons in intact rats with chronic unilateral adjuvant-induced inflammation similar to those described previously in spinal cats with acute inflammation (Neugebauer and Schaible 1990).

In an awake animal, single tooth-pulp stimuli of 0.1 ms duration and < or = 1 mA intensity produced no aversive behavior. 4. The response of trigeminal brain stem neurons in the awake animal to such stimuli consisted of short (approximately 3 ms)- and long (approximately 25 ms)-latency discharges whose thresholds suggested that they were both due to inputs from fast conducting primary afferent fibers. 5. Light anesthesia reduced the number of impulses in both components and in most cases completely abolished the long-latency component evoked by low-intensity stimuli. The threshold of the short-latency component was little affected by light anesthesia. It is postulated that the short-latency component is mediated by a monosynaptic input from primary afferent fibers and the long-latency component by a polysynaptic input from these same fibers. 6. All neurons that responded to tooth-pulp stimulation had inputs from other orofacial sites both in the awake and lightly anesthetized states.

The primary goals were to test hypotheses concerning the sequence of synaptic events evoked by afferent fiber stimulation and to derive data required for development and testing of the model presented in the companion paper. 2. In confirmation of previous studies, it was found that afferent fiber stimulation evokes a monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in distal segments of pyramidal cell apical dendrites (layer Ia) followed by a strong disynaptic EPSC in adjacent middle segments (superficial layer Ib). 3. Given the central importance of the strong disynaptic EPSC in models for operation of the piriform cortex, the hypothesis that it is mediated by long association fibers from the anterior piriform cortex was tested by comparing its latency in response to stimulation at anterior and posterior locations. The results confirmed the hypothesis and ruled out a significant contribution from local connections in the posterior piriform cortex. 4. Intensification of pyramidal cell activity by spatially restricted disinhibition with picrotoxin confirmed the hypothesis that associational projections from the posterior piriform cortex can mediate a long-latency disynaptic EPSC in proximal dendritic segments (mid to deep layer Ib) in the anterior piriform cortex. 5. Analysis of the time course of the monosynaptic EPSC in different areas revealed that activation of the anterior piriform cortex from afferent fiber stimulation is fast and nearly synchronous throughout its extent as a result of the relatively high conduction velocities of afferent fibers in the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). By contrast, the posterior piriform cortex is sequentially activated by this EPSC as a consequence of the slow propagation velocity of afferent fiber collaterals that course across its surface. This activation is sufficiently slow that a large phase lag is present between rostral and caudal regions. 6. The time courses of the monosynaptic and principal disynaptic EPSCs changed in characteristically different ways with increasing distance from the LOT within the posterior piriform cortex. Simulations in the companion paper indicate that initiation and propagation patterns for activity in fiber systems rather than differences in synaptic conductance waveforms are responsible for these differences. 7. Although the laminar distribution of the active inward current component of the monosynaptic EPSC remained constant over time, the peak outward current associated with this EPSC shifted from the depth of proximal apical dendrites (layer Ib) to the depth of superficial pyramidal cell somata (layer II).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "The effects of localized inactivation of somatosensory cortex, area 3a, on area 2 in cats.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "303972", "authors": ["Porter, LL", "Izraeli, R"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Somatosensory & motor research", "abstract": "In cats and primates, area 3a of the somatosensory cortex is the primary recipient of proprioceptive input (Phillips et al., 1971).

The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of area 3a input on neuronal activity in area 2 of cats. Extracellular recording techniques were used to identify neurons in area 2 that responded to deep stimulation of the contralateral forepaw. Neurons in area 3a that responded to the same receptive field modality and location as those in area 2 were also isolated. Single-unit or multiunit responses and evoked potentials to electrical stimulation of the shared peripheral receptive field and spontaneous activity were recorded from areas 2 and 3a. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, was injected at the area 3a recording site to block neuronal activity. Spontaneous activity and receptive fields were abolished and evoked potentials were considerably diminished at the injection site, immediately after lidocaine was administered. Changes in unit responses, spontaneous activity, and evoked potentials in area 2 were monitored following inactivation of the somatotopically \"matched\" site in area 3a. Unit activity was recorded at 15 matched sites. In area 2, changes in unit responses to the peripheral stimulation and/or in spontaneous activity were observed at most of the recording sites following inactivation of area 3a. Spontaneous activity rates changed at 63% of the sites (mean change = 85%). Unit responses to the peripheral stimulation changed at 57% of the recording sites (mean change = 47%). The remaining sites in area 2 did not show lidocaine-induced changes. These sites may not have been connected with the matched sites in area 3a. Spontaneous activity and unit responses were not always similarly altered at a given site; sometimes one increased while the other decreased. Decreases in unit responses and spontaneous activity following inactivation of area 3a input were the predominant effects, indicating that area 3a has a facilitatory effect on neuronal activity observed in some regions of area 2. However, increases in neuronal activity at some sites indicated that the effects of area 3a input on area 2 are nonuniform.

Some neurons were bimodal, responding to both visual and somatosensory stimuli, while others were purely visual, or purely somatosensory. The bimodal neurons usually responded to light cutaneous stimulation, rather than to joint movement or deep muscle pressure. They responded to visual stimuli near their tactile receptive field and were not selective for the shape or the color of the stimuli.

Using the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation, intracellular recordings were obtained from 91 subicular neurons. Membrane properties and morphological characteristics were similar to those reported for hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Two categories of subicular neurons were distinguished based on their response to a depolarizing current pulse. One type of neuron showed bursting behavior and the second type was characterized as regular firing. Analysis of the charging functions during hyperpolarizing current pulses yielded a mean tau 0 and tau 1 for subicular neurons of about 13 ms and 0.60 ms, respectively. Using the model of an equivalent cylinder, the mean dendrite-to-soma conductance ratio (rho) was estimated at 6.0 and electrotonic length constant (L) at 0.7. There was no difference in these values between bursting and regular firing neurons. Tetrodotoxin-resistant potentials (presumed calcium hump/spike) were evoked from bursting subicular neurons at lower current intensities than CA1 pyramidal neurons. Calcium humps could only be evoked from about half the regular firing subicular neurons. Subicular cells showed an excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP/IPSP) sequence in response to electrical stimulation in different layers of the CA1 area. An EPSP could also be evoked from stimulation of the superficial or deep layers of the presubiculum and was attributed to activation of entorhinal fibers of passage. At high stimulation intensity, an antidromic spike was often evoked following stimulation in the presubicular area of CA1 alveus. The evoked EPSPs were blocked by addition of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) to the bathing medium. In magnesium-free, CNQX bathing solution, a longer lasting depolarization was recorded; this response was blocked by application of a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (AP5). Iontophoretic application of glutamate or quisqualate (10 mM) along the soma-dendritic axis of subicular neurons leads to either a short-latency depolarization or a burst of action potentials. Application of 10 mM GABA near the recording site usually produced a hyperpolarization, which, at times, was mixed with a depolarization. Mixed hyperpolarizing/depolarizing responses were observed when GABA was applied to the basal or apical dendritic areas.

In vitro experiments with glioma cell lines revealed a consistent and reliable relation between EGFr activation and VEGF production; namely, EGF (1-20 ng/ml) stimulation of glioma cells resulted in a 25-125% increase in secretion of bioactive VEGF. Conditioned media (CM) prepared from EGF-stimulated glioma cell lines produced significant increases in cytosolic free intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Neither EGF alone or CM from glioma cultures prepared in the absence of EGF induced [Ca2+]i increases in HUVECs. Preincubation of glioma CM with A4.6.1, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF, completely abolished VEGF-mediated [Ca2+]i transients in HUVECs. Likewise, induction by glioma-derived CM of von Willebrand factor release from HUVECs was completely blocked by A4.6.1 pretreatment. These observations provide a key link in understanding the basic cellular pathophysiology of GBM tumor angiogenesis, increased vascular permeability, and cellular proliferation. Specifically, EGF activation of EGFr expressed on glioma cells leads to enhanced secretion of VEGF by glioma cells.

This was achieved by mapping c-fos induction immunocytochemically as a result of intracortical microstimulation in the distal forelimb area of the motor cortex. The anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin or biocytin were deposited at the site of intracortical microstimulation, the former three weeks and the latter two to three days before stimulation. Neuronal nuclei, labeled for the expressed c-fos protein, were present and mapped in the following structures: motor cortex; basal ganglia (caudate-putamen, globus pallidus); thalamus (reticular, ventromedial and posterior nuclei); subthalamic nucleus; substantia nigra; tectum; red nucleus; pontine nuclei; inferior olive; external cuneate nucleus; cerebellar cortex; deep cerebellar nuclei.

Axonal labeling, including terminal branches and boutons, was also found in most of the above structures with the exception of the globus pallidus, deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar cortex and external cuneate nucleus. These expected exceptions demonstrate that activity changes in these latter structures, as revealed by c-fos labeled neurons, were induced over more than one synapse.

In contrast to the 2-deoxyglucose technique, functional mapping by means of c-fos induction provides cellular resolution, making it possible to establish fine details of axonal contacts with target neurons: boutons in close apposition to c-fos labeled neurons were clearly observed here, for instance in the cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and pontine nuclei. Surprisingly, the ventrolateral and ventrobasalis nuclei of the thalamus contained numerous and dense axon terminals labeled with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin or biocytin, but the contacted neurons in the ventrolateral and ventrobasalis nuclei were not marked with c-fos. However, with respect to directly connected structures, there was, in general, a good correlation between structures with axonal labeling and those with c-fos labeled neurons.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "77", "title": "Control of tremor and involuntary movement disorders by chronic stereotactic stimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8454008", "authors": ["Blond, S", "Caparros-Lefebvre, D", "Parker, F", "Assaker, R", "Petit, H", "Guieu, JD", "Christiaens, JL"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "The authors report on the long-term results of chronic stereotactic stimulation of the ventralis intermedius thalamic nucleus performed in 14 cases of disabling and intractable tremor.

Tremor was assessed by clinical evaluation, surface electromyography, accelerometer, and videotape recordings before and after stimulation. The deep-brain electrode was implanted in the ventralis intermedius nucleus according to stereotactic procedure and connected to a subcutaneous pulse generator after a stimulation test period. Tremor suppression or reduction was obtained in all cases with high-frequency (130 Hz) stimulation. Marked functional improvement was maintained in 11 patients with a mean follow-up interval of 17 months. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias observed in five parkinsonian patients prior to surgery were improved or suppressed in four cases by thalamic stimulation. Stimulation was continued during the day and stopped at night in eight cases. Six patients were stimulated night and day to avoid a rebound effect which appeared as soon as the pulse generator was stopped. The only side effects were hand tonic posture in one case and persistent paresthesia in another case.

Three neurons out of 18 (16.6%) located in the contralateral pRN and six neurons out of 22 (27.3%) located in the ipsilateral pRN were driven by the right SC stimulation.

Each of these four groups of neurons showed a particular pattern of discharge, even though their discharge frequency showed a strong consistency. Four pRN neurons, which responded to SC stimulation, showed a significant correlation with spontaneous horizontal eye movements of saccadic type. It is known that the SC represents one of the main outputs of the striato-nigral motor system. The relation between the SC and the pRN described in the present study suggest that connections exist between the cortico-rubral and the striato-nigral systems, since both have the SC as a common output structure.

For that purpose, anterograde tracers (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin: PHA-L; wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase: WGA-HRP) were deposited in discrete cortical sites physiologically identified by microstimulation. Five major motor areas were considered in this study: the rostral (RFL) and caudal (CFL) forelimb areas, the hindlimb (HL) area, the vibrissae motor-frontal eye field (V-FEF) region and the jaw, lips and tongue (JLT) area (according to the nomenclature of Neafsey et al.). The results indicate that functionally different regions of the motor cortex project to different sectors of the caudate putamen (CPU). All 3 distinct limb areas RFL, CFL and HL project to the dorsolateral quarter of the CPU, V-FEF area projects to the dorsomedial quarter, whereas the JLT area projects to the ventrolateral quarter. The pattern of terminal labeling is relatively consistent, whatever the cortical area in which the tracer is deposited. This pattern is characterized by the presence of two or more labeled bands which are obliquely oriented along a ventrolateral-dorsomedial axis. Control experiments were also undertaken in which a retrograde tracer (WGA-HRP) was deposited in various neostriatal loci. The results are congruent with the findings of the anterograde study and further indicate that a given neostriatal sector receives projections from cytoarchitectonically different but functionally related regions of the neocortex. The somatotopic features of both motor and somatosensory corticostriatal projections appear to be in register. In addition, the striatal distribution of motor cortical fibers was compared in 6 experimental cases to the compartmental subdivision of the striatum in patches and matrix, following immunohistochemical localization of calbindin 28 kDa. The calbindin-immunoreactivity is extremely weak in the dorsolateral sector but is higher in the central and ventrolateral parts of the CPU. In these deep striatal regions receiving fibers from V-FEF, JLT and, to a lesser extent, from the limb areas, the cortical fibers are mostly directed to the matrix. The band-like organization of the projection from the motor cortex is correlated to the patch-matrix organization. The patches correspond to the bands of low density of terminal fibers and the matrix to the bands of high terminal density.

We hypothesized that electrical activation of the area postrema would mimic this transduction process and couple microvascular responses in efferent sites to local increases in tissue metabolism reported previously. We used quantitative autoradiographic techniques and image analysis to measure capillary transfer constants for [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB, a small, neutral amino acid) and blood flow (iodo[14C]antipyrine) in individual brainstem structures of anesthetized rats. The area postrema was stimulated electrically by means of a monopolar microelectrode positioned stereotaxically 100 microns deep in the dorsocentral aspect of the organ. There were no significant effects of stimulation on [14C]AIB influx or blood flow in control hindbrain structures where postremal projections are sparse or absent--the spinal trigeminal nucleus, reticular formation, or cerebellar vermis. Stimulation of the area postrema produced equivalent increases in transcapillary influx of [14C]AIB and capillary blood flow in the nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus nerves, ventrolateral medullary C1 region, locus coeruleus, dorsal tegmental nuclei, and lateral parabrachial nuclei. Formation of ratios interrelating rates of [14C]AIB influx and blood flow with previously assessed values of tissue glucose metabolism indicated that these measures increased proportionately during postremal stimulation. Such proportional increases in capillary [14C]AIB transfer and blood flow during tissue activation by area postrema stimulation are consistent with interpretation that the increase in blood flow resulted from recruitment of unused surface area in the capillary networks of individual efferent nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "67", "title": "Knee joint input into the peripheral region of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of cat thalamus.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "8299754", "authors": ["Hutchison, WD", "L\u00fchn, MA", "Schmidt, RF"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "1.

Four hundred twenty-seven thalamic units were tested for responsiveness to innocuous and noxious somatic stimulation of cutaneous (hair and skin) and deep (muscle and tendon) structures and to innocuous electrical stimulation of the spinal lemniscus (SL). Noxious stimuli were just sufficient to evoke withdrawal and did not cause tissue damage. 3. All neurons were spontaneously active in the absence of intentional stimulation. Only 260 (60.9%) of the neurons recorded in VP responded to somatic or SL stimulation.

Neurons responsive to tectal and sensory stimulation were randomly intermingled with other neurons which had no detectable sensory input. The results indicate that ascending projection neurons of the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus provide an input to functionally diverse subpopulations of intralaminar thalamic neurons. In view of its projections to motor cortex and basal ganglia, the intralaminar thalamus appears directly implicated in basal ganglia and superior colliculus related mechanisms of attention, arousal and postural orienting.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Reticulospinal and reticuloreticular pathways for activating the lumbar back muscles in the rat.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "1791185", "authors": ["Robbins, A", "Pfaff, DW", "Schwartz-Giblin, S"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In the first series of experiments, retrograde tracers were deposited at gigantocellular reticular nucleus (Gi) sites that excited the back muscles and in the contralateral lumbar spinal cord. The medullary reticular formation contralateral to the Gi stimulation/deposition site was examined for the presence of single- and double-labeled cells from these injections. Tracer depositions into Gi produced labeled cells in the contralateral Gi and Parvocellular reticular nucleus (PCRt) whereas the lumbar injections retrogradely labeled cells only in the ventral MRF, indicating that separate populations of medullary reticular cells project to the opposite MRF and the lumbar cord. In the second series of experiments the precise relationships between the location of neurons retrogradely labeled from lumbar spinal cord depositions of the retrograde trace, Fluoro-Gold (FG) and effective stimulation tracks through the MRF were examined. The results indicate that the Gi sites that are most effective for activation of the back muscles are dorsal to the location of retrogradely labeled lumbar reticulospinal cells. To verify that cell bodies and not fibers of passage were stimulated, crystals of the excitatory amino acid agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) were deposited at effective stimulation sites in the Gi. NMDA decreased the ability of electrical stimulation to activate back muscles at 5 min postdeposition, indicating a local interaction of NMDA with cell bodies at the stimulation site. In the third series of experiments, electrical thresholds for EMG activation along a track through the MRF were compared to cells retrogradely labeled from FG deposited into the cervical spinal cord. In some experiments, Fast Blue was also deposited into the contralateral lumbar cord. Neurons at low threshold points on the electrode track were labeled following cervical depositions, indicating a direct projection to the cervical spinal cord. The lumbar depositions, again, labeled cells in MRF areas that were ventral to the locations of effective stimulation sites, primarily on the opposite side of the medulla. In addition, the lumbar depositions back-filled cells in the same cervical segments to which the Gi neurons project. These results suggest that one efferent projection from effective stimulation sites for back muscle activation is onto propriospinal neurons in the cervical cord, which in turn project to lumbar cord levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "90", "title": "Two modes of cerebellar input to the parietal cortex in the cat.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "1380254", "authors": ["Wannier, T", "Kakei, S", "Shinoda, Y"], "year": "1992", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Two distinct parietal regions were activated by stimulation of the cerebellar nuclei (CN). In the first region located in the depth of the bank of the ansate sulcus, stimulation of the CN induced early surface positive-deep negative potentials and late surface negative-deep positive potentials. In this cortical area, potentials of similar shape and time course were evoked at a shorter latency by stimulation of the ventrolateral part of the VA-VL complex where large negative field potentials were evoked by stimulation of the CN. After injection of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) in this part of the VA-VL complex, axon terminals of thalamocortical (TC) fibers were found in layers I, III and IV in the depth of the bank of the ansate sulcus and layers I and III in the motor cortex.

PHA-L injection in this thalamic region stained TC fibers and their terminals in layer I of the suprasylvian gyrus, and in layers I and III of the motor cortex. The laminar distribution of TC axon terminals in two different regions of the parietal cortex could account for the depth profiles of the cerebellar- and the thalamic-evoked potentials in each region.

The cGMP was fixed to tissue protein using a formaldehyde fixative, and an antibody against cGMP was used which was raised against a cGMP-formaldehyde-thyroglobulin conjugate. We used the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) as a model compound to stimulate the particulate enzyme and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to stimulate the soluble enzyme. Sequential immunostaining for cGMP and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed that the great majority of the ANF-responsive, cGMP-producing cells were astrocytes. These ANF-responsive cells were found in discrete parts of the CNS; not all astrocytes in these regions were responsive to ANF. SNP stimulated cGMP in abundantly present neuronal fibres throughout the CNS; few neuronal cell bodies showed increased cGMP production after SNP. Moreover, SNP also raised cGMP in astrocytes, however, not all astrocytes showed the response to SNP. These results suggest that cells might be present in the CNS which contain both the soluble and the particulate guanylate cyclase. It was demonstrated that in the immature cerebellum, the cGMP was raised in glial structures in response to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), ANF, SNP, and kainic acid. The response to NMDA and kainic acid was sensitive to inhibition of the nitric oxide synthesis from L-arginine by NG-methyl-L-arginine. Surprisingly the response to ANF localized in the molecular layer and the granular layer was also sensitive to inhibition by NG-methyl-L-arginine, whereas the response to ANF in the deep nuclei was not. A small depolarization induced by 10 to 20 mmol/l K+ induced an increase in cGMP in chopped hippocampus tissue which showed a biphasic temporal characteristic. The initial, fast (30 sec), peak was shown to be localized in varicose fibres throughout the hippocampus, whereas the slower response (10 min) was localized in astrocytes. These studies demonstrate that the different enzymes which synthesize cGMP are differently localized. However, there is also a time dependency in the activation of the guanylate cyclases, which becomes apparent in different structures at different times.

CT scans of our patients suggested that it could. Moreover, exhaustive physiological explorations of the thalamus with macro- and microstimulation and microelectrode recordings in 2 more patients in whom CT scans suggested thalamic preservation despite massive suprathalamic infarcts, for the purpose of carrying out deep brain stimulation (DBS), revealed no evidence of ascending or descending diencephalic function.

From a quantitative analysis of the propagation of the different types of volleys it appears that the constraints enforced by the morphological and functional characteristics of the PFs lead to an important spatial and temporal dispersion of the action potentials during their displacement along the folium. In particular, the time relationship between activity in the deep and superficial fibers as well as the number and location of active fibers at a given time (i.e. locus) will considerably vary during propagation. Moreover, in the case of a mossy fiber stimulation, there exists a striking asymmetry of the volleys travelling on each side of the site of stimulation. Therefore any information coded by the conjunctive activation of more than a few parallel fibers will be spatially and temporally dispersed in such a manner that successive postsynaptic Purkinje cells will receive very different combinations of inputs.

Response maps of 49 type IV neurons in cat dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) were studied by moving a tone in small steps along the frequency dimension and along the intensity dimension. Type IV responses are recorded from DCN principal cells. Data were collected from 38 units with best frequencies (BFs) from 2.16 to 50.3 kHz with the use of electrode penetrations along the long (strial) axis of the DCN; an additional 11 units from a previous study were analyzed. A stereotypical type IV response map is defined as consisting of two excitatory and two inhibitory regions. Type IV units from both the pyramidal cell layer (probably pyramidal cells) and the deep layer (probably giant cells) show the same types of response maps. 2. Two of the regions, one excitatory and one inhibitory, are seen in all type IV units. These regions are a low-threshold excitatory region at best frequency (BFER) and an inhibitory area at higher levels, usually centered below BF but extending upward in frequency to include BF (central inhibitory area, or CIA). The high resolution of the response maps in this paper allows us to show that type IV units fall into two groups on the basis of whether their CIAs are narrow with well-defined borders (35 units) or broad with poorly defined borders (14 units). 3. Two additional features of type IV response maps can be defined, most consistently in units with well-defined CIAs. These features are an excitatory region along the high-frequency edge of the CIA (upper excitatory region, UER) and an upper inhibitory sideband (UIS). The BFER and UER are continuous in many units, but in some cases their continuity is broken by the CIA. It seems likely that the BFER and UER represent a single excitatory input to type IV units and are revealed because the tuning curve of the stronger inhibitory inputs that produce the CIA has thresholds greater than and BFs lower than the excitatory inputs. 4. The CIA is probably produced by inhibitory inputs from DCN type II neurons. The bandwidths of type IV CIAs are about 1-3 times larger (at 40 dB above threshold) than the excitatory bandwidths of DCN type II units, suggesting a convergence of the equivalent in tuning of about two type II units onto each type IV unit.

The cell bodies of all identified TR(S)Ns were confined to the intermediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus (SC). The antidromic nature of the action potential evoked by stimulating either the PDB or C1 was verified by the use of a number of established criteria, including collision testing. 3.

In order to determine the sites in which IGF-I may play a role in neural development in vivo, the pattern of IGF-I gene expression in the developing rat brain has been analyzed by means of in situ hybridization histochemistry. Transient IGF-I gene expression is seen during the maturation of specific groups of functionally related sensory and cerebellar projection neurons. IGF-I mRNA is abundant within developing cerebellar Purkinje cells and in the major cerebellar relay centers, including the inferior olive, medial vestibular and lateral reticular nuclei of the brainstem, and the deep cerebellar and red nuclei. Similarly, IGF-I mRNA is localized in the synaptic stations of the developing olfactory, auditory, visual, and somatosensory systems. For example, in the auditory system, IGF-I mRNA is abundant in the cochlear nucleus, superior olive, lateral lemniscus, medial geniculate body, and inferior colliculus. In each system, IGF-I gene expression is found predominantly in long-axon projection neurons, appearing during a relatively late stage in their development, at a time of maturation of dendrites and synapse formation.

We found that the slow excitatory synaptic response evoked by 10-20 Hz electrical stimulation of primary afferent fibers consisted of two depolarizing components: an initial component lasting 1-5 s and a late one of 1-3 min duration. The initial and late components of the slow excitatory synaptic response can also be distinguished on the basis of their voltage-dependence and sensitivity to Mg2+ ions, kynurenate, D-APV and CNQX.

The responses of thalamocortical neurons to stimulation of mesopontine [peribrachial (PB) and laterodorsal (LDT)] cholinergic nuclei were studied intracellularly in urethan-anesthetized cats. Neurons recorded from anterior thalamic (AT), ventroanterior-ventrolateral (VA-VL) and rostral intralaminar centrolateral (CL) nuclei were physiologically identified by their orthodromic responses to prethalamic stimulation and/or antidromic activation from the cerebral cortex. 2. Besides early excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) that were not sensitive to cholinergic antagonists, two types of cholinergic responses were elicited by PB/LDT stimulation: a short-lasting and a late, long-lasting depolarization. All these components survived monoamine depletion by reserpine. 3. The latency of the short-lasting depolarizing response was 147.4 +/- 27.3 (SE) ms. The response lasted for 1.3 +/- 0.1 s and had a peak amplitude of 4.2 +/- 0.3 mV. This component was associated with 10-30% increase in membrane conductance and was abolished by systemic administration of the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. 4. The long-lasting depolarizing response had a latency of 1.2 +/- 0.1 s, a duration of 20.8 +/- 2.2 s, and a peak amplitude of 5.4 +/- 0.4 mV. Similar values were found in decorticated animals. The duration and amplitude of the late depolarizing component were dependent on stimulation parameters and membrane potential. This response increased under depolarizing current, decreased and eventually disappeared under hyperpolarizing current, and was associated on average with 40% increase in apparent input resistance. After systemic administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, the long-lasting depolarization disappeared; the surviving short-lasting depolarization was subsequently abolished by mecamylamine. 5. The prolonged depolarizing response of thalamocortical neurons to mesopontine cholinergic stimulation was accompanied by a desynchronization of the electroencephalogram (EEG). These two phenomena had a similar time course. Stimulation of deep cerebellar nuclei, whose axons traverse the PB area, did not induce a long-lasting depolarization of target thalamic cells, nor an EEG desynchronization. 6. These data demonstrate that, in addition to an initial nicotinic excitation, brain stem cholinergic stimulation elicits a late, long-lasting muscarinic depolarization of thalamocortical neurons.

Doses as low as 2.5 micrograms.kg-1 are reported to create deep levels of anesthesia as demonstrated by EEG changes to high-amplitude delta-waves. However, there are no reports concerning the effects of sufentanil on blood flow and metabolism in the human brain. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of high-dose sufentanil-O2 anesthesia on the cerebral circulation, metabolism, and the cerebrovascular response to CO2 in man. METHODS. Nine male and 2 female patients between 41 and 60 years of age who were scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were studied. Premedication consisted of flunitrazepam 2 mg orally and piritramide 15 mg and promethazine 50 mg i.m. 1 h before arrival in the induction room. Measurements were performed with the patients awake (I), after sufentanil 10 micrograms.kg-1 as an induction dose followed by 0.15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 as an infusion with normocapnia (pa CO2 42.1 +/- 2 mmHg) (II), during hypercapnia (pa CO2 53.7 +/- 3.5 mmHg) (III), and during hypocapnia (pa CO2 31.7 +/- 2 mmHg) (IV). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using the argon wash-in technique. Cerebral venous blood was obtained from a catheter in the superior bulb of the right internal jugular vein. Cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen (CMRO2) glucose (Mgluc) lactate (CMlac) were calculated by multiplying the arterial-cerebral venous oxygen and substrate differences by CBF. The Anaerobic Index was calculated from the equation avD lactate x 100/2 x avD glucose = ANI (%) Cerebral electrical activity was recorded by aperiodic analysis of the EEG (Lifescan). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. In the EEG sufentanil anesthesia was characterized by a decrease in the number of high-frequency waves and an increase in the number and amplitude of delta-waves, a pattern that did not change throughout the study period. Concomitantly, under normocapnic conditions high-dose sufentanil led to the significant decrease in CBF by 29% accompanied by an 18% increase in cerebral vascular resistance (CVR). CMRO2 decreased by 22% while CMRgluc and CMRlac changed only insignificantly such that the ANI, which represents the percentage of anaerobically metabolized glucose, essentially remained unchanged. Mean perfusion pressure declined by 18% but stayed within the range of autoregulation. Hypoventilation (III) was followed by an 82% increase in CBF as a result of a 55% reduction in CVR, whereas cerebral metabolic parameters did not show important changes when compared to measurement II. Hyperventilation (IV), on the other hand, produced a distinct fall in CBF by 56% to a value that was 21% below the one obtained under normocapnia. This was due to an increase in CVR of the same magnitude. There was a 31% rise in CMRO2, resulting in a decrease in cerebral venous oxygen tension, but in no case did it fall below the critical value of 20 mmHg at which tissue hypoxia becomes severe. Although CMRlac increased and CMRgluc did not significantly change, the ANI remained essentially unchanged, which suggests a predominantly aerobic metabolism. The increase in metabolic activity with sufentanil during hypocapnia might be caused by an alkalosis-induced stimulation of glycolysis. It might also be related to a reduction in the depth of anesthesia, although neither the EEG nor the hemodynamic parameters indicated this. This study shows that the coupling between CBF and metabolism is well maintained and that the cerebrovascular response to CO2 is unimpaired during high-dose sufentanil anesthesia.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Polarity reversal of N20 and P23 somatosensory evoked potentials between scalp and depth recordings.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "2338885", "authors": ["Vanderzant, CW", "Beydoun, AA", "Domer, PA", "Hood, TW", "Abou-Khalil, BW"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "From depth and scalp electrodes, we recorded MN-SSEPs of a 33-year-old man with right parietal dysfunction and refractory right temporal seizures.

We investigated the susceptibility of different parts of the piriform cortex to the development of electrical kindling as compared to that of the basolateral amygdala. A locus in the deep cell layer (layer III) of the rostral portion of the posterior piriform cortex (PPC) is described, which is considerably more sensitive to electrical stimulation than adjacent areas of the PPC, including the deep prepiriform cortex or the amygdala. The sensitive locus in the PPC can be readily kindled, and focal seizure thresholds in fully kindled rats are 60-90% lower than respective thresholds in rats kindled from other loci. Treatment of fully kindled rats with antiepileptic drugs diazepam, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and valproate showed that anticonvulsant effects of these drugs in animals kindled from stimulation of the PPC were comparable to respective effects in animals kindled from stimulation of the basolateral amygdala, although the locus in the PPC tended to be more resistant. The data support the idea that the piriform area may contain the most sensitive neuronal tissue responsible for the generation of seizures during kindling. It remains to be determined if the described locus in the PPC is critical to the kindling process when kindling is induced from other structures within the olfactory-limbic system.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Neuronal activity of the septum transplanted into the neocortical barrel field of the rat.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "65285", "authors": ["Kitchigina, VF", "Vinogradova, OS", "Bragin, AG"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "abstract": "Embryonic (E16-17) septal solid grafts were transplanted into acute cavities in the barrel field of somatosensory neocortex of adult rats. Extracellular recording of the graft's neuronal activity was performed in lightly anesthetized rats, or in brain slices in vitro 8-10 months after grafting. Analysis of Nissl and Golgi-Cox stained preparations showed that 81% of the grafts survived. Judging by combined histological and electrophysiological criteria, 69% of surviving grafts were integrated with the host brain. All septal grafts contained neurons with high spontaneous activity (mean 14.9 \u00b1 8.3 spikes \u00b7 s -1). Irregular bursts or rhythmic theta-bursts were present in background activity. The frequency of theta-bursts varied in parallel with the state of the animal from 3 Hz (deep barbiturate sleep) up to 7-8 Hz (arousal). Somatosensory stimulation evoked initial bursts or suppression of activity, often followed by a period of rhythmic theta-bursts. Though a high level of convergence for stimulation of vibrissae and body surface was typical of the grafted neurons, a certain spatial gradient of body representation was present. Many neurons responded also by initial burst or prolonged suppression of activity to electrical stimulation of thalamus and homolateral motor cortex. In the frontal slices of neocortex the neurons of septal grafts were highly reactive to stimulation of adjacent neocortex, but usually when the distance between the stimulating electrodes and the graft border did not exceed 1-1.5 mm. The data obtained in the septal slices are compared to the results described earlier in homotopic neocortical and heterotopic hippocampal grafts to the barrel field. It is concluded that heterotopic embryonic septal grafts can successfully develop and establish functional afferent connections with the host brain. Their neurons can participate in processing of sensory information, appropriate to the substituted cortical area, though the characteristics of responses are to a great extent determined by intrinsic properties of the septal neurons.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "84", "title": "Effects of torque disturbances on elbow joint movements evoked in unanesthetized cats by microstimulation of the motor cortex.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "359950", "authors": ["Kostyukov, AI", "Tal'nov, AN"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Pulse trains with duration up to 3-4 s, current intensities of 15-50 microA and rates of approximately 100/s were used. Cortically evoked movements (CEMs) were tested mechanically by applying servo-controlled torque disturbances to the joint. The disturbances consisted of two reciprocating sinusoidal pulses of torque with fixed frequencies (1.2 or 3.2 Hz). A pronounced torque-angle hysteresis with long-lasting after-effects was revealed in the presence of the torque disturbances that opposed the CEMs and/or assisted them. Two parameters were introduced to describe the mechanical testing of the CEMs quantitatively: (1) the resulting stiffness (RS) defined during the forward and reverse phases of the disturbed movement as a ratio between the amplitudes of torque wave and the overall change of angle at these phases; (2) uncertainty index (UI) defined as the subtraction of forward and reverse angle changes, which was normalized by the first of these two values. RS was shown to be dependent on the immediate past movement history of the joint, it increased with changes in the direction of movement, and its magnitude during such changes could be several times higher than when the disturbance was in the same direction as the movement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Seizure interactions between the inferior collicular cortex and the deep prepiriform cortex.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "4313504", "authors": ["McCown, TJ", "Breese, GR"], "year": "", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "In rats, electrographic seizure activity was recorded from both the inferior collicular cortex and the deep prepiriform after i.p. administration of 15 mumol/kg bicuculline, a dose which produced a variety of seizure behaviors. electrographic spikes recorded from the deep prepiriform cortex coincided with myoclonic jerks, while both brain areas exhibited an increase in afterdischarge frequency at the onset of forelimb tonic extension. Conversely, afterdischarge activity was recorded in both brain regions, while no seizure behaviors were apparent, providing examples of dissociation between electrographic and behavioral seizure activity. However, when functional interactions were assessed, the tonic-clonic behaviors produced by kindling stimulation of the inferior collicular cortex were prevented by microinjections of procaine into the deep prepiriform cortex.

In both kinds of preparation TDI was more pronounced in neurones recorded in the deep dorsal horn and in the ventral horn than in those recorded in the superficial dorsal horn. There was a tendency in the whole sample for TDI to be greater in neurones with input from inflamed knees.

The technique, developed at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom, is being increasingly used for both clinical studies and basic research, with some 500 stimulators presently in use worldwide. This paper looks at the development of magnetic stimulation as a clinical tool. The basic physics principles of the technique are outlined, and the different magnetic field waveforms, coil geometrics, and orientations that can be used are discussed. The depth of penetration of magnetic stimulation is compared to that of conventional electrical stimulation using surface electrodes. It is shown that the former generates lower electric fields at the surface of the body, resulting in greater penetration and the ability to stimulate deep nerves without pain. Magnetic stimulation has several other advantages over electrical stimulation, including being able to stimulate the human brain without discomfort due to the magnetic fields passing through the skull without attenuation. These advantages, along with the limitations of the technique, are discussed. Finally, data relating to the safety of brain stimulation are summarised in terms of the electromagnetic parameters used. It is concluded that the present generation of magnetic stimulators do not cause acute hazards, provided their electrical and mechanical design meets the relevant electromedical safety standards.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Technical and practical aspects of magnetic nerve stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "1473011", "authors": ["Jalinous, R"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "Magnetic stimulators consist of a high-voltage (400 V to more than 3 kV), high-current (4 kA to more than 20 kA) discharge system producing a brief pulse of magnetic field (1-10 T lasting up to a few milliseconds). In order to ensure safety and reliability, care has to be taken in the construction of magnetic stimulators and especially their stimulating coils, which may come into contact with the patient, by the use of adequate mechanical and electrical insulation and the incorporation of sensors to monitor temperature, voltage, etc. Where possible, equipment should be manufactured to comply with safety standards such as UL504 and IEC601. The effectiveness of a magnetic stimulator depends on many parameters such as the maximization of the peak coil energy, fast magnetic field rise times, and good coil design. It is also important to choose a coil based on its intended clinical application and not simply on account of its high magnetic field strength. A small coil, producing a high surface magnetic field, is suitable in the stimulation of superficial nerves, whereas a larger coil, with a low magnetic field intensity, may well be more suitable for the stimulation of deep nerves. Double, figure-eight, or butterfly coils produce more localised induced currents allowing for more selective stimulation. The exposure of the brain to high magnetic field strengths can also be reduced by using larger coils.", "pages": "263-74"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Tectal induction of cortical arousal: evidence implicating multiple output pathways.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "1467972", "authors": ["Dean, P", "Simkins, M", "Hetherington, L", "Mitchell, IJ", "Redgrave, P"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "The rodent superior colliculus mediates a wide range of physiological and behavioural responses to sudden stimuli, including desynchronisation of the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG).

Microinjections at sites widely distributed throughout all layers of the superior colliculus were able to desynchronise the cortical EEG. i) In the superficial layers, bicuculline was effective at more sites than glutamate, whereas the reverse was true for the deep layers. ii) At some sites EEG desynchronisation occurred together with the defensive or orienting movements that are obtained from collicular stimulation in awake animals. At other sites cortical arousal occurred without such movements. iii) Comparison with a previous study suggested that urethane selectively blocks cortical arousal to glutamate injections in the superficial and intermediate grey layers.
