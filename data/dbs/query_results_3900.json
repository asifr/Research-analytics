These benefits have been demonstrated to be sustained for up to 7 years. DBS has also been shown to be beneficial for the tremor associated with multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic tremor; however, fewer cases have been reported and the benefit is less consistent, less dramatic, and more transient than that seen with ET. The ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is the most common DBS target for tremor disorders, but more recent studies have demonstrated benefits in tremor from DBS of the subthalamic area, primarily the zona incerta. Surgical complications are relatively uncommon and are generally less frequent than those seen with thalamotomy.

Despite its remarkable clinical success, the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS are still not completely understood, limiting opportunities to improve treatment efficacy and simplify selection of stimulation parameters. This review addresses three questions essential to understanding the mechanisms of DBS. 1) How does DBS affect neuronal tissue in the vicinity of the active electrode or electrodes? 2) How do these changes translate into therapeutic benefit on motor symptoms? 3) How do these effects depend on the particular site of stimulation? Early hypotheses proposed that stimulation inhibited neuronal activity at the site of stimulation, mimicking the outcome of ablative surgeries. Recent studies have challenged that view, suggesting that although somatic activity near the DBS electrode may exhibit substantial inhibition or complex modulation patterns, the output from the stimulated nucleus follows the DBS pulse train by direct axonal excitation. The intrinsic activity is thus replaced by high-frequency activity that is time-locked to the stimulus and more regular in pattern. These changes in firing pattern are thought to prevent transmission of pathologic bursting and oscillatory activity, resulting in the reduction of disease symptoms through compensatory processing of sensorimotor information. Although promising, this theory does not entirely explain why DBS improves motor symptoms at different latencies. Understanding these processes on a physiological level will be critically important if we are to reach the full potential of this powerful tool.", "pages": "367-78"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Objective monitoring of tremor and bradykinesia during DBS surgery for Parkinson disease.", "issue": "15", "pmid": "10401777", "authors": ["Papapetropoulos, S", "Jagid, JR", "Sengun, C", "Singer, C", "Gallo, BV"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Fifteen years after its resurrection, pallidotomy for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia has once again been supplanted, this time by deep brain stimulation (DBS).

This review focuses on the evidence-and its quality-supporting the effectiveness and safety of pallidotomy for PD and dystonia, and the comparative effectiveness and safety of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi). Discussed first are the determinants of \"level 1\" recommendations, including the confounding effects on interpretation of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that fail to control for patient bias (i.e., placebo effects). Although several RCTs have been performed comparing unilateral pallidotomy to medical therapy, GPi DBS, or STN DBS for PD, none controlled for patient bias. Comparison of these trials to estimate the placebo effect, and examination of retrospective case series, suggests that the true effectiveness of unilateral pallidotomy is 20% to 30% reduction of 'off' total motor UPDRS scores, which is similar to the effects of unilateral GPi DBS or STN DBS, but less than bilateral STN DBS. At experienced centers, safety of unilateral pallidotomy appears equivalent to unilateral DBS, but bilateral DBS is likely safer than bilateral pallidotomy. Whereas there have been no RCTs of pallidotomy for dystonia, two double-blind, sham-controlled RCTs of bilateral GPi DBS were performed. Nevertheless, limited uncontrolled series suggest that bilateral pallidotomy is similar to GPi DBS in effectiveness and safety for dystonia. Thus, pallidotomy was not rejected because of lack of effectiveness or safety, and it remains a viable alternative in situations where DBS is not available or not feasible.", "pages": "367-78"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Tremor varies as a function of the temporal regularity of deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "10413327", "authors": ["Birdno, MJ", "Kuncel, AM", "Dorval, AD", "Turner, DA", "Grill, WM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neuroreport", "abstract": "After nearly 20 years of preclinical experimentation with various gene delivery approaches in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), clinical trials are finally underway. The risk/benefit ratio for these procedures is now generally considered acceptable under approved protocols. The current vehicle for gene delivery to the human brain is recombinant adeno-associated viral vector, which is nonpathogenic and non-self-amplifying. Candidate genes tested in PD patients encode 1) glutamic acid decarboxylase, which is injected into the subthalamic nucleus to catalyze biosynthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid and so essentially mimic deep brain stimulation of this nucleus; 2) aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase, which converts l-dopa to dopamine; and 3) neurturin, a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family. Unraveling the genetic underpinnings of PD could allow gene therapy to go beyond modulating neurotransmission or providing trophic effects to dopaminergic neurons by delivering a specific missing or defective gene. For example, the parkin gene (PARK2) is linked to recessively inherited PD due to loss of function mutations; it prevents alpha-synuclein-induced degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons in rats and nonhuman primates. On the other hand, for dominantly inherited Huntington's disease (HD), in which an expanded polyglutamine tract imparts to the protein huntingtin a toxic gain of function, repressing expression of the mutant allele in the striatum using RNA interference technology mitigates pathology and delays the phenotype in a mouse model.

This modulation appears to depend on the presence of alpha and beta GABA(A)R subunits, whose distinct expression in dorsal and ventral hippocampus has been recently shown. Using population spike recordings from the CA1 area of dorsal (DHS) and ventral (VHS) hippocampal slices we compared the effects of seven sedative/anesthetic drugs (diazepam, midazolam, phenobarbital, propofol, pentobarbital, thiopental and alfaxalone) on the GABAergic recurrent inhibition (RI) between the two hippocampal poles. The strength and duration of RI was quantified by measuring an antidromic stimulation-induced suppression of the orthodromic population spike at varying inter-pulse intervals. All drugs enhanced RI in both DHS and VHS but high concentrations of barbiturates and alfaxalone prolonged RI considerably more compared to benzodiazepines or low doses of barbiturates and propofol. Furthermore, the drug-induced prolongation of RI was significantly greater in DHS than in VHS. Thus, RI was enhanced by thiopental (50 microM), alfaxalone (2.5 microM) and pentobarbital (50 microM) up to 150 ms, 150 ms and 270 ms respectively in DHS, and up to 70 ms, 100 ms and 150 ms respectively in VHS. In addition, under GABA(B) receptor blockade, thiopental (100 microM) and alfaxalone (10 microM) prolonged GABA(A)R-mediated RI significantly more in DH (up to 900 ms) than in VH (up to 430 ms and 600 ms respectively). This finding provides support to the notion of diversification of intrinsic organization along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus.

FMRI was found a reliable and reproducible examination tool resulting in a wide distribution of fMRI methods in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy in determining the relationship of eloquent areas and the epileptic focus. Preliminary data suggest that fMRI using memory paradigms can predict the postoperative memory decline in epilepsy surgery by determining whether a reorganization of memory functions took place. Speech-activated fMRI became the most used tool in determining hemispheric dominance. Visual and sensory-motor cortex can also be routinely investigated by fMRI which helps in decision on epilepsy surgery. FMRI combined with EEG is a new diagnostic tool in epilepsy and sleep disorders. FMRI can identify the penumbra after stroke and can provide an additional information on metabolic state of the threatened brain tissue. FMRI has a predictive role in post-stroke recovery. In relapsing-remitting MS an adaptive reorganization can be demonstrated by fMRI affecting the visual, motor, and memory systems, despite preserved functional performance. Much more extensive reorganization can be demonstrated in secondary progressive MS. These findings suggest that the different stages of MS are related to different stages of the reorganization and MS becomes progressive when there is no more reserve capacity in the brain for reorganization. FMRI offers the capability of detecting early functional hemodynamic alterations in Alzheimer's disease before morphological changes.

To this end, an electroencephalogram was recorded simultaneously from scalp and thalamic electrodes in seven patients undergoing deep brain stimulation. Meanwhile, left- or right-directed precues were presented indicating with which index finger a button press should be putatively executed. Thereafter, 2 sec elapsed until a go or no-go stimulus determined if the prepared movement had to be performed or withheld. In fronto-central scalp as well as in thalamic recordings, event-related potentials upon go versus no-go instructions were expressed differentially. This task effect was unrelated to motor processes and emerged significantly prior at thalamic than at scalp level.

Given these observations, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of STN DBS on parkinsonian motor signs remains under debate. One hypothesis suggests that abnormal levels of bursting activity in the pallidum play a key role in the development of parkinsonian motor signs and that STN DBS may exert its beneficial effect by modifying this type of activity. We quantified the changes in bursting activity of globus pallidus internus (GPi) and externus (GPe) neurons before and during ineffective (subtherapeutic) and effective (therapeutic) STN DBS in two monkeys rendered parkinsonian by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Compared to pre-stimulation control values, the population mean firing rate increased during therapeutic stimulation significantly in both GPe (from 41.7 Hz+/-2.8 to 71.4 Hz+/-7.8) and GPi (from 58.8 Hz+/-4.2 to 71.5 Hz+/-6.2). The burst rate, however, increased significantly in GPe (from 80.1 bursts/min+/-10.0 to 103.1 bursts/min+/-11.1) and decreased significantly in GPi (from 104.2 bursts/min+/-8.3 to 75.8 bursts/min+/-10.8). Although both animals showed improvement in parkinsonian motor signs, changes in rate and bursting activity in GPi were significant only in one animal. These data suggest that while changes in rate and bursting activity may contribute to the improvement in PD motor signs during STN DBS, one cannot explain the therapeutic effects of stimulation in all cases solely on changes in these parameters.

In contrast to the well known excitation spread in the horizontal direction in layer II/III induced in the barrel cortex by layer IV stimulation, the excitation caused in the insular cortex by stimulation of layer IV spread bidirectionally in the vertical direction into layers II/III and V/VI, displaying a columnar image pattern. Bicuculline or picrotoxin markedly extended the horizontal excitation spread in layer II/III in the barrel cortex, leading to a generation of excitation in the underlying layer V/VI, whereas those markedly increased the amplitude of optical responses throughout the whole column in the insular cortex, subsequently widening the columnar image pattern. Such synchronous activities as revealed by the horizontal and vertical excitation spreads were consistently induced in the barrel and insular cortices, respectively, even by stimulation of different layers with varying intensities. Thus, a unique functional column existed in the insular cortex, in which intracolumnar communication between the superficial and deep layers was prominent, and GABA(A) action is involved in the inhibition of the intracolumnar communication in contrast to its involvement in intercolumnar lateral inhibition in the barrel cortex.

Here, we investigate the pattern of bidirectional coupling between mesial and lateral cortical areas and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) at rest and during movement, with and without pharmacological dopaminergic input, in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Our results show (1) asymmetric bidirectional coupling between STN and both mesial and lateral cortical areas with greater drives from cortex to STN at frequencies <35 Hz, (2) a drop of beta band coupling driven from mesial cortex to STN during movement, and (3) an increase in symmetrical bidirectional drives between STN and mesial cortex and in lateral cortical drive to STN in the gamma band after dopaminergic therapy.

The aim of this study was to examine the neurophysiology of the human PPN region and to identify neurophysiological landmarks that may aid the proper placement of DBS electrodes in the nucleus for the treatment of PD and PSP. Neuronal firing and local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from two independently driven microelectrodes during stereotactic neurosurgery for implantation of a unilateral DBS electrode in the PPN in five PD patients and two PSP patients. Within the PPN region, the majority (57%) of the neurons fired randomly while about 21% of the neurons exhibited 'bursty' firing. In addition, 21% of the neurons had a long action potential duration and significantly lower firing rate suggesting they were cholinergic neurons. A change in firing rate produced by passive and/or active contralateral limb movement was observed in 38% of the neurons that were tested in the PPN region. Interestingly, oscillatory local field potential activity in the beta frequency range ( approximately 25 Hz) was also observed in the PPN region. These electrophysiological characteristics of the PPN region provide further support for the proposed role of this region in motor control.
