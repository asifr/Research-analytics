Further research using this causal neuromodulatory tool may provide vital insights into fundamental brain function, as well as guide targets for future treatments. In particular, DBS could have an important role in restoring the balance of the brain's default network and thus repairing the malignant brain states associated with affective disorders, which give rise to serious disabling problems such as anhedonia, the lack of pleasure.

We then assigned clinical outcome scores to each VTA and compiled all of the VTAs into a PSA to identify stimulation-induced activation targets that maximized therapeutic response with minimal side effects.

Primary dystonia is associated with several genotypes. Among those, DYT1 and DYT6 are inherited in autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance. Extensive structural and functional imaging studies have been performed on manifesting and non-manifesting carriers of these mutations. The results suggest that primary dystonia can be viewed as a neurodevelopmental circuit disorder, involving the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical and cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways. Anatomical disruption of the cerebellar outflow is found in non-manifesting and manifesting mutation carriers, and a second downstream disruption in thalamo-cortical projections appears clinically protective in non-manifesting carriers. The microstructural deficits in cerebellar outflow are linked to an abnormally elevated sensorimotor network (NMRP) in dystonia patients.

This might indicate that DBS speeds up both motor and nonmotor operations. Therefore, we studied the extent to which modifications of different processing streams could explain changes of RT under subthalamic DBS. Ten PD patients on-DBS and off-DBS and 10 healthy subjects performed a choice-response task (CRT), requiring either right or left finger button presses. At the same time, EEG recordings were performed, so that RTs could be assessed together with lateralized readiness potentials (LRP), indicative of movement preparation. Additionally, an oddball task (OT) was run, in which right finger responses to target stimuli were recorded along with cognitive P300 responses. Generally, PD patients off-DBS had longer RTs than controls. Subthalamic DBS accelerated RT only in CRT. This could largely be explained by analog shortenings of LRP. No DBS-dependent changes were identified in OT, neither on the level of RT nor on the level of P300 latencies. It follows that RT accelerations under DBS of the STN are predominantly due to effects on the timing of motor instead of nonmotor processes. This starting point explains why DBS gains of response speed are low in tasks in which reactions are initiated from an advanced level of movement preparation (as in OT), and high whenever motor responses have to be raised from scratch (as in CRT).", "pages": "1070-9"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Prevalence of Twiddler's syndrome as a cause of deep brain stimulation hardware failure.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "15260916", "authors": ["Burdick, AP", "Okun, MS", "Haq, IU", "Ward, HE", "Bova, F", "Jacobson, CE", "Bowers, D", "Zeilman, P", "Foote, KD"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "To provide recommendations to patients, physicians, and other health care providers on several issues involving deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD).", "pages": "1070-9"}, {"volume": "133", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus stimulation influences expression and suppression of impulsive behaviour in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "Pt 12", "pmid": "15390210", "authors": ["Wylie, SA", "Ridderinkhof, KR", "Elias, WJ", "Frysinger, RC", "Bashore, TR", "Downs, KE", "van Wouwe, NC", "van den Wildenberg, WP"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "An international consortium of experts organized, reviewed the literature, and attended the workshop.

The PPN is a posterior midbrain site known to induce locomotion in decerebrate animals when activated at 40-60\u00a0Hz, and has become a target for DBS in disorders involving gait deficits. We developed a research program using brainstem slices containing the PPN to study the cellular and molecular organization of this region. We showed that PPN neurons preferentially fire at gamma band frequency (30-60\u00a0Hz) when maximally activated, accounting for the effects of electrical stimulation. In addition, we developed the P13 midlatency auditory evoked potential, which is generated by PPN outputs, in freely moving rats. This allows the study of PPN cellular and molecular mechanisms in the whole animal. We also study the P50 midlatency auditory evoked potential, which is the human equivalent of the rodent P13 potential, allowing us to study PPN-related processes detected in vitro, confirmed in the whole animal, and tested in humans. Previous findings on the P50 potential in PD suggest that PPN output in this disorder is overactive. This translational research program led to the discovery of a novel mechanism of sleep-wake control based on electrical coupling, pointing the way to a number of new clinical applications in the development of novel stimulants (e.g., modafinil) and anesthetics.
