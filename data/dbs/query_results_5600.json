Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is a promising new procedure for the treatment of dystonia. The authors present their technical approach for placement of electrodes into the GPi in awake patients with dystonia, including the methodology used for electrophysiological mapping of the GPi in the dystonic state, clinical outcomes and complications, and the location of electrodes associated with optimal benefit. Methods. Twenty-three adult and pediatric patients who had various forms of dystonia were included in this study. Baseline neurological status and improvement in motor function resulting from DBS were measured using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Implantation of the DBS lead was performed using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based stereotaxy, single-cell microelectrode recording, and intraoperative test stimulation to determine thresholds for stimulation-induced adverse effects. Electrode locations were measured on computationally reformatted postoperative MR images according to a prospective protocol. Conclusions. Physiologically guided implantation of DBS electrodes in patients with dystonia is technically feasible in the awake state in most cases, with low morbidity rates. Spontaneous discharge rates of GPi neurons in dystonia are similar to those of globus pallidus externus neurons, such that the two nuclei must be distinguished by neuronal discharge patterns rather than by rates. Active electrode locations associated with robust improvement (> 50% decrease in BFMDRS score) were located near the intercommissural plane, at a mean distance of 3.7 mm from the pallidocapsular border. Patients with juvenile-onset primary dystonia and those with the tardive form benefited greatly from this procedure, whereas benefits for most secondary dystonias and the adult-onset craniocervical form of this disorder were more modest.", "pages": "E5"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for hyperkinetic disorders.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15264770", "authors": ["Montgomery, EB"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can relieve dyskinesias effectively and safely.

Clinical evidence that electrical stimulation could interfere with seizure activity was initially reported in the 1930's. However, many of these early studies consisted of case reports or were poorly controlled. In addition, there were a number of studies that failed to observe any beneficial effect of brain stimulation on seizures. More recently, deep brain stimulation has been used successfully to treat patients with movement disorders and vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to effectively decrease seizure activity in a select population of epilepsy patients.

There is now experimental and clinical evidence that direct electrical stimulation of the brain can prevent or decrease seizure activity. However, several fundamental questions remain to be resolved. They include where in the brain the stimulus should be delivered and what type of stimulation would be most effective.

Clinically, stimulation of the subthalamic area at similar high frequencies reverses parkinsonism and forms the basis of therapeutic deep brain stimulation in PD. The results point to a possible common mechanism by which both dopaminergic treatment associated synchronisation of subthalamic activity at very high frequency and synchronisation imposed by therapeutic stimulation of the subthalamic area inhibit an abnormal and potentially deleterious synchronisation of basal ganglia output at around 20 Hz.

Both STN DBS and medication reduced the amplitude, regularity and tremor-EMG coherence, and increased the EMG frequency of resting and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease. STN DBS was more effective than medication in reducing the amplitude and increasing the frequency of resting and postural tremor to healthy physiological levels.

These pauses were much longer in the absence than in the presence of background inputs applied with dynamic clamping. We found that a significant amount of the synaptic current elicited by electrical stimulation was shunted by the background inputs.

Studies in subthalamic nucleus and other brain sites have emphasized non-synaptic factors. To explore the mechanism underlying thalamic DBS, we simulated DBS in vitro by applying high-frequency (125 Hz) electrical stimulation directly into the sensorimotor thalamus of adult rat brain slices. Intracellular recordings revealed two distinct types of membrane responses, both of which were initiated with a depolarization and rapid spike firing. However, type 1 responses repolarized quickly and returned to quiescent baseline during simulated DBS whereas type 2 responses maintained the level of membrane depolarization, with or without spike firing. Individual thalamic neurones exhibited either type 1 or type 2 response but not both. In all neurones tested, simulated DBS-evoked membrane depolarization was reversibly eliminated by tetrodotoxin, glutamate receptor antagonists, and the Ca(2+) channel antagonist Cd(2+). Simulated DBS also increased the excitability of thalamic cells in the presence of glutamate receptor blockade, although this non-synaptic effect induced no spontaneous firing such as that found in subthalamic nucleus neurones. Our data suggest that high-frequency stimulation when applied in the ventral thalamus can rapidly disrupt local synaptic function and neuronal firing thereby leading to a 'functional deafferentation' and/or 'functional inactivation'. These mechanisms, driven primarily by synaptic activation, help to explain the paradox that lesions, muscimol and DBS in thalamus all effectively stop tremor.", "pages": "E5"}, {"volume": "1013", "title": "High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus reverses limb-use asymmetry in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11287459", "authors": ["Shi, LH", "Woodward, DJ", "Luo, F", "Anstrom, K", "Schallert, T", "Chang, JY"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The surgical treatment of epilepsy is expanding in an exciting and unprecedented way.

The present study tested DBS effects on limb-use asymmetry (LUA) during vertical/lateral exploration in a cylindrical chamber in rats with similar unilateral nigrostriatal DA lesions. Limb-use asymmetry assessment has been used to detect functional capacity over a wide range of dopamine depletion.

After unilateral nigrostriatal DA lesioning, rats displayed reduced rearing activity and predominant use of the ipsilateral (good) forelimb to touch the wall. HFS of the STN, but not of other nearby regions surrounding the STN, in the lesioned rats restored normal rearing activity and reversed the limb-use asymmetry caused by the unilateral DA depletion.

The importance of the STN in motor function is evidenced by its involvement in Parkinson disease (PD). This nucleus has also been associated with the attentional and emotional aspects of motor behavior through its connections with the limbic and prefrontal areas of the brain. As lesions of the STN have been shown to increase premature responding in a serial reaction time task in rats, indicative of its involvement in cognitive performance, the present study aimed to investigate whether bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN, in non-lesioned rats, affects cognitive functions and whether these are dependent on certain stimulation parameters. Rats were trained in a choice reaction time task and implanted bilaterally with electrodes. Stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency and pulse width) were varied during the test procedure, after which rats were sacrificed and the brains processed for histochemical staining. Results show no change in reaction times or motor times during stimulation. However, a linear decrease in premature responses was observed with decreasing amplitudes and at high frequencies only. These results are the first to demonstrate that bilateral STN HFS has a positive effect on cognition in freely moving rats. This latter result is in contrast to findings following lesions of the STN, and suggests that current strength and frequency of stimulation are parameters that are integral to the mediation of stimulation effects. Furthermore, the overall effects of DBS on neuronal cells cannot be classified simply as being \"inhibitory\" and evidently mediates its effects by more complex mechanisms than lesions of the same brain area.", "pages": "E5"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "The future of deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "8531195", "authors": ["Kopell, BH", "Greenberg, B", "Rezai, AR"], "year": "", "journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "abstract": "In this study the role of DBS in advanced Parkinson disease (PD) is re-evaluated and new indications in the field of movement disorders are explored.

The primate GPi is composed of a majority of neurons endowed with a highly collateralized axon that projects to the premotor neurons located in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei, the center-m\u00e9dian/parafascicular thalamic complex and the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus. These axons often follow a long and tortuous course within the GPi and then emerge either through the ansa lenticularis (AL) or the lenticular fasciculus (LF), irrespective of the location of their parent cell body in the GPi. Other pallidofugal axons exit through the medial pole of the GPi, at various distances between the AL ventrally and the LF dorsally. Virtually all pallidofugal axons course through Forel's field H, on their way to the thalamus and brainstem. They emit numerous short collaterals and boutons en passant in this sector of the subthalamic region, which stands out as a major target of GPi axons. Our results indicate that AL and LF do not form separate anatomical entities, each carrying axons originating from distinct functional pallidal territories, as commonly believed. Instead, these two fascicles form the ventral and dorsal borders of a morphological continuum that harbors a multitude of pallidofugal axons arising from all sectors of the GPi.

Using a computational model, this paper considers the hypothesis that DBS works by replacing pathologically rhythmic basal ganglia output with tonic, high frequency firing. In our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals. High frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result. We provide a mathematical phase plane analysis of the mechanisms that determine TC relay capabilities in normal, parkinsonian, and DBS states in a reduced model. This analysis highlights the differences in deinactivation of the low-threshold calcium T -current that we observe in TC cells in these different conditions. Alternative scenarios involving convergence of thalamic signals in the cortex are also discussed, and predictions associated with these results, including the occurrence of rhythmic rebound bursts in certain TC cells in parkinsonian states and their drastic reduction by DBS, are stated.

It is no surprise that DBS is now being studied in the treatment of refractory psychiatric disease. Deep brain stimulation has inherent advantages over previous lesioning procedures. It is fully reversible, and stimulation can be adjusted according to a patient's changing symptoms and disease progression. Coupled with the fact that the stimulation can generally be turned on or off without the patient's awareness, DBS provides a unique opportunity for double-blinding studies. To undertake DBS for psychiatric conditions, appropriate surgical targets must be chosen. What is most strongly supported is the role of cortico-striato-thalamocortical (CSTC) loops in the pathophysiology of psychiatric symptoms. Recent functional imaging studies have consistently found evidence that corroborate this model of psychiatric symptom pathogenesis. Based on the psychiatric and cognitive effects seen in recent movement disorder surgery, it is apparent that modulation of neural systems subserving psychiatric phenomenon can be accomplished by DBS. The few published studies on DBS for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suggest that this can be done safely.

In addition, new clinical applications of DBS for other neurologic and psychiatric disorders (e.g., epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder) have been vaulted forward. Although DBS has been effective in the treatment of movement disorders and is rapidly being explored for the treatment of other neurologic disorders, the scientific understanding of its mechanisms of action remains unclear and continues to be debated in the scientific community. Optimization of DBS technology for present and future therapeutic applications will depend on identification of the therapeutic mechanism(s) of action. The goal of this review is to address the present knowledge of the effects of high frequency stimulation within the central nervous system and comment on the functional implications of this knowledge for uncovering the mechanism(s) of DBS. Four general hypotheses have been developed to explain the mechanism(s) of DBS: depolarization blockade, synaptic inhibition, synaptic depression, and stimulation-induced modulation of pathologic network activity.

However, in the recent past, this technique has been increasingly neglected and has been largely replaced by motor cortex stimulation (MCS). The results of MCS, however, are far from uniform, and the best reports quote a range of 50% to 75% success in providing satisfactory pain relief. In recent years, there has been considerable success in treating various movement disorders, particularly in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia, by chronic high-frequency DBS of nuclear structures in the basal ganglia. This technique has also been shown to be relatively effective in some selected cases of tremulous conditions like essential tremor and posttraumatic tremor. However, when the same techniques have been applied to patients with multiple sclerosis tremor (MST), the results have been mixed. As a result, DBS for MST has often been perceived as an unreliable and inconsistent therapeutic intervention. The authors present their experience with the application of DBS in these two relatively unpopular areas for neuromodulation in the current practice of functional stereotactic neurosurgery. The results demonstrate that with careful patient selection, DBS can offer significant functional benefit in both of these difficult clinical conditions.", "pages": "E5"}, {"volume": "100", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in a patient with levodopa-responsive multiple system atrophy.

In particular, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has widened the spectrum of therapeutical options for patients with otherwise intractable dystonia. It has been introduced only with a delay after DBS became an accepted treatment for advanced Parkinson' disease (PD). In this overview, the authors summarize the current status of its clinical application in dystonia. Deep brain stimulation for dystonia has been developed from radiofrequency lesioning, but it has replaced the latter largely in most centers. The main target used for primary dystonia is the posteroventral globus pallidus internus (GPi), and its efficacy has been shown in generalized dystonia, segmental dystonia, and complex cervical dystonia. The optimal target for secondary dystonias is still unclear, but some patients appear to benefit more from thalamic stimulation. The improvement of dystonia with chronic DBS frequently is delayed, in particular concerning tonic dystonic postures. Because more energy is needed for stimulation than in other movement disorders such as PD, more frequent battery replacements are necessary, which results in relatively higher costs for chronic DBS. The study of intraoperative microelectrode recordings and of local field potentials by the implanted DBS electrodes has yielded new insights in the pathophysiology of dystonia. Larger studies are underway presently to validate the observations being made.", "pages": "E5"}, {"volume": "100", "title": "Histological analysis of the location of effective thalamic stimulation for tremor.

It is considered a surgical treatment alternative for patients with intractable tremor or for those patients who are affected by long-term complications of levodopa therapy such as motor fluctuations and severe dyskinesias. Thalamic stimulation in the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) leads to a marked reduction of contralateral tremor but has no beneficial effect on other symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) are targeted for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. Several studies have proven the efficacy of STN-DBS and GPi-DBS in alleviating off motor symptoms and dyskinesias. Sub-thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation is currently considered superior to GPi-DBS because the antiakinetic effect seems to be more pronounced, allows a more marked reduction of antiparkinsonian medication, and requires less stimulation energy. More recently, however, a number of reports on possible psychiatric and behavioral side effects of STN-DBS have been a matter of concern. Given the chronic nature of PD and the noncurative approach of DBS, both targets will need to be reevaluated on the basis of their long-term efficacy and their impact on quality of life. Despite the rapidly increasing numbers of DBS procedures, surprisingly few controlled clinical trials are available that address important clinical issues such as: When should DBS be applied during the course of disease? Which patients should be selected? Which target should be considered? Which guidelines should be followed during postoperative care?

Multiple studies of DBS of the thalamus have shown that it is efficacious in the treatment of ET hand tremor, often with secondary improvement in voice and head tremor. Long-term studies have reported that a majority of patients continue to experience improvement in tremor. Adverse effects related to stimulation are usually mild and can be managed with changes in stimulation parameters. Long-term hardware complications include equipment malfunction, skin erosion, and battery replacements, which require additional surgery. Deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is a safe and efficacious procedure and should be considered in patients with ET who experience medication-resistant disabling tremor.", "pages": "E5"}]
