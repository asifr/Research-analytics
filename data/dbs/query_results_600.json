Over the past decade there have been many reports of TD patients experiencing significant benefit with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi). The growing literature on this treatment option for TD consists predominantly of case reports and series. The reported benefit ranges widely, but the majority of cases experienced at least a 50% improvement in symptoms. The anatomical distribution of dyskinesias has not clearly influenced outcome, though fixed postures appear less likely to improve than phasic movements. Onset of benefit can be immediate or take months, and benefit is sustained in most cases, for at least 6 months and up to several years. A wide variety of voltages, frequencies, and pulse widths have demonstrated efficacy. A small number of reports which examined psychiatric symptoms before and after surgery did not find any decline, and in some cases revealed improvement in mood. However, these overall positive results should be interpreted with caution, as the majority of reports lacked blinded assessments, control groups, or standardized therapy parameters. Finally, we present an illustrative case of refractory tardive dyskinesia treated with GPi-DBS with 5 years of follow-up and 4 accompanying video segments.", "pages": "141-7"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Imaging artifacts induced by electrical stimulation during conventional fMRI of the brain.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23099102", "authors": ["Antal, A", "Bikson, M", "Datta, A", "Lafon, B", "Dechent, P", "Parra, LC", "Paulus, W"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activation during transcranial electrical stimulation is used to provide insight into the mechanisms of neuromodulation and targeting of particular brain structures. However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp. The direction of change relative to non-stimulation reversed with tDCS stimulation polarity. For tACS there was no net effect of the MRI signal. High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation.

Cerebral activation revealed by positron emission tomography was compared among Parkinson patients with (PD-ON) or without (PD-OFF) STN stimulation, and a group of control subjects (CT) in two visual WM tasks with spatial (SP) and nonspatial (NSP) components. PD-OFF patients displayed significant reaction time (RT) deficits for both memory tasks. Although there were no significant differences in RT between patients with PD-ON and -OFF stimulation, patients with PD-ON stimulation performed comparably to controls. The memory tasks were executed with normal error rates in PD-ON and -OFF stimulation. In contrast to these behavioral results, whether the corresponding prefrontal activation was differentially affected by deep brain stimulation status in patients depended on whether the WM modality was SP versus NSP. Thus, SP WM was associated with (1) abnormal reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal activity in PD-OFF and -ON stimulation and (2) abnormal overactivation in parieto-temporal cortex in PD-OFF and in limbic circuits in PD-ON stimulation. In NSP WM, normal activation of the ventral prefrontal cortex was restored in PD-ON stimulation. In both visual modalities the posterior cerebral regions including fusiform cortex and cerebellum, displayed abnormally reduced activity in PD. These results indicate that PD induces a prefrontal hypoactivation that STN stimulation can partially restore in a modality selective manner by additional recruitment of limbic structures in SP WM or by recovery of the ventral prefrontal activation in NSP WM.

METHODS: The past and current goals of cerebral stimulation are reviewed as well as its limitations. A novel deep brain stimulation approach is proposed to evaluate this conceptual shift from somatosensory to affective sphere of pain targeting. APPROACH: Thalamic and other central pain syndromes are typically intractable to current treatment methods, including cerebral neuromodulation of somatosensory pathways, leading to long-term distress and disability. Our modern understanding of chronic pain pathophysiology is based largely on the neuromatrix theory, where cognitive, affective, and sensory-discriminative spheres contribute equally to the overall pain experience. During the last decade, the safety and feasibility of chronic stimulation of neural pathways related to mood and affect has been explored with promising results. Here, we propose a novel approach to modulate the affective sphere of chronic pain by targeting similar networks in patients with treatment-refractory central pain. Our primary goal is not to produce (or measure) analgesia, but rather to modulate the affective burden of chronic pain. DISCUSSION: Cerebral neuromodulation for neuropathic pain has had limited efficacy thus far. Shifting our aim to neural networks related to the affective sphere of pain may allow us to reduce pain conditioning and pain-related disability. Our ultimate goal is to promote rehabilitation from chronic pain-social and occupational.", "pages": "141-7"}, {"volume": "109", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata improves forelimb akinesia in the hemiparkinsonian rat.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "18560749", "authors": ["Sutton, AC", "Yu, W", "Calos, ME", "Smith, AB", "Ramirez-Zamora, A", "Molho, ES", "Pilitsis, JG", "Brotchie, JM", "Shin, DS"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Pain represents the most frequent symptom faced by general practitioners and is associated with 60% of neurological troubles. Pain consists in a conscious, subjective, unpleasant and protective sensory experience transmitted by thermoalgic pathways in the central nervous system (nociceptive pain).

Since the 1920's, neurosurgeons have attempted to alleviate nociceptive and neuropathic chronic pain by interrupting (irreversible interruptive techniques) thermoalgic fibers (neurotomies, rhizotomies, cordotomies, tractotomies, thalamotomies, cingulotomies). Some of them (neurotomies, rhizotomies) are still used today when all medications have failed. They can provide immediate and tremendous pain relief like in trigeminal neuralgia. However, the technique, when not sufficiently selective, can generate a neuropathic pain and then a short-lating pain relief. Increasing knowledge on pathophysiological mechanisms of pain allowed surgery to interfere with the functioning of the sensory circuits without lesioning and to modulate neuronal activity in order to reduce pain (neuromodulation).

However, detailed examination of a substantial number of exemplary preclinical and clinical studies reveals that any such interpretation is overoptimistic and suggests that DA deficiency may be merely an epiphenomenon of a larger process underlying this disorder. Such a conclusion is based on numerous examples of miscarriage of basic principles of good scientific practice including (i) failure to thoroughly examine the adverse effects of DA replacement, (ii) drawing of statistical inference without recognising excessive spread of measure thereby lessening the importance of outliers, (iii) confounding independent and dependent variables within the scientific paradigm, (iv) overlooking fundamental principles of modern pharmacology, (v) confusing correlation with causation in linking cause and effect and (vi) disinclination to incorporate conflicting findings thereby infringing the quintessential scientific principle of tertium quid.

It can be present even at diagnosis, but becomes more prevalent and worsens with disease progression. It represents one of the most disabling symptoms in the advanced stages of the disease, as it is associated with increased falls and loss of independence. Clinical and posturographic studies have contributed to significant advances in unravelling the complex pathophysiology of postural instability in patients with PD, but it still remains yet to be fully clarified, partly due to the difficulty in distinguishing between the disease process and the compensatory mechanisms, but also due to the fact that non-standardized techniques are used to measure balance and postural instability. There is increasing evidence that physical therapy, especially highly challenging balance exercises, can improve postural stability and reduce the risk of falls, although the long-term effects of physical therapy interventions on postural stability need to be explored given the progressive nature of PD. Pharmacotherapy with dopaminergic medications can provide significant improvements in postural instability in early- to mid-stage PD but the effects tend to wane with time consistent with spread of the disease process to non-dopaminergic pathways in advanced PD. Donepezil has been associated with a reduced risk of falls and methylphenidate has shown potential benefit against freezing of gait, but the results are yet to be replicated in large randomized studies. Surgical treatments, including lesioning and deep brain stimulation surgery targeting the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus, tend to only provide modest benefit for postural instability.

In addition, HFS of the SNr in brain slices from normal and reserpine-treated rat pups resulted in a depolarization block of SNr neuronal activity. We demonstrate improvement of forelimb akinesia with SNr-HFS and suggest that this motor effect may have resulted from the attenuation of SNr neuronal activity, decreased SNr beta oscillations, and increased activity of VM thalamic neurons, suggesting that the SNr may be a plausible DBS target for treating motor symptoms of DBS.", "pages": "141-7"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "The subthalamic nucleus at 3.0 Tesla: choice of optimal sequence and orientation for deep brain stimulation using a standard installation protocol: clinical article.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "23071824", "authors": ["Kerl, HU", "Gerigk, L", "Pechlivanis, I", "Al-Zghloul, M", "Groden, C", "N\u00f6lte, I"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "In stereotactic operations, intraoperative imaging is crucial in several stages of the procedure.

Previous studies have shown significant coherence between neuronal firing and LFPs at \u03b2 frequencies at sites separated by ~1 mm and that the magnitude of \u03b2 oscillatory LFP activity and coherence are greatly reduced following levodopa administration. However, these data have been collected from large DBS contact electrodes or pairs of microelectrodes in proximity to each other and so it is not clear whether all regions of STN are synchronized. It is also not known whether the LFP and neuronal activity in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) shows \u03b2 activity and whether it is coherent with STN activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the spatial extent of \u03b2 coherent activity in the STN and coherence between STN and SNr in PD patients OFF levodopa by systematically varying the distance between the dual microelectrodes. A total of 170 pairs of recordings were collected from 20 patients at rest undergoing DBS-STN implantation surgery. Trajectories passed dorsoventrally through STN and into SNr using two microelectrodes initially ~1mm apart. Once the microelectrodes entered the dorsal STN, one of the two was held stationary, while the other one was advanced into SNr over a distance of ~4-6mm. Pairs of recordings were obtained from STN/STN (n=111), STN/SNr (n=42), and SNr/SNr (n=17). We confirmed previous reports of a progressive attenuation in \u03b2 power as electrodes were driven from dorsal to ventral STN and into SNr.

To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study analyzing this technique. The evaluation is performed for 1.5 T MR scanners using a generic model of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) with a straight lead and a helical lead. The results show that the approach is technically feasible and provides sound and conservative information about the potential heating of implants. We demonstrate that (1) applying optimized tools results in reasonable uncertainties for the overall evaluation; (2) each tier reduces the overestimation by several dB at the cost of more demanding evaluation steps; (3) the implant with the straight lead would cause local temperature increases larger than 18 \u00b0C at the RF exposure limit for the normal operating mode; (4) Tier 3 is not sufficient for the helical implant; and (5) Tier 4 might be too demanding to be performed for complex implants. We conclude with a suggestion for a procedure that follows the same concept but is between Tier 3 and 4. In addition, the evaluation of Tier 3 has shown consistency with current scan practice, namely, the resulting heat at the lead tip is less than 3.5 \u00b0C for the straight lead and 0.7 \u00b0C for the helix lead for scans at the current applied MR scan restrictions for deep brain stimulation at a head average SAR of 0.1 W/kg.", "pages": "141-7"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Globus pallidus deep brain stimulation for refractory idiopathic restless legs syndrome.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "22037139", "authors": ["Ondo, WG", "Jankovic, J", "Simpson, R", "Jimenez-Shahed, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Sleep medicine", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Intracranial hemorrhage is a crucial complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The bleeding caused by mechanical tissue injury due to microelectrode and/or DBS electrode lead insertion has been well studied. However, hemorrhage caused by a congenital underlying disease such as vascular malformation has not been examined carefully. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We encountered a case of intracerebral hemorrhage from arteriovenous malformation (AVM) after DBS surgery. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging did not show any abnormality in the patient. Computed tomography (CT) images taken immediately after the surgery did not show any intracranial hematoma and other abnormal findings. However, the patient did not recover from the general anesthesia, and hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe was detected by CT performed a day after the surgery. The location of the hematoma was markedly distant from the trajectory of DBS leads. Evacuation of the hematoma under general anesthesia was immediately performed. RESULTS: As an intraoperative finding, we noted the presence of abnormal vessels inside the hematoma in the occipital lobe. Tissue specimens including the abnormal vessels were obtained for histopathological analysis, results of which led to the diagnosis was AVM. CONCLUSION: Despite its low incidence, we would like to advise that such a type of hemorrhage could occur and measures should be taken to prevent its occurrence as much as possible. Preoperative detection of abnormal vessels by MR angiography and/or CT angiography might be helpful.

Multiple studies identify a central role of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in addiction; several studies note decreased addictive behavior after interventions in this area. METHODS: Based on animal experiments, our institute started the clinical trial for the treatment of drug addicts' psychological dependence by making lesions in the bilateral NAc with stereotactic surgery from July 2000. RESULTS: The short-term outcomes were encouraging and triggered rapid application of this treatment in China from 2003 to 2004. However, lack of long-term outcomes and controversy eventually led to halting the surgery for addiction by the Ministry of Health of China in November 2004 and a nationwide survey about it later. Our institute had performed this surgery in 272 patients with severe heroin addiction. The follow-up study showed that the 5-year nonrelapse rate was 58% and the quality of life was significantly improved. Patients had several kinds of side effects, but the incidence rate was relatively low. The patients gradually recovered more than 5 years after the surgery. The side effects did not severely influence an individual's life or work. Nationwide surgery showed that the nonrelapse rate was 50% in the sample of 150 cases, from 1167 patients overall who underwent stereotactic surgery in China. CONCLUSIONS: Although sometimes accompanied by neuropsychological adverse events, stereotactic ablation of NAc may effectively treat opiate addiction. Lesion location has a significant impact on treatment efficacy and requires further study. Because ablation is irreversible, the NAc surgery for addiction should be performed with cautiousness, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an ideal alternative.", "pages": "141-7"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Impulsivities and Parkinson's disease: delay aversion is not worsened by Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "23062997", "authors": ["Torta, DM", "Vizzari, V", "Castelli, L", "Zibetti, M", "Lanotte, M", "Lopiano, L", "Geminiani, G"], "year": "2012", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "A 54-year-old white man presented with slowly progressive incoordination and weakness.

Continuous, off, and scheduled stimulation conditions were assessed blindly in an acute experiment at 6 months after implantation. The scores in all 3 conditions showed a trend for improvement. Trends for improvement also occurred with continuous and scheduled conditions performing better than the off condition. Tic suppression was commonly seen at ventral (deep) contacts, and programming settings resulting in tic suppression were commonly associated with a subjective feeling of calmness.", "pages": "141-7"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Parkinson's disease medication use and costs following deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "8065447", "authors": ["Weaver, FM", "Stroupe, KT", "Cao, L", "Holloway, RG", "Vickrey, BG", "Simuni, T", "Hendricks, A", "Ippolito, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "This study provides safety and proof of concept that a scheduled DBS approach could improve motor and vocal tics in Tourette syndrome.

The literature might, however, be somewhat unclear, considering the different targets used, and due to repeated inclusion of individual patients in multiple publications. The aim of this report was to review the literature on DBS for OCD. METHODS: The modern literature concerning studies conducted on DBS in the treatment of OCD was reviewed. RESULTS: The results of DBS in OCD have been presented in 25 reports with 130 patients, of which, however, only 90 contained individual patients. Five of these reports included at least 5 individual patients not presented elsewhere. Sixty-eight of these patients underwent implantation in the region of the internal capsule/ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. The target in this region has varied between groups and over time, but the latest results from bilateral procedures in this area have shown a 50% reduction of OCD scores, depression, and anxiety. The subthalamic nucleus has been suggested as an alternative target. Although beneficial effects have been demonstrated, the efficacy of this procedure cannot be decided, because only results after 3 months of active stimulation have been presented so far. CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a promising treatment for therapy-refractory OCD, but the published experience is limited and the method is at present an experimental therapy.", "pages": "141-7"}]
