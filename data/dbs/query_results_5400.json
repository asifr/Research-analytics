In particular, there is evidence that a strict topographic segregation is maintained during the processing of sensorimotor information flowing from cortical motor areas to the sensorimotor areas of the basal ganglia. The output from the basal ganglia to the motor thalamus, which projects back to neocortical motor areas, is also organized into topographically segregated channels. This high degree of topographic segregation is demonstrated by the presence of a well-defined somatotopic organization in the sensorimotor areas of the basal ganglia. The presence of body maps in the basal ganglia has become clinically relevant with the increasing use of surgical procedures, such as lesioning or deep brain stimulation, which are selectively aimed at restricted subcortical targets in the sensorimotor loop such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi). The ability to ameliorate the motor control dysfunction without producing side effects related to interference with non-motor circuits subserving associative or affective processing requires the ability to target subcortical areas particularly involved in sensorimotor processing (currently achieved only by careful intraoperative microelectrode mapping).

Input from the nucleus of the solitary tract is relayed to vagal efferent neurons that originate from two brain stem nuclei: the nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The latter is also influenced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone neurons that act centrally to stimulate acid secretion. The main peripheral stimulants of acid secretion are the hormone gastrin and the paracrine amine histamine. Gastrin stimulates acid secretion directly and, more importantly, indirectly by releasing histamine from fundic enterochromaffin-like cells. Gastrin also exerts trophic effects on various tissues, including the gastric and intestinal mucosa. The main inhibitor of acid secretion is somatostatin. Somatostatin, acting via ssTR2 receptors, exerts a tonic paracrine inhibitory influence on the secretion of gastrin, histamine, and acid secretion. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, adrenomedullin, amylin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide all stimulate somatostatin secretion and thus inhibit acid secretion. HK-ATPase, the proton pump of the parietal cell, is stored within cytoplasmic tubulovesicles during the resting state, but during stimulation, it is shuttled to the canalicular membrane by a poorly understood mechanism that probably involves soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins. The proton pump inhibitor, pantoprazole, is unique in that it binds cysteine 822, located deep within the membrane domain of the alpha-subunit. The difficulty that reducing agents, such as glutathione, have in reaching cysteine 822 may be responsible for the longer half-time for acid recovery observed with pantoprazole. Hypergastrinemia, induced by proton pump inhibitors, enhances expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and hence prostaglandins within parietal cells, a feedback pathway that may protect the stomach against acid-induced damage.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "142", "title": "Choosing electrodes for deep brain stimulation experiments--electrochemical considerations.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15698665", "authors": ["Gimsa, J", "Habel, B", "Schreiber, U", "van Rienen, U", "Strauss, U", "Gimsa, U"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "In the past year, significant advances have been made in understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion.

Kv1 channels were studied in cerebellar slices at physiological temperatures with Kv1-specific toxins. Outside-out voltage-clamp recordings indicated that Kv1 channels are present in both somatic and dendritic membranes and are activated by Na+ spike-clamp commands. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings revealed that Kv1 K+ channels maintain low frequencies of Na+ spike and Ca-Na burst output, regulate the duration of plateau potentials, and set the threshold for Ca2+ spike discharge. Kv1 channels shaped the characteristics of climbing fiber (CF) responses evoked by extracellular stimulation or intracellular simulated EPSCs. In the presence of Kv1 toxins, CFs discharged spontaneously at approximately 1 Hz. Finally, \"Kv1-intact\" and \"Kv1-deficient\" PC tonic and burst outputs were converted to stimulus protocols and used as patterns to stimulate PC axons and synaptically activate DCN neurons. We found that the Kv1-intact patterns facilitated short-latency and high-frequency DCN neuron rebound discharges, whereas DCN neuron output timing was markedly disrupted by the Kv1-deficient stimulus protocols.

Neurons in the intermediate/deep layers of the superior colliculus (dSC) are capable of integrating converging sensory inputs to influence the time to saccade initiation. To identify how neural processing in the dSC contributes to reducing SRTs to audiovisual stimuli, we recorded activity from dSC neurons while monkeys generated saccades to visual or audiovisual stimuli. To evoke crossmodal interactions of varying strength, we used auditory and visual stimuli of different intensities, presented either in spatial alignment or to opposite hemifields. Spatially aligned audiovisual stimuli evoked the shortest SRTs. In the case of low-intensity stimuli, the response to the auditory component of the aligned audiovisual target increased the activity preceding the response to the visual component, accelerating the onset of the visual response and facilitating the generation of shorter-latency saccades. In the case of high-intensity stimuli, the auditory and visual responses occurred much closer together in time and so there was little opportunity for the auditory stimulus to influence previsual activity. Instead, the reduction in SRT for high-intensity, aligned audiovisual stimuli was correlated with increased premotor activity (activity after visual burst but preceding saccade-aligned burst). These data provide a link between changes in neural activity related to stimulus modality with changes in behavior. They further demonstrate how crossmodal interactions are not limited to the initial sensory activity but can also influence premotor activity in the SC.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "352", "title": "Bilateral deep-brain stimulation of the globus pallidus in primary generalized dystonia.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "15689584", "authors": ["Vidailhet, M", "Vercueil, L", "Houeto, JL", "Krystkowiak, P", "Benabid, AL", "Cornu, P", "Lagrange, C", "T\u00e9zenas du Montcel, S", "Dormont, D", "Grand, S", "Blond, S", "Detante, O", "Pillon, B", "Ardouin, C", "Agid, Y", "Dest\u00e9e, A", "Pollak, P", ""], "year": "2005", "journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy of movement disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD).

Electrode properties could largely be restored by proteolytic treatment for platinum/iridium electrodes but not for stainless steel ones. Short-term drift and irreversible aging could be followed by impedance measurements. Aging was accompanied by metal corrosion and erosion of the plastic insulation. For both materials, the degradation rates depended on the current density at the electrode surfaces. Fourier analysis of the DBS pulse (60 micros, repetition rate 130 Hz) revealed harmonic frequencies spanning a band of more than three decades, with significant harmonics up to the MHz range. The band is located in a window imposed by electrode processes and capacitive cell membrane bridging at the low and high frequency ends, respectively. Even though electrode processes are reduced at higher frequencies they only vanish above 1 MHz and cannot be avoided. Therefore, the use of inert electrode materials is of special importance. The neurotoxicity of iron makes avoiding stainless steel electrodes imperative.

However, the precision of electrode placement is crucial for obtaining successful results. Currently, surgeons rely on preoperative MRI or CT images to derive stereotactic coordinates for targeting sites such as the subthalamic nucleus and ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus coupled with microelectrode recordings during surgery for proper electrode placement. However, it has been argued that the stereotactic head frame produces detrimental artifacts during MRI. We examined MRI images taken from 11 patients undergoing repeat DBS surgery, and determined the coordinates of the previously placed electrode. We then set the Leksell G stereotactic frame to these coordinates and obtained fluoroscope-localizing images. Using MATLAB image analysis tools, we were able to quantify the 3-dimensional error in target localization by measuring the distance from the electrode tip to the targeted coordinate. The mean errors were 0.09 +/- 0.34 mm perpendicular, lateral to medial, 0.01 +/- 0.32 perpendicular, posterior to anterior, and -0.08 +/- 0.33 mm parallel to the electrode, superior to inferior.

Correlation and coherence analysis between data obtained in the bulb and cortex reveals a clear difference in coupling depending on the anesthetic state of the animal. Specifically, activity recorded in the whole system is highly correlated with respiration during deep anesthesia, whereas only the olfactory bulb, and not the cortex, is correlated with respiration during light anesthesia.

All were multicentre and conducted in the US. All patients included had previously received BtA. The trials differed with respect to whether or not the patients were still responding to BtA but other entry criteria were similar. Patient groups were appropriately selected and well matched. From the methodological point of view these trials were probably not subjected to important selection, performance or attrition bias and all studies used an intention-to-treat analysis.The dose varied significantly between studies although all used 10,000 Units of BtB in one group and the technique of administration was the same. The primary outcome in all trials was change in TWSTRS total score at week four and other efficacy outcomes were similar between studies. The number of dropouts was small and balanced in all trials. Reasons for withdrawals were given. One randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was excluded because data couldn't be extracted for the outcomes. Meta-analysis showed statistically and clinically significant improvements with a Peto odds ratio (OR) of 20% in TWSTRS total score at week four (OR 4.69; 95% CI 2.06 to 10.69) and a weighted mean difference of -5.92 (95% CI -9.61 to -2.23). Subjective rating scales (Patient Global Assessment of Change, Investigator Global Assessment of Change, and Patient Analog Pain Assessment) also improved. The weighted mean difference for changes in these subjective scales varied between -13% to -21%. However, for many of the outcomes, we could not combine data from all studies. Only adverse events clearly associated with the mechanism of action of BtB were more frequent in the treatment group. These included dysphagia and dry mouth. The number of patients with any adverse event was more frequent with BtB. Subgroup analyses showed a clear dose-response relationship for subjective and objective benefit and for frequency and severity of adverse events. Subgroup analyses showed a greater benefit for the BtA resistant patients than BtA responders in the primary outcome. The duration of effect was about 16 weeks.

Diagnostic T (2)W MRI suggested that the patient's STN was in a typical location and seemed to confirm the statistical atlas-based planning. Intraoperatively, cell activity recording (MER) with five parallel electrodes could not reveal any STN typical activity profile and electrical stimulation was not able to disclose a medial or lateral displacement of the electrodes. The operation was discontinued and postoperative stereotactic CT confirmed that the correct target area had been approached during the operation. Postoperative T (2)W MRI now disclosed a left STN which was 2 mm medial of the initial target and lead to a further medial target definition and finally to a successful DBS placement. In conclusion, finding a deep seated DBS target like the STN can be difficult in cases with an extremely deviant anatomy even if reiterative sophisticated multimodal planning is used.

Various changes in TMS parameters, revealing motor cortex dysfunction, were found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). For instance, low MT and increased MEP size disclosed an enhanced corticospinal motor output at rest, while reduced ICF and failure of MEP size increase during contraction suggested defective facilitatory cortical inputs, particularly for movement execution. Inhibitory cortical pathways were also found less excitable at rest (reduced ICI) and sometimes during contraction (shortened CSP). By restoring cortical inhibition, dopaminergic drugs and deep brain stimulation probably overcome the difficulty to focus neuronal activity onto the appropriate network required for a specific motor task.

It is possible that this nociceptive reflex activity is influenced by muscle length since recent evidence indicates that abnormal neck posture may be associated with cervical musculoskeletal disorders and pain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test if muscle length modulates this nociceptive reflex response. Three different experimental procedures were employed in rats under halothane anesthesia: (1) MO injected into the left deep neck muscles with the rat placed in a straight body position (Straight group, n = 7); (2) MO injected into lengthened left deep neck muscles with the rat's neck rotated 45 degrees to the right with respect to the head (Stretched group, n = 11); and (3) MO injected into the right deep neck muscles with the rat's neck rotated 45 degrees to the right (Relaxed group, n = 9). The EMG activity of the deep neck, trapezius, and digastric muscles was bilaterally recorded, rectified and integrated into area under the curve (AUC). Control injections of the vehicle, mineral oil, did not evoke any muscle activity but MO evoked EMG activity in the ipsilateral deep neck and trapezius muscles of the Stretched group that was significantly greater than that evoked in the same muscles in the Straight and Relaxed groups. Also, the MO-evoked EMG activity in the contralateral deep neck muscles of the Stretched and Relaxed groups was greater than that of the corresponding muscles in the Straight group. The MO-evoked activity in the digastric, a jaw muscle whose length was not changed, did not show any significant difference between the three groups. These findings indicate that MO application to the rat deep neck muscles results in a larger nociceptive reflex in deep neck and trapezius muscles when they are stretched.

The role of Torsin A in the pathogenesis of DYT1 is unknown. For a certain neuron or neuronal system to manifest a clinical symptom, it should reach to a certain maturational level.

Central sensitization involves an increase in the excitability of medullary dorsal horn (subnucleus caudalis) and spinal dorsal horn neurons brought about by a series of events including neuronal depolarization; removal of the voltage-dependent magnesium block of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor; release of calcium from intracellular stores; phosphorylation of the NMDA, alpha amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA), and neurokinin (NK) 1 receptors via activation of protein kineses; a change in the neuron's excitability; and an increase in synaptic strength. Central sensitization occurs in trigeminal nociceptive pathways, and more robust neuronal hyperexcitability occurs following deep tissue stimulation than cutaneous stimulation. Utilizing Fos protein immunocytochemistry, it has been found that 2 distinct regions are activated in the trigeminal brainstem sensory nuclei, the subnuclei interpolaris/caudalis transition zone (Vi/Vc) and the caudal part of the subnucleus caudalis. The latter is very similar to the spinal dorsal horn and is involved in the sensory discriminative aspects of pain. In contrast, the ventral pole of the Vi/Vc is unique. In addition to its role in the nociceptive sensory processing of deep tissues, it is involved bilaterally in somatovisceral and somatoautonomic processing, activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis, and descending modulatory control.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and of the pars interna of Globus Pallidus (GPi) is used to improve parkinsonian symptoms and attenuate levodopa-induced motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) (DBS for PD study group, 2001). It is still not clear what the best anatomic structures to stimulate are or what the physiologic effects of DBS are. Most of the studies regarding DBS for parkinsonian symptoms have been conducted in patients with STN implantation, and these studies reported significant improvement in motor function with a relatively low rate of complication. The large experience of ablative surgery associated with the DBS experience of some groups worldwide indicate that GPi is a possible and very promising target for the management of parkinsonian symptoms. Surgical procedures have become safer and it is now possible, in selected cases, to target both structures in the same patient by means of the stereotactic system, \"3P Maranello\" (CLS-SRL, Italy). Using this system we were able to evaluate the clinical effects of simultaneous stimulation of both STN and GPi as well as evaluate the effects of isolated stimulation of each target. As it is known that there is a high intersubject variability of DBS, it seems relevant to test all different combinations of DBS in the same patient. Methods. We assessed the effects of DBS in 13 cases of PD, immediately after (30\u00a0min) stimulation and during chronic stimulation (weeks or months). Patients fell into two groups. The first (n\u00a0=\u00a07) responded to both GPi and STN stimulation equally. The second group (n\u00a0=\u00a06) was preferentially stimulated with only one target (STN\u00a0=\u00a05, GPi\u00a0=\u00a01). Results. There was a good reduction in levodopa treatment following surgery. Most patients remained were chronically treated with bilateral stimulation of both targets. Conclusion. We conclude that DBS of STN and GPi was effective, with most patients treated chronically with both targets stimulated.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "[Clinical utility of deep brain stimulation in an advanced Parkinson's disease].", "issue": "10", "pmid": "23074471", "authors": ["Escamilla-Sevilla, F", "M\u00ednguez-Castellanos, A", "Katati, MJ", "Mart\u00edn-Linares, JM", "Meersmans, M", "Ortega-Moreno, A", "Arjona, V"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Neurolog\u00eda (Barcelona, Spain)", "abstract": "The authors systematically studied the emergence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) after subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD).

This inhibition is made mainly through GABAergic neurons from substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNpr), that sends outputs toward neural networks of the deep layers of the superior colliculus and dorsal periaqueductal gray matter involved with the organization of fear-like responses. In this work, we compared the effects of two GABAergic agonists, muscimol and baclofen, with the effect of neurotoxin AvTx8 (1567 Da), isolated from the venom of the social wasp Agelaia vicina, microinjected into SNpr of Rattus norvegicus (Wistar rats) prior to dlSC saline or bicuculline microinjections, considering that wasp venom has some influence on the uptake of GABA and/or glutamate neurotransmitters. GABA(A) receptor blockade in the dlSC evoked a vigorous escape behavior, expressed by rapid running, jumps and turns, as compared to control. These defensive reactions were maximized after the intranigral GABA(A) agonism with muscimol, but not after in situ GABA(B) agonism. Nigral microinjection of AvTx8 induced similar effects to those of baclofen, decreasing the intensity of behavioral defensive reactions caused by GABA(A) receptor blockade in the dorsal mesencephalon. These findings suggest that AvTx8 has some effects on GABAergic neurotransmission, increasing the activity of the inhibitory nigro-collicular pathways, causing an anti-panic (antiaversive) effect. Therefore, our work suggests AvTx8 as a novel pharmacological tool to study differences between the two types of GABAergic receptors and excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the brain and brainstem networks.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "130", "title": "Afferent subcortical connections into the motor cortical larynx area in the rhesus monkey.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15689584", "authors": ["Simonyan, K", "J\u00fcrgens, U"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "To evaluate the prevalence of adverse events and complications during surgery using deep brain electrodes, mainly in the treatment of Parkinsonism.

However, little is known regarding the relationship of oscillations to volitional movements. Our goal was to evaluate the dynamics of oscillatory activity at rest and during movement. We performed microelectrode recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. During recordings, the patients used a joystick to guide a cursor to one of four targets on a monitor. We recorded 184 cells and 47 pairs of cells in 11 patients. At rest, 26 cells (14%) demonstrated significant oscillatory activity, with a mean frequency of 18 Hz. During movement, this oscillatory activity was either reduced or completely abolished in all of the cells. At rest, 18 pairs (38%) of cells in five patients exhibited synchronized oscillatory activity, with a mean frequency of 15 Hz. In 17 of the 18 pairs, both of the cells exhibited oscillations, and, in one pair, only one of the cells was oscillatory. These synchronized oscillations were also significantly decreased with movement. There was a strong inverse correlation between firing rates and oscillatory activity. As the firing rates increased with movement, there was a decrease in oscillatory activity. These findings suggest that visually guided movements are associated with a dampening and desynchronization of oscillatory activity in STN neurons. One possible explanation for these observations is that the increased cortical drive associated with movement preparation and execution leads to a transient dampening of STN oscillations, hence facilitating movement.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Cost analysis of unilateral and bilateral pallidotomy for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "14614167", "authors": ["Green, AL", "Joint, C", "Sethi, H", "Bain, P", "Aziz, TZ"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) is part of a network of brain areas that directs saccadic eye movements, overtly shifting both gaze and attention from position to position, in space.

While requiring monkeys to keep their gaze fixed, we tested whether microstimulation of a specific location in the SC spatial map would enhance visual performance at the corresponding region of space, a diagnostic measure of covert attention. We find that microstimulation improves performance in a spatially selective manner: thresholds decrease at the location in visual space represented by the stimulated SC site, but not at a control location in the opposite hemifield.

These recordings not only assist in determining the optimal target for electrode implantation, but also offer the unique opportunity to study movement-evoked responses from the basal ganglia. We report on the responses of human STN neurons to eye movements from eight PD patients (five men and three women). Twenty percent (18/89) of tested STN neurons showed responses to eye movements. Patients made pro-saccades, voluntary saccades or smooth pursuit eye movements in four directions: up, down, left, right. The majority of STN neurons (72% or 13/18), that responded to eye movements were found in the ventral half of the nucleus, while 58% (22/38) of STN neurons that had somatic responses were found in the dorsal half of the nucleus. The firing rate for STN oculomotor neurons was 33+/-15 Hz (n = 18), which was not different from that reported previously for STN neurons. Most neurons only responded to eye movements in a single direction, but 17% (3/18) showed responses to more than one direction. The majority of responses (17/18) to eye movements were increases in firing rate although one neuron did show a pause in firing with eye movement onset. The phasic changes in firing rate in response to eye movement usually occurred up to 250 ms following eye movement onset. Neurons were found that showed task-specific responses to cued versus self-paced saccades, responded to both passive limb movement and voluntary eye movement, and appeared to show either visual or attentional responses. These human physiological data, in conjunction with previous anatomical studies, suggest that the STN might have an oculomotor role. Although there is no evidence that STN is responsible for driving eye movements, it may have a role in either sensory feedback, corollary discharge, or in focusing the substantia nigra pars reticulata to allow a saccade to occur through disinhibition of the superior colliculus.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Spatial correlations of laminar BOLD and CBV responses to rat whisker stimulation with neuronal activity localized by Fos expression.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "15050447", "authors": ["Lu, H", "Patel, S", "Luo, F", "Li, SJ", "Hillard, CJ", "Ward, BD", "Hyde, JS"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine : official journal of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine / Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become an important modality in the treatment of refractory Parkinson disease (PD). In patients with comorbid arrhythmias requiring cardiac pacemakers, DBS therapy is complicated by concerns over a possible electrical interaction between the devices (or with device programming) and the inability to use magnetic resonance imaging guidance for implantation. The authors report two cases of PD in which patients with preexisting cardiac pacemakers underwent successful implantation of bilateral DBS electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Each patient underwent computerized tomography-guided stereotactic frame-based placement of DBS electrodes with microelectrode recording. Both extension wires were passed from the right side of the head and neck (contralateral to the pacemaker) to place the cranial pulse generators subcutaneously in the left and right abdomen. The cranial pulse generators were placed farther than 6 in from the cardiac pacemaker and from each other to decrease the chance of interference between the devices during telemetry reprogramming. Postoperative management involved brain stimulator programming sessions with simultaneous cardiological monitoring of pacemaker function and cardiac rhythm. No interference was noted at any time, and proper pacemaker function was maintained throughout the follow-up period. With bilateral STN stimulation, both patients experienced a dramatic improvement in their PD symptoms, including elimination of dyskinesias, reduction of \"off\" severity, and increase of \"on\" duration. With some modifications of implantation strategy, two patients with cardiac pacemakers were successfully treated with bilateral DBS STN therapy for refractory PD.

Aldini was born in Bologna in 1762 and graduated in physics at the University of his native town in 1782. As nephew and assistant of Galvani, he actively participated in a series of crucial experiments with frog's muscles that led to the idea that electricity was the long-sought vital force coursing from brain to muscles. Aldini became professor of experimental physics at the University of Bologna in 1798. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, spending much time defending the concept of his discreet uncle against the incessant attacks of Volta, who did not believe in animal electricity. Aldini used Volta's bimetallic pile to apply electric current to dismembered bodies of animals and humans; these spectacular galvanic reanimation experiments made a strong and enduring impression on his contemporaries. Aldini also treated patients with personality disorders and reported complete rehabilitation following transcranial administration of electric current. Aldini's work laid the ground for the development of various forms of electrotherapy that were heavily used later in the 19th century. Even today, deep brain stimulation, a procedure currently employed to relieve patients with motor or behavioral disorders, owes much to Aldini and galvanism. In recognition of his merits, Aldini was made a knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of state at Milan, where he died in 1834.", "pages": "15-7"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "[Psychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease following deep brain stimulation surgery on the subthalamic nucleus].", "issue": "7", "pmid": "7719342", "authors": ["Salvador-Aguiar, C", "Men\u00e9ndez-Guisasola, L", "Bl\u00e1zquez-Estrada, M", "Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez, F", "Seijo-Fern\u00e1ndez, F"], "year": "", "journal": "Revista de neurologia", "abstract": "We report on the case of a woman with generalized dystonia and restless legs syndrome whose restless legs resolved after bilateral internal globus pallidus deep brain stimulation, and recurred unilaterally after an infection required removal of one of the devices.", "pages": "15-7"}]
