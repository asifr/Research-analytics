The goal of the present study was to determine the postnatal developmental profile of EGR-1 protein (also termed zif268, Krox-24, NGFI-A) expression across the layers of cal visual cortex and relate it to the state of visual cortical development and plasticity. Using a polyclonal antibody, EGR-1 immunoreactivity was studied in animals of various postnatal ages (from 0.5 week to adult). In very young animals (0.5 weeks), EGR-1 positive cells were restricted to deep cortical layers (layer VI/Subplate). With the increasing age, EGR-1 immunoreactivity spread across layers of the visual cortex in an inside-outside manner, and by 5 weeks of age, EGR-1 protein was highly expressed in all layers. EGR-1 expression remained high until approximately 10 weeks of age and then gradually began to decline in layer IV with little change in supra- and infragranular layers. In adult animals, EGR-1 was located predominantly in the layers above and below layer IV. This pattern of EGR-1 expression in developing cat visual cortex has both temporal and laminar similarities with the development of visual cortical connectivity, with the development of orientation selective receptive field properties, and with the level of visual cortical plasticity, suggesting an involvement of EGR-1 expression in these processes.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "703", "title": "Electrophysiology and GABA-immunocytochemistry in the vestibular nuclei of normal (C57BL/6J) and Leaner mutant mice.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "8719615", "authors": ["Gr\u00fcsser-Cornehls, U", "Luy, M", "B\u00e4urle, J"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Neurological disorders of genetic origin that lead to distinct disarrangements of the cerebellar wiring and cause a specific motor behaviour are likely to differentially influence the response properties and activity of postsynaptic cerebellar target neurons in the deep cerebellar (DCN) and vestibular nuclei (VN). Comparative electrophysiological and morphological analyses of these neurons in different mutants may increase our understanding of the physiological consequences of cell damage to the cerebellum and help to elucidate the relationships between histopathology and severeness of motor impairment. The Leaner mutation removes GABAergic inhibitory input to the VN predominantly originating from Purkinje cells (PC) located in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and causes extremely severe motor disability when compared to other cerebellar mutants. In the present study the electrophysiological properties of naturally stimulated (sinusoidal head and body rotation) neurons in the VN of Leaner mutants and their corresponding wild-types (C57BL/6J) were investigated. Neuronal activity of VN single units in Leaner mutants is significantly increased over that of wild-types (frequency range 0.2-0.6 Hz) and more pronounced for type I neurons than for type II. Phase relationships and spontaneous activity are similar at these frequencies in both groups. To elucidate the degree of GABAergic input loss of VN-neurons, quantitative morphometric and numerical analyses of GABA-immunopositive synaptic boutons in the lateral VN of Leaner mutants were performed in addition and revealed significantly smaller terminals and a massive decrease (80%) in Leaner mutant terminal numbers compared to controls. In the context of the findings recently obtained in Weaver and Purkinje cell degeneration (PCD) mutants, the results in Leaner suggest that the loss of inhibition due to the PC degeneration in the anterior vermis leads to a differential enhancement of type I and type II target neuron activity in the VN. The overall activity in Leaner is intermediate between PCD (no increase in activity) and Weaver (strong increase of type I but no increase of type II). GABA-immunocytochemistry supports the idea that in Leaner the lost GABAergic PC-innervation of the lateral VN has not been replaced by surviving PCs, which is in contrast to Weaver where sprouting of GABAergic terminals in this nucleus was observed. Substitution of lost cerebellar inhibition by non-cerebellar sources, as suggested in the case of PCD-mutants, is uncertain in Leaner due to the increased activity of type I target neurons. These conditions may contribute, among others, to the severe motor disturbances in Leaner.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "701", "title": "Metabolic and functional mapping of the neural network subserving inferior collicular seizure generalization.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "8925273", "authors": ["McCown, TJ", "Duncan, GE", "Johnson, KB", "Breese, GR"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The sensory-motor portion of the inferior collicular cortex is capable of seizure genesis that is characterized initially by coincident wild running behaviors and localized electrographic afterdischarge. With repeated stimulations, this seizure activity spreads into the forebrain, producing generalized tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizure activity. In order to characterize the neural network subserving this caudal-rostral seizure generalization, three mapping techniques were used: 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) utilization, c-fos expression and local anesthetic microinjection. Kindled seizure generalization from the inferior collicular cortex produced a global increase in 2-DG accumulation, while relative 2-DG increases were found in the inferior collicular cortex, dorsal lateral lemniscus, dorsal central gray, peripeduncular nucleus, medial geniculate nucleus, substantia nigra, entopeduncular nucleus, ventroposterior and centromedian thalamus and tenia tectum, as well as the perirhinal, somatosensory and frontal cortices. Kindled seizure generalization also increased c-fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the inferior collicular cortex, cuneiform nucleus, dorsal lateral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, peripeduncular nucleus, caudal central gray, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, rhinal fissure area of the perirhinal cortex and the frontal cortex. Microinjections of procaine into the amygdala, perirhinal cortex, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, peripeduncular nucleus, dorsal central gray, and pontine reticular nucleus all prevented generalized seizure behaviors, but had no effect on the wild running seizures. Conversely, procaine microinjection into the area of the cuneiform nucleus/pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus prevented the wild running seizure but did not block the generalized seizure activity. Neither wild running, nor generalized seizures were altered following procaine microinjections into the anterior thalamus, sub-thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampus or deep superior colliculus. Thus, specific forebrain sites form a widespread neural network that mediates the generalization of seizure activity from the inferior collicular cortex into the forebrain.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Magnetic field tomography of cortical and deep processes: examples of \"real-time mapping\" of averaged and single trial MEG signals.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8788219", "authors": ["Ioannides, AA", "Liu, MJ", "Liu, LC", "Bamidis, PD", "Hellstrand, E", "Stephan, KM"], "year": "1995", "journal": "International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology", "abstract": "Magnetic field tomography (MFT) provides 3-dimensional estimates of brain activity, from non-contact, non-invasive measurements of the magnetic field generated by coherent electrical activity in the brain.

Moreover, the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) and the endogenous opioid ligand, Met5-enkephalin (ENK) are known to be prominently distributed in insular limbic cortex. To examine the anatomical sites for opioid activation of DOR in rat insular cortex, we used immunoperoxidase for detection of an antiserum raised against a peptide sequence unique to the DOR alone, and in combination with immunogold-silver labeling for ENK. Light microscopy showed intense DOR-like immunoreactivity (DOR-LI) in pyramidal cells and interneurons in deep laminae, and in varicose processes in both superficial and deep layers of the insular cortex. Ultrastructural analysis of layers V and VI in insular cortex showed that the most prominent immunoperoxidase labeling for DOR was in dendrites. This labeling was associated with asymmetric excitatory-type junctions postsynaptic to unlabeled terminals. Dendritic DOR-LI was also distributed along selective portions of non-synaptic plasma membranes and subsurface organelles. In dually labeled sections, dendrites containing DOR-LI sometimes received synaptic input from ENK-labeled terminals or more infrequently colocalized with ENK. Other axon terminals were exclusively immunolabeled for DOR or more rarely contained both DOR and ENK immunoreactivity. Within labeled axon terminals, distinct segments of the plasma membrane and membranes of immediately adjacent synaptic vesicles showed the largest accumulation of the peroxidase reaction product for DOR. These results indicate that in rat insular cortex DOR is primarily heteroreceptive, but also serves an autoreceptive function on certain ENK-containing neurons. Our results also provide the first ultrastructural evidence that in rat insular cortex endogenous opioids interact through the DOR (1) to modulate the postsynaptic responses to other excitatory afferents and (2) to presynaptically regulate the release of other neurotransmitters. The modulatory actions on both ENK-containing and non-ENK-containing neurons may contribute significantly to the reinforcing properties of exogenous opiates acting on the DOR in limbic cortex.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "489 ( Pt 1)", "title": "Anterior pretectal nucleus facilitation of superficial dorsal horn neurones and modulation of deafferentation pain in the rat.", "issue": "", "pmid": "8583399", "authors": ["Rees, H", "Terenzi, MG", "Roberts, MH"], "year": "1995", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1. Functional relationships between the anterior pretectal nucleus (APTN) and nociceptive dorsal horn neurones were investigated electrophysiologically in the anaesthetized rat. The effects of APTN lesions were assessed behaviourally in a model of deafferentation pain. 2. Cells in the dorsal and rostral parts of the APTN were excited orthodromically by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus or the contralateral dorsal columns, and by noxious and innocuous cutaneous stimuli. 3. Electrical stimulation of the APTN excited nociceptive lamina I spinal neurones. These cells all projected rostrally in the contralateral dorsolateral funiculus. Identical APTN stimulation also inhibited multireceptive spinal neurones which lay deep in the dorsal horn. These particular cells were shown to project to the brain in the ventrolateral funiculus. 4. It is proposed that noxious stimuli excite spinal lamina I projection neurones which send excitatory axons to the brain, including the APTN. The APTN inhibits deep multireceptive neurones, to reduce the perception of noxious stimuli. The discharge of spinal lamina I neurones, however, will be sustained by the noxious stimulus and by facilitation from the APTN. A sustained descending inhibition of this nature would reduce responses to prolonged injury. 5. The involvement of the APTN in responses to a chronic pain state was examined by comparing the behaviour of animals with bilateral lesions of the APTN with normal controls. Lesions of the APTN strongly enhanced the autotomy behaviour triggered by sectioning of the dorsal roots. 6.

Although the effects of lesions resulting from electrode implantation are generally considered minimal, some reports have shown lasting neurochemical, histological, and behavioral alterations in response to such implantation. Furthermore, there is some evidence that prolonged electrode implantation may decrease the seizure threshold of the implanted region and increases the rate of kindling from this region. This prompted us to undertake a study on different periods of post-surgical delay to onset of electrical stimulation and subsequent characteristics of kindling development. Rats were implanted with a bipolar electrode in the basolateral amygdala, and the threshold for induction of focal paroxysmal activity (afterdischarge threshold, ADT) was determined after post-surgical recovery periods of either 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks. The animals were then kindled by daily administration of an electrical stimulus until all rats exhibited fully kindled seizures. In fully kindled rats, the ADT was redetermined. Compared to animals with 1 week of electrode implantation, the pre-kindling ADT was significantly lower in rats with 2 and 4 weeks of electrode implantation, but returned towards the 1 week values at 8 weeks. An enhanced kindling rate was seen when kindling stimulations were started after 4 and 8 weeks of electrode implantation. Despite the marked differences in pre-kindling ADT, the post-kindling ADT was similar in the groups with 1, 2, or 4 weeks but significantly lower in the group with 8 weeks post-surgical delay to onset of testing. The data suggest that prolonged implantation of a bipolar electrode into a sensitive region of the limbic system predisposes the brain to kindling. Based on previous observation of iron deposits induced by electrode implantation and the epileptogenic effect of iron in cortical and limbic regions, we propose that the present observations are due to deposition of iron from hemoglobin destruction in local microhemorrhages caused by the implantation.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Somatotopy of monkey premotor cortex examined with microstimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "3722448", "authors": ["Godschalk, M", "Mitz, AR", "van Duin, B", "van der Burg, H"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Neuroscience research", "abstract": "We reinvestigated the organization of the premotor cortex (PM) using intracortical microstimulation.

The 24-h experiment shows that there is no phase-shifting on the diurnal NAS curve of groups of rats with bilateral IGL lesion compared to the controls. On the other hand there is a significant reduction on the amplitude of pineal NAS content observed in every nocturnal point of the curve. The pineal glands of IGL-lesioned rats, after 1 min of retinal light stimulation, keep their NAS content equal to the lesioned dark-killed rats. Nonetheless, after 15 min of photostimulation, the pineal NAS content is reduced to nearly zero equally to the control animals. DP lesion does not modify the content of NAS in the pineal gland of rats killed in the dark. However, the pineal photo-inhibition process induced by 1 min of light exposure is impaired. These results suggest that: (1) the intergeniculate leaflet has a role in regulating the amplitude of the diurnal rhythm of pineal NAS production rather than its phase entrainment to light-dark cycle. This effect is not dependent on the direct geniculo-pineal connections. (2) The nocturnal pineal photo-inhibition phenomenon could be decomposed in two processes.

These properties are similar to those of the frontal eye fields (FEF) in the prefrontal cortex of primates. The forebrain was surveyed for sites where electrical microstimulation would induce head saccades. Head (and eye) saccades were elicited from the anterior 70% of the archistriatum, a region that we refer to as the archistriatal gaze fields (AGF). At single stimulation sites in the AGF, saccade amplitude tended to vary as a function of stimulation parameters (current strength, pulse frequency, and train duration) and starting head position. In contrast, saccade direction was largely independent of these parameters. Saccade direction did vary over a wide range of primarily contraversive directions with the site of stimulation in the AGF. Using anatomical pathway tracing techniques, we found that the archistriatum projects strongly and in parallel to the deep layers of the OT and to nuclei in the midline brainstem tegmentum.

In one brain stem region, anterior to the optic tectum and deep to the dorsal surface, all of the visually responsive neurons were direction sensitive (DS) to contralateral retinal stimulation. The location and properties of these cells indicate that they are in the mesencephalic lentiform nucleus (nLM). Anterograde transport of intravitreally injected horseradish peroxidase revealed that this pretectal nucleus receives direct input from the contralateral eye. 3. All but 2 of the 48 cells of the nLM were strongly DS. The most effective stimulus was a slowly moving complex visual pattern that drifted nasally in the contralateral visual field. Brief flashes of spots, patterns, or diffuse light were much less effective. Receptive fields were large and usually (9 of 13 cells) centered in the superior visual field near the horizon and nasal to the blind spot. 4. The visual responses of nLM cells were compared to those of cells in the superficial layers of the optic tectum. In contrast to nLM, the responses of tectal cells were heterogeneous and frequently not DS. Neither tectum or nLM cells had much spontaneous spike activity during darkness or stationary patterns. On the other hand, visual responses of nLM cells were very similar to those of the BON, where neurons also had low spontaneous activity, preferred slow-moving patterns, and were DS. However, nLM and BON exhibit different distributions of preferred directions. Most nLM cells preferred temporal-to-nasal motion, whereas BON cells preferred almost any direction, although few preferred the nasal direction. nLM cell responses were not affected by removal of the ventral brain stem including the BON. 5. The visual properties of nLM cells recorded in vitro were very similar to those that were recorded in intact turtles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "678", "title": "Fos induction in the medullary dorsal horn and C1 segment of the spinal cord by acute inflammation in aged rats.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "6504550", "authors": ["Iwata, K", "Kanda, K", "Tsuboi, Y", "Kitajima, K", "Sumino, R"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "In order to elucidate the effect of aging on nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, c-fos was used as a marker of excitability of neurons in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) and the first spinal segment (C1) following noxious stimulation of the lateral face of young and aged rats.

By contrast, in superficial (layer II-III) neurons, the same stimulus evoked an EPSP that was followed by a prolonged response whose late component reversed at subthreshold membrane potentials (between -50 and -80 mV).

Electrical stimulation of the nucleus was found to reduce the nociceptive responses of deep dorsal horn neurons and to inhibit spinally integrated withdrawal reflexes. It is believed that at least part of the descending inhibitory effects of the anterior pretectal nucleus are mediated by reticulospinal cells of the ventrolateral medulla. The purpose of the present study was to trace the direct medullary projections of the anterior pretectal nucleus, to describe their topographical organization and to reveal the chemical nature of some of their putative target cells. The connections were studied using anterograde tract-tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. Direct projections from the anterior pretectal nucleus to the ipsilateral rostral ventral medulla were found in all cases. A dense innervation of the dorsal inferior olive, the gigantocellular reticular nucleus pars ventralis and pars alpha and the ventral pontine reticular nucleus was found from all aspects of the anterior pretectal nucleus. Descending labelled terminals were also observed in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus proper and, laterally, in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus and in the region of the A5 noradrenergic cell group. A relatively lower density of labelled terminals was noted in the medullary raphe nuclei and in the rostroventrolateral reticular nucleus. Following tract-tracer injections into five distinct subregions of the anterior pretectal nucleus, the topographical organization of the projection was examined and the relatively highest density and most widespread projection was found to originate from the caudoventral part of the anterior pretectal nucleus. A combined tract-tracing and immunolabelling study revealed that some of the descending, labelled terminals were in close proximity of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dendrites in the C1 and A5 cell groups. Some labelled fibres were also noted among the serotonin-immunoreactive cells in the lateral extension of the B3 cell population. The existence of direct projections to the ventral medulla and pons correlates well with physiological data which showed that the descending, antinociceptive effects of the anterior pretectal nucleus are relayed via the rostral ventrolateral medulla. The data are also in keeping with pharmacological studies that suggested the role of catecholaminergic cells in the mediation of these descending effects. It is proposed that the rostral ventral medullary projections provide a path through which antinociceptive effects of the anterior pretectal nucleus are mediated to the spinal cord.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Sympathetic skin response (SSR) is abnormal in multiple sclerosis.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7248744", "authors": ["Elie, B", "Louboutin, JP"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Muscle & nerve", "abstract": "As the function of the autonomic nervous system is often compromised in multiple sclerosis (MS), different standardized tests are used to detect disseminated abnormalities in cardiovascular autonomic functions. sympathetic skin response (SSR), a slow wave generated in deep layers of the skin, is induced by reflex activation of sudomotor sympathetic efferent fibers.

In this study a specific polyclonal antiserum to dephosphin was used to investigate its distribution in rat brain by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Immunoblots of various organs of the rat showed that dephosphin was detectable only in the whole brain and not in the testes, lung, kidney, adrenals, heart, liver or skeletal muscle. Immunoblotting of various regions of the brain revealed high levels of dephosphin, particularly in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, but its absence from the anterior pituitary. Synaptosomes were prepared from these three regions and labelled with 32Pi for 60 min, followed by incubation in control or 41 mM K+ depolarizing buffer. Dephosphin was present in each region and was stoichiometrically dephosphorylated by depolarization, indicating the presence and regulation of dephosphin in intact cerebellar nerve terminals. The cerebellum was selected for detailed study, using conventional light and confocal microscopy, owing to its ordered and well-characterized structure. Immunostaining was abundant within the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei, but almost entirely absent from the medulla. In the cortex many neuronal cells contained dephosphin-like immunoreactivity which was also evident in perikarya, axons, and nerve terminals. Dephosphin-like immunoreactivity was not detected in the radial Bergman glial cells. The greatest concentrations were observed in synaptic terminals, particularly in granular layer glomeruli and basket cell terminals surrounding Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites. Dephosphin therefore appears to be exclusive to neuronal tissue, but is distributed widely throughout the brain. It is located in many neuronal cell types of the cerebellum and may be particularly enriched in synaptic terminals, where it is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. This distribution suggests a role for dephosphin in synaptic vesicle cycling in nerve terminals.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "64", "title": "Characterization of synaptic connections between cortex and deep nuclei of the rat cerebellum in vitro.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "1450946", "authors": ["Mouginot, D", "G\u00e4hwiler, BH"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "Intracellular recordings were used to characterize the inhibitory synapses formed by Purkinje cells on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei of the rat. This work was performed on organotypic cerebellar cultures where functional connections between Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar neurons are formed de novo. After blocking ionotropic excitatory amino acid, and GABAA receptors with 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione,D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and bicuculline, respectively, the majority of deep cerebellar neurons fired spontaneously without accommodation. This tonic firing was linearly dependent on membrane potential and was abolished with hyperpolarization. Bath application of muscimol and baclofen reversibly hyperpolarized deep cerebellar nuclei cells. In the presence of excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists, field stimulation within the Purkinje cell layer induced monosynaptic inhibitory potentials in deep cerebellar neurons that were graded and completely blocked by bicuculline. Inhibitory potential amplitudes were not markedly reduced during fast repetitive stimulation of Purkinje cells, and the resulting hyperpolarization was not affected by the competitive GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 35348. A single inhibitory potential temporarily interrupted trains of action potentials induced in deep cerebellar cells by short depolarizing pulses. Trains of five inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, evoked at 20 Hz, induced a hyperpolarization which transiently blocked the spontaneous firing of deep cerebellar cells. The efficiency to block action potential discharges depended on the frequency of evoked inhibitory potentials. Bath application of bicuculline induced burst discharges in the control solution. When the excitatory amino acid receptors were pharmacologically blocked, bicuculline depolarized deep cerebellar neurons inducing sustained action potential discharges. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, bicuculline abolished miniature inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and resulted in a membrane depolarization of deep cerebellar cells. We conclude that deep cerebellar neurons isolated from synaptic inputs display a pacemaker-like activity. Although these neurons possess GABAA and GABAB receptors, we confirm that only GABAA receptors were involved in the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, even with high frequency stimulation. The amplitude of evoked inhibitory potentials was weakly frequency-dependent, thus allowing a powerful inhibition of the pacemaker-like activity by trains of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.

SCT stimulation monosynaptically excites the apical dendrites of deep laminae (V-VI) pyramidal neurons, while CAL afferents drive these same cells via synapses on their basal dendrites. In contrast, most superficial laminae (II/III-IV) pyramids appear to be driven polysynaptically via ascending axonal collaterals of deep pyramids. In slices retaining these connectivities, we contrasted characteristics of synaptic plasticity in superficial vs deep laminae field and intracellular potentials evoked by conditioning stimuli given at frequencies of 100, 20, 8, 5 and 1 Hz. Tetanic stimulation (100 Hz) of SCT or CAL yielded homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) of each pathway, while stimulus trains of 8-20 Hz did not. 1-5 Hz stimulation of SCT and CAL elicited homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength in each pathway. Associative LTD was induced by interleaving 5 Hz pulses to the SCT pathway with 100 Hz theta-burst stimulation of CAL, but was not induced when these stimulus loci were switched. Heterosynaptic non-associative LTD was also observed in the alternate pathway following tetanization of either SCT or CAL. In all cases, LTP and LTD were observed only in deep laminae recordings. In contrast, superficial records showed only paired-pulse facilitation and short-term post-tetanic potentiation. In in vivo experiments in anaesthetized rats, PCC responses to SCT stimulation were contrasted with responses to stimulation of anteroventral and anterodorsal thalamic nuclei (AV/AD). SCT-elicited field potentials closely resembled those evoked in the slice, with maximal amplitude tuned to the 4-8 Hz frequency band. AV/AD stimulation elicited field potentials which were not frequency tuned. Overall, these data suggest that the acute circuit properties of PCC superficial laminae, modulated by thalamic input and synaptic plasticity in deep laminae, can transform hippocampal synaptic inflow before relaying it to extracingulate targets.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for neuropathic pain.", "issue": "1-4", "pmid": "2052386", "authors": ["Tasker, RR", "Vilela Filho, O"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "Paresthesia-producing (PP), but not periventricular grey (PVG) deep brain stimulation (DBS) proved effective in steady neuropathic pain in 25 patients receiving both, regardless of the PP site stimulated, but PVG-DBS suppressed allodynia or hyperpathia in 3 cases of stroke-induced pain.

When the eyes and pinnae are in primary position, the neural map of auditory space is in rough topographic alignment with the map of visual space, and if the auditory map is based solely on headpinna coordinates, any changes in eye position in the orbit will cause misalignment of the maps. We investigated the effects of eye position on the response of sound-sensitive neurons in the SC of cats because previous work on cats and on monkeys had suggested the possibility of species differences in the representation of auditory signals in the SC. We also investigated the effects of eye position on the accuracy of saccades to auditory, visual, and bimodal stimuli. All studies were conducted in alert, trained cats with the head restrained in a fixed position. Neuronal and behavioral responses were studied during periods when the eyes were steadily directed to different positions relative to the position of the sound. Cats showed partial compensation for eye position in making saccades, regardless of the modality of the target, and they showed similar patterns of error in saccades to auditory and visual targets. These behavioral data are consistent with coding the location of visual and auditory targets in the same coordinate system. In the vast majority of intermediate-layer neurons, eye position significantly affected the number of spikes evoked by sound stimuli. For most of these neurons, changes in eye position produced significant shifts in the speaker location producing maximal response. In some neurons, eye position significantly facilitated the magnitude of neuronal response evoked by sounds from a variety of speaker locations. Because few pinna movements could be detected, in is unlikely that these changes in neuronal response could be due to changes in the position of the pinnae. Our results indicate that the deep layers of the SC contain an eye-centered representation of sound location.

Electrodes were placed bilaterally near the cortical projection of the area centralis. The horizontal separation of the recording tips was approximately 2 mm and approximately 300 microns, respectively. The area of the visual field providing input to the recording site (receptive field) was determined by measuring the field potentials generated by contrast reversal of high-contrast, achromatic bar gratings. Five-degree-diameter grating patches were presented individually over a large area of the visual field. The gratings were contrast-reversed at 4, 6 or 10 Hz, while also being swept in spatial frequency between 0.56 and 5.24 c/deg. The receptive fields were approximately 20 deg across or more, substantially larger than expected on the basis of cortical retinotopy. Responses were also elicited by stimulation of the hemi-field contralateral to that contributing to the classical receptive field, implicating the presence of a callosal projection. The large, spatially distributed receptive fields consisted of patches of high and low sensitivity. Continuous cortical infusion of either 100 microM tetrodotoxin or 10 mM muscimol at the recording site totally suppressed the transcortically recorded field potentials, proving that the local field potentials were generated postsynaptically. The present findings suggest that a cluster of cortical cells near the projection site of the area centralis receives input from remote cortical regions to an extent that is comparable with that of anatomically demonstrated long-range lateral connections.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "On the agonistic display of the Siamese fighting fish. I. The frontal display apparatus.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "3656165", "authors": ["Ma, PM"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Brain, behavior and evolution", "abstract": "The agonistic behavior of the Siamese fighting fish has long been a popular subject for ethologists. While this behavior is well documented, its physiological basis is still poorly understood. One of the most important components of this behavior is the frontal display, in which a fish faces its opponent directly with tonically extended gill covers. As a first step towards establishing this display as a model for behavioral physiology, the musculoskeletal structure of the frontal display apparatus is examined. The opercular bones and the opercular abductor, the opercular dilator muscle, appear to have undergone adaptive modifications that facilitate the display. The opercular bone rotates around the hyomandibular bone through a ball-and-socket joint. Due partly to a reduction of its articulation with the preopercular bone, the operculum can rotate as much as 90 degrees around this joint. The opercular dilator muscle consists of three parts: a deep belly--DO alpha, and two superficial bellies--DO beta and DO gamma. The three portions have different origins, but all three insert on the lateral surface of the opercular bone just dorsal to the spheroidal joint. In comparison, the opercular dilator muscle of the sunfish and the goldfish lacks the superficial bellies. Innervation of this muscle is derived from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, all three portions are innervated by axons from the same fascicle, suggesting that they are embryologically related. The superficial bellies consist of uniform, large muscle fibers. The deep belly consists of an external group of large fibers around a central tendon, and an internal group of small fibers. Enzyme histochemistry shows that the external group of fibers consists mostly of fast-twitch fibers, whereas the internal group consists of slow, oxidative fibers. Direct stimulation demonstrates that all bellies can mediate opercular extension. The architectural and biochemical differences among the three portions suggest that they are functionally not equivalent. The fast-fatiguing muscles may mediate the initiation, while the large fibers of the superficial bellies and the small oxidative fibers of the deep belly may be involved in the maintenance of the display.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "104", "title": "Cerebellar cortex and eyeblink conditioning: bilateral regulation of conditioned responses.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "3714289", "authors": ["Gruart, A", "Yeo, CH"], "year": "1995", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Using extended preoperative conditioning to ensure high levels of learning, we confirmed that unilateral lesions of lobules HVI and ansiform lobe impaired conditioned responses (CRs) previously established to an auditory conditioned stimulus, but did not prevent some relearning with post-operative retraining. Bilateral lesions of HVI and ansiform lobe produced similar impairments of CRs, but also prevented subsequent relearning. Unilateral cortical lesions produced significant enhancement of unconditioned response (UR) amplitudes to periorbital electrical stimulation. Bilateral cortical lesions enhanced UR amplitudes to a lesser extent. Because there was no correlation between the degree of CR impairment and UR enhancement across the unilateral and bilateral lesion groups, the suggestion that the lesions impaired CRs due to general effects upon performance, rather than due to losses of learning, is not supported. Both sides of the cerebellar cortex contribute towards learning a unilaterally trained CR. This finding is important for the re-interpretation of unilateral, reversible inactivation studies that have found no involvement of the cerebellar deep nuclei in the acquisition of NMR conditioning. In addition, we found conditioning-dependent modifications of unconditioned responses that were particularly apparent at low intensities of periorbital electrical stimulation.

Using the GL-1 rat monoclonal antibody (mAb), we monitored expression of B7-2 on mouse leukocytes with an emphasis on dendritic cells. By cytofluorography, little or no B7-2 was detected on most cell types isolated from spleen, thymus, peritoneal cavity, skin, marrow, and blood. However, expression of B7-2 could be upregulated in culture. In the case of epidermal and spleen dendritic cells, which become highly immunostimulatory for T cells during a short period of culture, the upregulation of B7-2 was dramatic and did not require added stimuli. Lipopolysaccharide did not upregulate B7-2 levels on dendritic cells, in contrast to macrophages and B cells.

Of these accessory molecules, B7-2 was a major species that increased in culture, implying a key role for B7-2 in the functional maturation of dendritic cells. B7-2 was the main (> 90%) CTLA-4 ligand on mouse dendritic cells. When we applied GL-1 to tissue sections of a dozen different organs, clear-cut staining with B7-2 antigen was found in many. B7-2 staining was noted on liver Kupffer cells, interstitial cells of heart and lung, and profiles in the submucosa of the esophagus. B7-2 staining was minimal in the kidney and in the nonlymphoid regions of the gut, and was not observed at all in the brain.

Type I EPV (eye position and velocity) neurons were located mainly in the posterior part of the fastigial nucleus and activated antidromically almost exclusively from the medial longitudinal fasciculus close to the oculomotor complex. These neurons, reported here for the first time, increased their firing rate during saccades and eye fixations towards the contralateral hemifield. Their position sensitivity to eye fixations in the horizontal plane was 5.3 +/- 2.6 spikes s-1 deg-1 (mean +/- S.D.). Eye velocity sensitivity during horizontal saccades was 0.71 +/- 0.52 spikes s-1 deg-1 s-1. Variability of their firing rate during a given eye fixation was higher than that shown by abducens motoneurons. 4. Type I EPV neurons increased their firing rate during ipsilateral head rotations at 0.5 Hz with a mean phase lead over eye position of 95.3 +/- 9.5 deg. They were also activated by contralateral optokinetic stimulation at 30 deg s-1. Their sensitivity to eye position and velocity in the horizontal plane during vestibular and optokinetic stimuli yielded values similar to those obtained for spontaneous eye movements. 5. Type II neurons were located in both fastigial and dentate nuclei and were activated antidromically from the restiform body, the medial longitudinal fasciculus close to the oculomotor complex, the red nucleus and the pontine nuclei. Type II neurons were not related to spontaneous eye movements. These neurons increased their firing rate in response to contralateral head rotation and during ipsilateral optokinetic stimulation, and decreased it with the oppositely directed movements. 6. Saccade-related neurons were located mostly in the fastigial and dentate nuclei. Fastigial neurons were activated antidromically from the medial longitudinal fasciculus, while dentate neurons were activated from the red nucleus. These neurons fired a burst of spikes whose duration was significantly related to saccade duration. Dentate neurons responded during the omni-directional saccades, while some fastigial neurons fired more actively during contralateral saccades. 7.

The three-dimensional, binocular eye movements evoked by electrical microstimulation of the cerebellar flocculus of alert, pigmented rabbits were recorded using the scleral search coil technique. The components of these eye movements were obtained in reference to an orthogonal coordinate system consisting of a vertical axis and two horizontal axes at 45 degrees and 135 degrees azimuth. The azimuth coordinate was taken to increase to both sides from the 0 degrees reference in the direction of the nose. 2. Eye movements were evoked most readily by stimulation (0.2-ms pulses at 200 Hz for 1 s, intensity < or = 20 microA) at loci in the deep granular layer and the white matter. They consisted of slow (5-20 deg/s) movements. The responses were either binocular, with the eye ipsilateral to the stimulated flocculus usually having the larger amplitude, or were monocular, in which case they were restricted to the ipsilateral eye. 3. The evoked responses were classified according to the combination of the largest measured component of rotation for the two eyes and its sense of rotation (clockwise, CW, or counterclockwise, CCW). Seventy-eight percent of the evoked eye movements could be placed in one of two classes. For one of these classes the largest response component was a short-latency abduction of the ipsilateral eye about its vertical axis (19%), whereas for the other class (59%), the largest response component was a short-latency CCW rotation of the ipsilateral (left) eye about its 135 degrees axis. This response was frequently (50%) accompanied by a smaller short-latency CW rotation of the contralateral (right) eye about its 45 degrees axis. 4. The two main classes of three-dimensional eye movements are associated differentially with anatomically distinguishable compartments that are revealed by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. Of the five anatomically distinguishable compartments in the floccular white matter, three are predominant. The middle of these three compartments is associated with the vertical axis class of movements, whereas the two adjacent compartments are associated with the 135 degrees class of eye movements. The eye movement relation of the other two, smaller compartments, was not determined. 5. The spatial orientation of the rotation axes of the two main classes of evoked eye movements closely corresponds to that of the preferred axes of the visual climbing fiber input to the flocculus.

Since they are generally longer in duration than the interstimulus interval (ISI), the standard experiment is a short conditioning train of regular light or dark flashes (1-20 Hz) whose termination elicits the OSP. Tectal surface OSPs after trains > 7 Hz have 2 major positive peaks, P120-140 and P220-250 after the due-time of the first omission; after < 7 Hz down to the minimum of 1.5 Hz only the slower peak appears. Some deep tectal loci also have one to three 100 msec wide negative waves peaking at variable times from 200 to 1300 msec. Forebrain OSPs in DC and DVR are approximately 30 msec later and often include induced 17-25 Hz oscillations, not phase-locked and attenuated in averages. Both tectal and forebrain OSP main waves tend toward a constant latency after the due-time, over a wide range of ISIs, as though the system expects a stimulus on schedule. Jitter of ISI around the mean does not greatly reduce the OSP. At all loci higher conditioning rates cause the amplitudes of the steady state response (SSR) VEPs to decline and of the OSPs to increase. Some similarities and correlations of regional amplitude fluctuations between OSPs and VEPs are noted. The OSP dynamics are consistent with the hypothesis of a postinhibitory rebound of temporally specific VEP components increasingly inhibited with higher stimulation rates; much of this response is retinal but each higher brain level further modulates. OSPs in this reptile are similar to those known in fish and to the \"high frequency\" type in humans, quite distinct in properties from the \"low frequency\" OSPs.

A total of 92 nonnociceptive and nociceptive Vc neurons was recorded in urethan/alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Each neuron was functionally classified as low-threshold mechanoceptive (LTM), wide dynamic range (WDR), nociceptive-specific (NS), nociceptive convergent with both skin and deep inputs (S+D), or deep nociceptive (D); the LTM neurons could be subdivided as rapidly adapting (RA) or slowly adapting (SA). Conditioning stimulation was applied to histologically verified sites in PBA and NRM. 2. The spontaneous or evoked activity of all classes of neurons could be inhibited by PBA as well as by NRM stimulation, but generally the incidence and magnitude of inhibition were lower for the LTM neurons. Occasionally, facilitation of neuronal activity was also produced by PBA and NRM stimulation. 3. The spontaneous activity of 11 LTM neurons (6 RA, 5 SA), 13 nociceptive neurons (6 WDR, 7 NS), and 5 D neurons was tested with stimulation of PBA or NRM or both. LTM spontaneous activity was more significantly inhibited by NRM stimulation than by PBA stimulation, whereas both NRM and PBA stimulation had similar and significant inhibitory effects on NS, WDR, and D neurons. 4. The evoked nonnociceptive responses of 28 LTM neurons (16 RA, 12 SA) and of 6 WDR neurons were also tested with stimulation of PBA or NRM or both.

There was a significant difference in potency between PBA- and NRM-induced inhibition, but no difference in the magnitude of inhibitory effects among NS, WDR, and D neurons. For both PBA and NRM conditioning stimulation, graded increases in intensities of stimulation produced linear increases in inhibitory effects on nociceptive responses; an increase in stimulation frequency from 5 to 400 Hz also produced increases in inhibition of the nociceptive responses. 6.

Slices of tissue were taken in the horizontal plane through the caudo-ventral pole of the cerebral hemisphere of 9- to 10-day-old rats. Such slices maintain the entorhinal cortex in continuity with the hippocampus and intervening retrohippocampal areas. However, because of the dorsal inclination of the entorhino-hippocampal projection fibres in situ, the segments of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus contained within each individual horizontal slice were disconnected from each other. During subsequent culture, the formation of fibre connections between the entorhinal area and the hippocampal complex was studied by the extracellular and intracellular anterograde transport of biocytin or biotin dextran, the retrograde transport of biotin dextran or carbocyanine dyes, and by electrical stimulation and recording. For the first 24 h after taking the slice, there were no entorhinal projections beyond the deep white matter, and no fibres reached the hippocampus or dentate gyrus. After 3 days in culture a small number of growing fibres had perforated the subiculum and entered the target areas. Between 6 and 14 days these projections increased and matured. As in the normal adult brain, entorhinal layer II stellate cells projected correctly to the dentate gyrus and hippocampal field CA3, whereas layer III pyramidal cells projected to hippocampal field CA1 and the subiculum. The new fibres grew along both alvear and perforant pathways. Anterograde and retrograde labelling showed that the reciprocal projections from the pyramidal cells of the subiculum and CA1 to the entorhinal area had also been severed at the time of taking the slices, and had similarly regenerated. Our results demonstrate that by taking tissue slices in appropriate planes it is possible to study the regeneration of axons in the tissue environment through which they normally run. This approach avoids the use of coculture and the concomitant difficulties associated with the need for fibres to cross a coculture interface.

This report describes experiments designed to determine whether cells in this area of the brain exhibit changes in neural activity during classical conditioning that can be related to these learned heart rate changes. Thus, multiple- and single-unit activity was recorded from area 32 in rabbits during Pavlovian heart rate (HR) conditioning. In the first experiment, neuronal discharge recorded from chronically implanted multiple-unit electrodes in the superficial and deep layers of area 32 increased systematically in response to the presentation of tone conditioned stimuli (CS) paired with paraorbital electric shock as the unconditioned stimulus (US). This tone-evoked increase in multiple-unit activity (MUA) closely paralleled the acquisition of the decelerative HR conditioned response in animals that received paired CS/US presentations, but was of smaller amplitude in animals given unpaired CS/US presentations. Tone-evoked increases in MUA also occurred during tone-alone presentations prior to training, but this activity declined over trials. During extinction, CS-evoked MUA increases also declined over trials. These findings suggest that the CS-evoked increase in neuronal activity in area 32 was associatively produced. A second experiment examined the CS-evoked response of single units (n = 98) in area 32 during differential Pavlovian conditioning, in which one tone (CS+) was consistently followed by the paraorbital shock US and a second tone (CS-) was not. Four types of cells were found: (1) 32% of the cells studied showed no change in response to either CS+ or CS- presentation, (2) 48% showed CS-evoked increases to either CS+ or CS-, (3) 14% showed CS-evoked decreases to CS+ or CS-, and (4) 7% showed a biphasic response, in which an increase was followed by a decrease in activity. These cell types are similar to those previously found in the more dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (area 24) and frontal eyefields (area 8). However, a major difference between the present findings and those of our previous studies of areas 8 and 24 is that in several instances changes in CS-evoked activity in area 32 were significantly greater in response to the CS- than to the CS+, suggesting that some cells in the prelimbic region may code the absence of aversive stimulation, that is, a period of relative \"safety.\"", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "Spinothalamic and spinohypothalamic tract neurons in the cervical enlargement of rats.

Employing an immunogold-silver intensification technique we showed that one of the physiologically characterized cells was immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). 2. Axo-axonic cells were encountered in the dentate gyrus (n = 5) as well as subfields CA3 (n = 2) and CA1 (n = 10).

Their axons ramified densely in the cell body layers and in the subjacent stratum oriens or hilus, respectively.

These neurons were identified as deep pyramidal cells located in cortical layer III, with characteristic pyramidal/ovoid shaped cell bodies, prominent apical dendrites with branches extending to the surface, and extensive basal dendritic trees. The cells showed a regular spiking pattern in response to injected depolarizing current, with no evidence of bursting behaviour. Nine cells (termed type 2), were strongly excited by oxotremorine-M, but only generated a weak depolarizing afterpotential (< 5 mV) following stimulation. These neurons (located in layer III or at layer II-III border) had a variable, non-pyramidal morphology with either a fusiform/tripolar, stellate/multipolar or bipolar/bi-tufted appearance, respectively. Apart from a more prominent post-spike afterhyperpolarization observed in some type 2 cells, their resting membrane properties and firing patterns were indistinguishable from those of type 1 responding cells. Twelve cells (termed type 3) showed little or no excitatory response to oxotremorine-M, and never generated a post-stimulus slow afterdepolarization. These cells (within compact layer II) had the morphological features of superficial pyramidal cells, typified by their short apical trunks and well-developed apical dendritic trees. They could be distinguished electrophysiologically by their ability to show spike fractionation during injection of large depolarizing current pulses. The morphology and laminar position of neurobiotin-filled cells was also compared with those of cells stained by the Golgi-Cox method. Some factors that may have contributed to the observed differences in muscarinic response profile are discussed.

Twenty-four hours following FOR, the numbers of neurons labelled for NOS and NDP and the density of NDP containing nerve fiber varicosities significantly increased in sDH of the ipsilateral L3-L4 segments.

While the onset of stimulus-dependent DG uptake is the result of the establishment of functional projections up to that station, the subsequent changes in size of the responding areas may well be due to the partial elimination of terminals, the maturation of local inhibitory circuits, and/or the development of cortical projections to the nuclei of termination and to the thalamic relay.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[The efficacy of low-intensity exposures in hypertension].", "issue": "1", "pmid": "7525841", "authors": ["Kniazeva, TA", "Otto, MP", "Markarov, GS", "Donova, OM", "Markarova, IS"], "year": "", "journal": "Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebno\u012d fizichesko\u012d kultury", "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that tuberculoventral and cartwheel cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus as well as a group of stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus are likely to be glycinergic.

Neurons with presaccadic activity encoding saccade vectors are topographically organized and form a \"motor map.\" Recently, neurons with fixation-related activity have been recorded at the collicular rostral pole, at the area centralis representation or fixation area. Another collicular function which deals with the maintenance of fixation behavior by means of active inhibition of orientation commands was then suggested. We tested that hypothesis as it relates to the suppression of gaze saccades (gaze = eye in space = eye in head + head in space) in the head-free cat by increasing the activity of the fixation cells at the rostral pole with electrical microstimulation. Long stimulation trains applied before gaze saccades delayed their initiation. Short stimuli, delivered during the gaze saccades, transiently interrupted both eye and head components. These results provide further support for a role in fixation behavior for collicular fixation neurons. Brainstem omnipause neurons also exhibit fixation-related activity and have been shown to receive a direct excitatory input from the superior colliculus. To determine whether the collicular projection to omnipause neurons arises from the fixation area, the deep layers of the superior colliculus were electrically stimulated either at the rostral pole including the fixation area or in more caudal regions where stimulation evokes orienting responses. Forty-nine neurons were examined in three cats. 61% of the neurons were found to be orthodromically excited by single-pulse stimulation of the rostral pole, whereas only 29% responded to caudal stimulation. In addition, stimuli delivered to the rostral pole activated, on average, omnipause neurons at shorter latencies and with lower currents than those applied in caudal regions.

Neuroanatomic and electrophysiologic data indicate that subiculocingulate tract (SCT) afferents monosynaptically excite apical dendrites of deep laminae (V-VI) neurons, evoking pure EPSPs, while superficial laminae (II/III-IV) neurons are driven polysynaptically, evoking a mixture of longer latency EPSPs and IPSPs. Consistent with this model, CSD analysis of field potential laminar profiles supports the conclusion that activation of excitatory subicular afferent terminal fields in superficial laminae of cingulate cortex elicits primary monosynaptic activation of apical dendrites of deep lamina (V-VI) pyramids. Subsequent EPSP propagation to the somata of these pyramids generated synchronous action potential discharges which appeared to elicit delayed polysynaptic activation of superficial laminae pyramids and interneurons. Latency differences between SCT-stimulus-evoked EPSPs and action potentials in superficial and deep laminae were minimized by stimulus train frequencies of 5-8 Hz, indicating that the proposed microcircuitry can show functional tuning at frequencies characteristic of hippocampal neuronal activity (theta).

When stepwise increasing stimuli were applied at the dorsal midbrain, hierarchically organized mean thresholds, spaced 10 microA apart, were observed for immobility, running and jumping defensive behaviours. The parallel threshold functions of these responses, ranked in the above order, denote that they have distinct output probabilities when induced with sequential stepwise increasing stimuli. In contrast, when single daily stimuli were given in a random order, virtually superimposed threshold functions were obtained for these defensive behaviours. In this case, since the same output probabilities would be expected for immobility, running and jumping behaviours, the defence system seems to operate in a state of maximum entropy. The above data suggest that the dorsal midbrain, including the deep collicular layers and the periaqueductal gray, may encode hierarchical or non-hierarchical defensive patterns which, respectively, mimic either the attentive behaviour of the prey watching the approaching predator or its chaotic behaviour when cornered by a sudden attack. On the other hand, whereas quite stable thresholds were observed for the somatic defensive responses when 5 stimulation sessions were repeated over 15 days, the defecation and micturition output underwent a marked and progressive lessening. Since these autonomic responses have long been considered as reliable indexes of fear, their attenuation throughout the repeated sessions could express the rat adaptation to fear by the recurrence of the aversive experience. Taken together, these data suggest that while short-term neuronal adaptation could be responsible for the hierarchical threshold structure of the short interval stepwise stimulation, long-term neuronal adaptation could underlie the selective decrease of defecation and micturition responses over repeated sessions of intracranial stimulation.", "pages": "174-9"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "[The effect of beta-carotene on the cytoplasmic membrane lipids of cells in rats under chronic gamma irradiation].", "issue": "10", "pmid": "7684435", "authors": ["Potekhina, NI", "Kolomi\u012dtseva, IK", "Zharikova, AD", "Vakulova, LA", "Zhidkova, TA", "Kuzin, AM"], "year": "1993", "journal": "Biulleten' eksperimental'no\u012d biologii i meditsiny", "abstract": "The authors systematically studied the release of the endogenous opioid peptides beta-endorphin and methionine (met)-enkephalin into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during deep brain stimulation in patients suffering from otherwise intractable chronic pain.

Connectivity patterns were deduced from current-source density (CSD) analyses of field potential depth profiles and were confirmed by anatomic data of retrograde cell labeling after focal injections of a fluorescent tracer. 2. According to the CSD distributions, horizontal axons in layer II/III provide strong monosynaptic input to dendrites of layer II and III pyramidal cells in a distant column, and weaker monosynaptic input to layer V and VI cells by synapsing on dendritic fields at the border of layer III and V and in deep layer V. When these pathways are activated, layer II/III cells may relay excitatory activity to upper and deep layer V, as well as to other cells in layer II/III of the same column. Axons arising from layer V provide monosynaptic input to pyramidal cells in all layers of neighboring columns, by synapsing in two dendritic fields: one in the superficial layers and the other in middle layer V. Activation of these pathways may generate a disynaptic intracolumnar input from layer II/III cells to middle layer V, as well as to other cells in layer II/III. Similar patterns of synaptic activity were elicited by stimulation from 0.45 to 2 mm distal to the recorded column. There were no apparent differences between young and adult rats in the connectivity patterns revealed by the CSD analyses. 3.
