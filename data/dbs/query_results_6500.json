Head tremor scores prior to surgery were compared with scores at 3, 6, and 12 months postimplant with stimulation \"on\" and \"off.\" The 3-month evaluations were blinded for 24 patients and all others were open-label. There was a significant improvement in head tremor at all postimplant evaluations compared with baseline.

DBS has produced few side-effects, which are usually reversible. More recently, DBS has been applied to other movement disorders (akinesia and rigidity, dyskinesias, dystonia), using new targets: internal pallidum, subthalamic nucleus. These targets have been selected on the basis of neurophysiological or anatomo-clinical data suggesting they could be effective. Control of L-Dopa peak-dose dyskinesias by thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus (V.im.) stimulation has been reported by the Lille team, but not by the Grenoble team. We therefore re-examined all teleradioanatomical data of both teams, and compared them with the therapeutic effects. Location of 99 monopolar electrodes of thalamic stimulation, applied to treat parkinsonian tremor, has been retrospectively measured. The Lille team included 21 patients (22 electrodes); the Grenoble team included 52 patients (74 electrodes). L-Dopa dyskinesias were suppressed in all 9 patients in Lille, and improved clearly in only 8 out of 32 patients in Grenoble. The mean center of electrodes was significantly different between both teams, being deeper, more posterior and medial in Lille. This did not correspond to the coordinates of the V.im., but seems to be closer to those of the centromedian and parafascicular complex (CM-Pf), according to stereotactic atlases. Considering only the dyskinetic patients, the therapeutic effects on L-Dopa dyskinesias were related to the differences observed in the electrode position, but not to the team membership. Improvement of L-Dopa dyskinesias was significantly associated with deeper and more medial placement of electrodes. Retrospective analysis of ventriculographic data confirmed that the electrode position and therapeutic effects of DBS are strongly related. Our study suggested that CM-Pf stimulation could control both tremor and L-Dopa dyskinesias. This hypothesis is consistent with neuro-anatomical data showing that CM-Pf is connected to internal pallidum, the stimulation of which controls specifically L-Dopa dyskinesias.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "82", "title": "Features of cortically evoked swallowing in the awake primate (Macaca fascicularis).", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10482767", "authors": ["Martin, RE", "Kemppainen, P", "Masuda, Y", "Yao, D", "Murray, GM", "Sessle, BJ"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Although the cerebral cortex has been implicated in the control of swallowing, the output organization of the cortical swallowing representation, and features of cortically evoked swallowing, remain unclear. The present study defined the output features of the primate \"cortical swallowing representation\" with intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) applied within the lateral sensorimotor cortex. In four hemispheres of two awake monkeys, microelectrode penetrations were made at </=1-mm intervals, initially within the face primary motor cortex (face-MI), and subsequently within the cortical regions immediately rostral, lateral, and caudal to MI. Two ICMS pulse trains [35-ms train, 0.2-ms pulses at 333 Hz, </=30 microA (short train stimulus, T/S); 3- to 4-s train, 0.2-ms pulses at 50 Hz, </=60 microA (continuous stimulus, C/S)] were applied at </=500-micron intervals along each microelectrode penetration to a depth of 8-10 mm, and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded simultaneously from various orofacial and laryngeal muscles. Evoked orofacial movements, including swallowing, were verified by EMG analysis, and T/S and C/S movement thresholds were determined. Effects of varying ICMS intensity on swallow-related EMG properties were examined by applying suprathreshold C/S at selected intracortical sites. EMG patterns of swallows evoked from various cortical regions were compared with those of natural swallows recorded as the monkeys swallowed liquid and solid material. Results indicated that swallowing was evoked by C/S at approximately 20% of 1,569 intracortical sites where ICMS elicited an orofacial motor response in both hemispheres of the two monkeys, typically at C/S intensities </=30 microA. In contrast, swallowing was not evoked by T/S in either monkey. Swallowing was evoked from four cortical regions: the ICMS-defined face-MI, the face primary somatosensory cortex (face-SI), the region lateral and anterior to face-MI corresponding to the cortical masticatory area (CMA), and an area >5 mm deep to the cortical surface corresponding to both the white matter underlying the CMA and the frontal operculum; EMG patterns of swallows elicited from these four cortical regions showed some statistically significant differences. Whereas swallowing ONLY was evoked at some sites, particularly within the deep cortical area, swallowing was more frequently evoked together with other orofacial responses including rhythmic jaw movements. Increasing ICMS intensity increased the magnitude, and decreased the latency, of the swallow-related EMG burst in the genioglossus muscle at some sites. These findings suggest that a number of distinct cortical foci may participate in the initiation and modulation of the swallowing synergy as well as in integrating the swallow within the masticatory sequence.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "141", "title": "Direct stereotactic MRI location in the globus pallidus for chronic stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "10481788", "authors": ["Lemaire, JJ", "Durif, F", "Boire, JY", "Debilly, B", "Irthum, B", "Chazal, J"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "We evaluated the direct location in the globus pallidus (GP) under stereotactic MRI (sMRI) guidance in five parkinsonians treated with chronic deep brain stimulation (four bilaterally). The sMRI consisted of three orthogonal (horizontal, frontal, sagittal) sets of images obtained with a stereotactic frame and its localiser. The sMRI was coupled with ventriculography to compare the location with the classic indirect method based on commissural landmarks. The target was defined on T2-weighted slices in the anterior part of the medial GP, at the vertex of the nucleus. It was reached via one track with a semi-micro-electrode and step by step high frequency stimulation, then replaced by a quadripolar electrode once we located the site enabling the optimal clinical improvement. Stereotactic x-rays localised the final position of the electrode. A company software matched sMRI, ventriculography, and peroperative (perop) x-rays, with reference to the stereotactic location boxes. We analysed the effects of acute (perop) and chronic (six-month follow-up) stimulation of active plots (acplots), i.e. leading to optimal clinical improvement. Three distances with reference to the acplots were measured both on sMRI and ventriculography: the laterality from the median sagittal plane of the third ventricle; the anterior position from the midpoint of the intercommissural line (Icl), and the vertical position with regard to the Icl. We then compared the differences in measurements (n = 64) with the Bland and Altman method. The mean difference was 0.09 mm with 95% of the values between +/- 1 mm, but only the laterality had a statistically significant agreement (all the differences included between +/- two times the standard deviation of the mean). The acplots distances from the dorsal, ventral, and medial boundaries of GP (defined by manual surrounding on frontal and horizontal planes) were measured on sMRI. With one exception, the acplots were all included in the nucleus. The six-month acplots were located dorsally with reference to the perop ones. Clinical benefit at six-months follow-up showed results comparable to the literature.

Lesioning or deep-brain stimulation of the STN can alleviate resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. The STN and its target nuclei display synchronized oscillatory burst discharge at low frequencies, some of which correlate with tremor, but the mechanism underlying this synchronized bursting is unknown. Here we show that the excitatory STN and inhibitory, external globus pallidus (GPe) form a feedback system that engages in synchronized bursting. In mature organotypic cortex-striatum-STN-GPe cultures, neurons in the STN and GPe spontaneously produce synchronized oscillating bursts at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.8 Hz. Pallidal lesion abolishes this bursting, whereas cortical lesion favours bursting at 0.8 Hz. Pallidal bursts, although weaker than STN bursts, were required for synchronized oscillatory burst generation by recruitment of subthalmic rebound excitation. We propose that the STN and GPe constitute a central pacemaker modulated by striatal inhibition of GPe neurons.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus on memory and executive functions in Parkinson's disease. Sixty-two patients were assessed before and after 3 to 6 months of chronic bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (n = 49) or internal globus pallidus (n = 13). The neuropsychological tests used were the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, the Grober and Buschke Verbal Learning Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, category and literal fluency, graphic and motor series, the Stroop Test, and the Trail Making Test. Mood was evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory. Only 4 of 25 cognitive variables were affected by deep brain stimulation. Under stimulation, performance improved for Parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, but there was a deterioration in literal and total lexical fluency. There was also a mild but significant improvement in mood. It may therefore be concluded that stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus does not change the overall cognitive performance in Parkinson's disease and does not greatly affect the functioning of subcorticofrontal loops involved in cognition in humans.

In younger patients (aged <50 years), the strategy is to use a dopamine D2 agonist as monotherapy and then to add levodopa treatment when the parkinsonian symptoms progress. In older patients, (aged >50 years to <70 years), the therapeutic approach is to use early combination therapy of levodopa and a D2 agonist. The treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesias must be considered in regard to the subtype and the severity of dyskinesias, and the patient. The general approach to the treatment of peak dose dyskinesias is to maintain dopamine brain stimulation at as stable a level as possible by keeping plasma and brain levodopa concentrations in the therapeutic range (above the therapeutic threshold but below the dyskinesia threshold). An appropriate strategy is to reduce the individual dose of levodopa, to spread out the daily levodopa dose and/or to try treatment with the sustained-release form of the drug. Combination treatment with the standard and sustained-release levodopa formulations is also possible. Stopping selegiline (deprenyl) therapy may reduce dyskinesias; reducing the dose of, or stopping treatment with, a dopamine agonist may also be beneficial. Anti-dyskinetic drugs such as amantadine, buspirone, fluoxetine, propanolol and principally clozapine may be used. In severe dyskinesias, apomorphine infusion may be tried. In refractory dyskinesia, surgical procedures such as pallidotomy and chronic deep brain stimulation (globus pallidus/subthalamic nucleus) may be proposed. Theoretically, treatment of diphasic dyskinesias requires the maintenance of plasma levodopa concentrations above the dyskinesia threshold. However, this approach leads to constant and severe dyskinesia after only a few weeks of treatment. Thus, the strategy used to treat diphasic dyskinesia is close to the treatment of peak-dose dyskinesias. Apomorphine (or the liquid form of levodopa) may be helpful to prevent diphasic dyskinesias. In selected patients, a midday rest in the 'off' phase may decrease the duration of dyskinesia. Treatment of early morning dystonia is based on the addition to the regimen of the sustained release formulation of levodopa before bedtime. Liquid levodopa and apomorphine injection may be used just before the appearance of the dystonic posture. Botulinum toxin may be helpful in severe dystonia.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Impact of deep brain stimulation on upper limb akinesia in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "6381653", "authors": ["Brown, RG", "Dowsey, PL", "Brown, P", "Jahanshahi, M", "Pollak, P", "Benabid, AL", "Rodriguez-Oroz, MC", "Obeso, J", "Rothwell, JC"], "year": "1999", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "abstract": "In published series of patients who undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus the effects of unilateral stimulation on contralateral limb tremor have been reported.

Fos-like immunoreactive cells were labeled in primary auditory brain stem regions. The distribution of labeled cells was restricted to regions known to be cochleotopically related to the stimulated region of the scala tympani. Some labeled cells were observed at 2x electrically evoked auditory brain stem response threshold. The number, density and spatial distribution of labeled cells were quantified in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus, and found to increase with increasing level of stimulation. For 50-micros pulses, the location of labeled neurons remained reasonably restricted to narrow bands within each region until the 1Ox level of stimulation (20 dB above electrically evoked auditory brain stem response threshold) was reached. While a monotonic increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity with increasing stimulus level was observed in most nuclei, for cells of the superficial layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, a non-monotonic change with increasing stimulus level was seen. This dorsal cochlear nucleus non-monotonicity may indicate that, at higher levels of stimulation, a secondary indirect inhibitory input, probably associated with activation of deep layer dorsal cochlear nucleus cells, reduces excitatory responses at the superficial layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Electrically evoked auditory brain stem response and Fos expression showed parallel changes as a function of stimulus level and pulse duration. The data indicate that discrete activation of cell populations within the central auditory pathways can occur with bipolar electrical stimulation to the highest levels of stimulation typically useful in humans. The data also indicate a close, but not identical, quantitative relationship between Fos-like immunoreactivity and electrophysiological response amplitude. These findings support the view that a study of Fos-like immunoreactivity can provide a powerful and quantitative tool for study of the dynamic response characteristics of cells of the central auditory system to electrical stimulation at suprathreshold levels. The data suggest that there is a monotonic increase in the number of neurons responsive to intracochlear electrical stimulation as a function of stimulus level, at least through the upper half of the dynamic range, but that this increase does not result in a complete loss of spatial selectivity. Coupled with previous psychophysical studies, these results suggest that the increase in the number of activated neurons is functionally beneficial, resulting in improved discrimination of changes in the electrical signals.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "83", "title": "Surgical options in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7675175", "authors": ["Arle, JE", "Alterman, RL"], "year": "1999", "journal": "The Medical clinics of North America", "abstract": "With the resurgence of interest in neurosurgical intervention for the treatment of drug-resistant Parkinson's disease, posteroventral pallidotomy (internal globus pallidus) has become a procedure widely applied by neurosurgeons.

This tolerance seems to have a pharmacodynamic basis, since downregulation of cannabinoid receptors in motor areas, basal ganglia and cerebellum, has been demonstrated in cannabinoid-tolerant rats. The present study was designed to further explore this previous evidence by analyzing simultaneously in several motor areas of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol- (delta 9-THC)-tolerant rats: 1. Cannabinoid receptor binding, by using [3H]WIN-55,212-2 autoradiography; 2. Cannabinoid receptor activation of signal transduction mechanisms, by using WIN-55,212-2-stimulated [35S]-guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate ([35S]-GTP gamma S) autoradiography; 3. Cannabinoid receptor mRNA expression, quantitated by in situ hybridization. Results were as follows. As expected, the exposure to delta 9-THC for 5 d resulted in a decrease of cannabinoid receptor binding in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, medial, and lateral caudate-putamen and, in particular, entopeduncular nucleus. We also found decreased cannabinoid receptor binding in the superficial and deep layers of the cerebral cortex, two regions used as a reference to test the specificity of changes observed in motor areas. There were only two brain regions, the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra, where the specific binding for cannabinoid receptors was unaltered after 5 d of a daily delta 9-THC administration. However, in the substantia nigra, the magnitude of WIN-55,212-2-stimulated [35S]-GTP gamma S binding was lesser in delta 9-THC-tolerant rats than controls, thus suggesting a possible specific change at the level of receptor coupling to GTP-binding proteins. This was not seen neither in the globus pallidus nor in the lateral caudate-putamen, where agonist stimulation produced similar [35S]-GTP gamma S binding levels in delta 9-THC-tolerant rats and controls. Finally, animals chronically exposed to delta 9-THC also exhibited a decrease in the levels of cannabinoid receptor mRNA in the medial and lateral caudate-putamen, but there were no changes in the cerebellum (granular layer) and cerebral cortex. In summary, the chronic exposure to delta 9-THC resulted in a decrease in cannabinoid receptor binding and mRNA levels in the caudate-putamen, where cell bodies of cannabinoid receptor-containing neurons in the basal ganglia are located. However, this decrease particularly affected the receptor binding levels in those neurons projecting to the entopeduncular nucleus, but not in those projecting to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, although, in this last region, a specific decrease in the efficiency of receptor activation of signal transduction mechanisms was seen in delta 9-THC-tolerant rats.

The aim of this study was to establish the safety of performing fMR imaging in patients with thalamic deep brain stimulators and to determine the value of fMR imaging in detecting cortical and subcortical activity during stimulation. Functional MR imaging was performed in three patients suffering from chronic pain and two patients with essential tremor. Two of the three patients with pain had undergone electrode implantation in the thalamic sensory ventralis caudalis (Vc) nucleus and the other had undergone electrode implantation in both the Vc and the periventricular gray (PVG) matter. Patients with tremor underwent electrode implantation in the ventralis intermedius (Vim) nucleus. Functional MR imaging was performed during stimulation by using a pulse generator connected to a transcutaneous extension lead. Clinically, Vc stimulation evoked paresthesias in the contralateral body, PVG stimulation evoked a sensation of diffuse internal body warmth, and Vim stimulation caused tremor arrest. Functional images were acquired using a 1.5-tesla MR imaging system. The Vc stimulation at intensities provoking paresthesias resulted in activation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Stimulation at subthreshold intensities failed to activate the SI. Additional stimulation-coupled activation was observed in the thalamus, the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and the insula. In contrast, stimulation of the PVG electrode did not evoke paresthesias or activate the SI, but resulted in medial thalamic and cingulate cortex activation. Stimulation in the Vim resulted in thalamic, basal ganglia, and SI activation. An evaluation of the safety of the procedure indicated that significant current could be induced within the electrode if a faulty connecting cable (defective insulation) came in contact with the patient. Simple precautions, such as inspection of wires for fraying and prevention of their contact with the patient, enabled the procedure to be conducted safely. Clinical safety was further corroborated by performing 86 MR studies in patients in whom electrodes had been implanted with no adverse clinical effects. This is the first report of the use of fMR imaging during stimulation with implanted thalamic electrodes. The authors' findings demonstrate that fMR imaging can safely detect the activation of cortical and subcortical neuronal pathways during stimulation and that stimulation does not interfere with imaging.

An abrupt onset of acoustically-evoked firing at approximately 80-90 dB was observed in DLSC neurons of GEPR-9s, which was significantly above the normal threshold. DLSC neurons began to exhibit rapid tonic burst firing 1-2 s prior to the onset of the wild running behavior at the beginning of AGS.

Of 256 neurons, 102 produced accelerating discharges in response to depolarizing current pulses, whereas the other neurons showed spike frequency adaptation. Two mechanisms mediated the firing acceleration: a slow inactivation of a K+ current expressed upon activation of the neuron from hyperpolarized holding potentials, and the expression of a regenerative plateau potential activating around resting membrane potential. The increase in firing frequency was much stronger when sustained by the plateau potential (71 DHNs, 28%). A few neurons produced adaptation and both types of acceleration, in different membrane potential domains, showing that the firing pattern of a deep DHN is not a rigid characteristic. Plateau potentials could be elicited by stimulation of nociceptive primary afferent fibres. The bistability associated with plateau potentials permitted afterdischarges. Because plateau potentials had slow activation kinetics and were voltage-dependent, the neurons had non-linear input-output relationships in both the amplitude and time domains. Nociceptive primary afferent stimulation elicited intense and prolonged responses in plateau-generating DHNs, while brief bursts of spikes were evoked otherwise.

J. Neurophysiol. 80: 3148-3162, 1998. Functional relations between specialized parts of the brain may be important determinants of learned behaviors. To study this, we examined the interrelations of the auditory system with several extraauditory structures in two groups of rats having different behavioral histories. Both groups were trained to associate a tone conditional stimulus (CS) with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US). For one group, a light presented with the tone predicted the absence of the US (group TL-). In the other group, the light was a neutral stimulus (group TL0). Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) incorporation was measured in the presence of the tone-light compound. Because the tone-light compound was physically identical for both groups, neural differences between groups reflected differences in the learned associative properties of the stimuli. Covariances of FDG uptake in the auditory system and extraauditory structures were examined using partial least squares. Three strong covariance or functional connectivity patterns were identified. The first pattern mainly reflected similarities between groups, with strong interrelations between the subcortical auditory system and the thalamocortical visual system, cerebellum, deep cerebellar nuclei, and midline thalamus. This pattern of interactions may represent part of a common circuit for relaying the associative value of the tone CS to the cerebellum and the midline thalamus. The external nucleus of the inferior colliculus and medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus were associated more strongly with this pattern for group TL-, which was interpreted as representing the change of the associative value of the tone by the light, mediated through extraauditory influences on these two regions. A second pattern involved midbrain auditory regions, superior colliculus, zona incerta, and subiculum and was stronger for group TL0. The relations between midbrain structures may represent the excitatory conditioned response (CR) evoked by the tone in this group. The final pattern was strongest in group TL- and involved interrelations of the thalamocortical auditory system with hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and hypothalamus. This pattern may represent the learned inhibition of the CR to the tone in the presence of the light. These findings are consistent with behavioral studies suggesting that at least two types of associations are formed during associative learning. One is the sensory relation of the stimuli and another is the relation between the CS and the affective components of the US.

Slices of polymer containing different drugs were implanted onto the SC of guinea pigs before the development of the SC azimuthal auditory space map, at approximately 20 days after birth (DAB). A further group of animals was exposed to aminophosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) at approximately 250 DAB. Azimuthal spatial tuning properties of deep layer multiunits of anesthetized guinea pigs were examined approximately 20 days after implantation of the Elvax polymer. Broadband noise bursts were presented to the animals under anechoic, free-field conditions. Neuronal responses were used to construct polar plots representative of the auditory spatial multiunit receptive fields (MURFs). Animals exposed to control polymer could develop a map of auditory space in the SC comparable with that seen in unimplanted normal animals. Exposure of the SC of young animals to AP5, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, or atropine, resulted in a reduction in the proportion of spatially tuned responses with an increase in the proportion of broadly tuned responses and a degradation in topographic order. Thus N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA glutamate receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors appear to play vital roles in the development of the SC auditory space map. A group of animals exposed to AP5 beginning at approximately 250 DAB produced results very similar to those obtained in the young group exposed to AP5. Thus NMDA glutamate receptors also seem to be involved in the maintenance of the SC representation of auditory space in the adult guinea pig. Exposure of the SC of young guinea pigs to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor blocking agents produced some but not total disruption of the spatial tuning of auditory MURFs. Receptive fields were large compared with controls, but a significant degree of topographical organization was maintained. GABA receptors may play a role in the development of fine tuning and sharpening of auditory spatial responses in the SC but not necessarily in the generation of topographical order of the these responses.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging localization of ictal onset to a dysplastic cleft with simultaneous sensorimotor mapping: intraoperative electrophysiological confirmation and postoperative follow-up: technical note.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "10320391", "authors": ["Schwartz, TH", "Resor, SR", "De La Paz, R", "Goodman, RR"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Experience with 366 CT-stereotactic operations in varying movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, torsion dystonia, torticollis, hemihyperkinesis) is presented.

Because a minority of patients experience decrements in language and memory (often mild and transient) after thalamotomy, chronic thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) might be a safer treatment given its reversibility and the modifiability of stimulation parameters. Two preliminary studies support the relative cognitive safety of unilateral DBS of the ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus, but it is unclear whether possibly subtle changes in language and memory represent effects of \"microthalamotomy\" or of stimulation per se. This report provides preliminary data concerning effects of left thalamic stimulation on information processing speed, semantic memory (verbal fluency and visual confrontation naming), and verbal episodic memory in a patient with PD. In addition to being evaluated before and 3 and 6 months after surgery, the patient was tested 18 months after surgery either on or off medications and with the stimulator turned either on or off (order counterbalanced across medication conditions). Test performance differences between the stimulation conditions were attenuated \"off\" as compared to \"on\" medication. Vim stimulation consistently, albeit subtly, improved semantic verbal fluency but interfered with immediate recall of word lists.

In PD patients, tremor was selectively suppressed for < or = 11 years. In ET patients, results were satisfactory, but in 35% of the cases deteriorated with time, when tremor had an action component. Other types of dyskinesias were much less influenced. Sixty-eight patients were bilaterally implanted, and 14 were implanted contralateral to a previous thalamotomy. Side effects were often minor, well tolerated, and immediately reversible. Three secondary scalp infections led to temporary removal of implanted material. There was no permanent morbidity. Long-term Vim stimulation, which is reversible, adaptable, and well tolerated, even by bilaterally operated-on (68 of 134) and by elderly patients, should replace thalamotomy in the regular surgical treatment of parkinsonian and essential tremors. More recently, we stimulated the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 51 patients (44 bilateral) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in 12 patients (seven bilateral). STN stimulation has a spectacular effect on akinesia and rigidity and may improve the patients so as to maintain them all day at a level similar to their best \"on\" periods. A 30-50% reduction in drug dosage was possible in most of the patients. GPi stimulation has indications and effects similar to those of pallidectomy: abnormal involuntary movements are totally suppressed, whereas effects on akinesia and rigidity are not so important as they are with STN stimulation. For all three targets, morbidity is low and reversible, even when bilateral implantations are performed. The deep-brain stimulation method has now proved its safety as compared with ablative surgery and is able to provide a significant improvement to these severely disabled patients.

Several clinical and experimental studies suggest that functional consequences of cortical dysplasias are not restricted to the area of the dysplastic lesion but also involve remote brain regions. In the present study cortical malformations were induced in newborn rats at day of birth by intracerebral injection of the glutamatergic agonist ibotenate. The resulting cytoarchitectonic lesion associates neuronal depopulation of deep cortical layers, ectopic neurons in superficial layers and sulcus formation, mimicking human polymicrogyria and migration disorders. Electrophysiological recordings of evoked field potentials in slice preparations of adult animals reveal hyperexcitability in widespread cortical regions surrounding the dysplasia. Low-intensity stimulation induced epileptiform activity consisting of long-lasting, multiphasic and N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent field responses. They appeared with high variability as all-or-none events. These widespread changes in excitability were not observed in sham-operated animals with small superficial ectopias but intact deep cortical layers, indicating that focal loss of these layers induces extended alterations in cortical connectivity and imbalance of excitation and inhibition. Restricted zones of increased excitability were also found in the forelimb and hindlimb representation cortex in sham-operated and control animals, demonstrating that this activity has to be considered as an intrinsic property of specific cortical areas. Deoxyglucose autoradiography showed that the widespread hyperexcitability in ibotenate-injected animals was not accompanied by alterations in glucose metabolism, although in the area of structural abnormality a typical metabolic pattern was found, revealing an increased glucose uptake in layer I. Hypometabolism as described for many types of human dysplastic lesions was not observed. This difference between the experimental and clinical data may be due to the absence of behavioral seizures in this model.

To investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of epileptiform activity, slices of piriform cortex were examined by imaging electrical activity with a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye. Discharge activity was studied for different sites of stimulation and different planes of slicing along the anterior-posterior axis. Epileptiform behavior was elicited either by disinhibition with a gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor antagonist or by induction with a transient period of spontaneous bursting in low-chloride medium. Control activity recorded with fluorescent dye had the same pharmacological and temporal characteristics as control activity reported previously with microelectrodes. Simultaneous optical and extracellular microelectrode recordings of epileptiform discharges showed the same duration, latency, and all-or-none character as described previously with microelectrodes. Under all conditions examined, threshold electrical stimulation applied throughout the piriform cortex evoked all-or-none epileptiform discharges originating in a site that included the endopiriform nucleus, a previously identified site of discharge onset. In induced slices, but not disinhibited slices, the site of onset also included layer VI of the adjoining agranular insular cortex and perirhinal cortex, in slices from anterior and posterior piriform cortex, respectively. These locations had not been identified previously as sites of discharge onset. Thus like the endopiriform nucleus, the deep agranular insular cortex and perirhinal cortex have a very low seizure threshold. Additional subtle differences were noted between the induced and disinhibited models of epileptogenesis. Velocity was determined for discharges after onset, as they propagated outward to the overlying piriform cortex. Propagation in other directions was examined as well. In most cases, velocities were below that for action potential conduction, suggesting that recurrent excitation and/or ephaptic interactions play a role in discharge propagation.

Intracellular recordings from 23 relay cells in LP showed that they responded to SC stimulation with a long-lasting (140.2 +/- 19.6 ms; mean +/- SD) inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), which sometimes was followed by a rebound burst of spikes. The same SC stimulation evoked a burst of spikes in extracellular recordings from 31 recurrent inhibitory interneurons in the LP-cortical pathway, which were located in the ventral part of the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus. The mean latency of the burst in reticular cells was 1.6 ms shorter than that of the IPSP in LP relay cells, suggesting that the IPSP in LP cells was mediated by these reticular cells. Intracellular recordings from nine reticular cells showed that the burst of spikes evoked by SC stimulation resulted from an excitatory postsynaptic potential that was always followed by a long-lasting (143.3 +/- 24.0 ms) IPSP. Stimulation of the contralateral predorsal bundle, the main output pathway of deep SC neurons, elicited similar responses in LP cells or reticular neurons with latencies longer than those from SC stimulation. The latency difference between the responses to predorsal bundle and SC stimulation is equal to the antidromic conduction time of predorsal bundle fibers, suggesting that the inhibition in LP originates from the activation of predorsal bundle-projecting neurons. The response characteristics of the inhibitory circuit of LP and of the lateral geniculate nucleus to SC stimulation are strikingly similar, implying that a similar circuit is used by predorsal bundle-projecting neurons to control the recurrent inhibition in both lateral geniculate nucleus and LP. Because the predorsal bundle-projecting neurons are believed to be involved in the initiation of saccadic eye movements, we suggest that the inhibitory circuits may play an important role in modulating ascending visual information during saccadic eye movements.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Surgical treatment options in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7872154", "authors": ["Koller, WC", "Wilkinson, S", "Pahwa, R", "Miyawaki, EK"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Neurosurgery clinics of North America", "abstract": "As more is learnt about the functional implications of basal ganglia connectivity, the role of the subthalamic nucleus as a target site for stereotactic procedures in the amelioration of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease is becoming clearer. A comparison of various neurosurgical procedures in the disease is discussed in relation to current thinking about circuitry. Experimental investigations involving lesioning or stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in nonhuman primate models and in clinical studies of Parkinson's disease are compared. Neurosurgical procedures that lesion structures bilaterally are more likely to induce side effects than is deep-brain stimulation, which has the added advantage of reversibility and which is more amenable to titration in relation to medication and dosage. A small but growing number of parkinsonian patients have received subthalamic stimulation either unilaterally or bilaterally. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus ameliorates tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia, as opposed to thalamic stimulation which is probably best reserved for tremor-dominant patients. Such procedures also do not involve the same complex technical and ethical issues that are associated with foetal mesencephalic grafting. Although subthalamic stimulation shows great promise, it has not been developed to the point where it can be used as more than an experimental treatment. Further experimental research is required before the new strategies can be used on a larger scale.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "118", "title": "Functional evidence for the differential control of superficial and deep blood vessels by sympathetic vasoconstrictor and primary afferent vasodilator fibres in rat hairless skin.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7885558", "authors": ["H\u00e4bler, HJ", "Stegmann, JU", "Timmermann, L", "J\u00e4nig, W"], "year": "1998", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The purpose of this work was to find the location of the direct activation. The response to stimulation was modeled with a spherical head model and an active model of a corticospinal nerve. The nerve model had a deep bend at a location corresponding to a corticospinal fiber entering the midbrain. The threshold activation initiated close to brain surface; the exact location depended on whether the cell body located in the surface layers of the brain or in the bank of the central sulcus. The stimulation time constant was 44 micros. When the stimulus amplitude was increased, the site of activation shifted gradually to deeper level, until the activation initiated directly at the bend causing a half millisecond latency jump at spinal level. These results support the theory that the corticospinal axons can be directly activated at deep locations using anodal transcranial electrical stimulation. However, the high amplitude needed for the direct activation suggests that not only the bends on the fibers, but also the shape of surrounding volume conductor (intracranial cavity) favor activation at this location.", "pages": "847-50"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Diagnostic significance of MEP elicited by electrical and magnetoelectric stimulation in acute/subacute supratentorial lesions.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "7892372", "authors": ["Zentner, J", "Meyer, B"], "year": "", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "Although technically challenging to obtain, ictal functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used to localize ictal onset zones in a small number of patients.
