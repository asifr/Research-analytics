Our understanding of the pathophysiology of psychosis in PD has expanded dramatically over the past 15 years, from an initial interpretation of symptoms as dopaminergic drug adverse effects to the current view of a complex interplay of extrinsic and disease-related factors.PD psychosis has unique clinical features, namely that it arises within a context of a clear sensorium and retained insight, there is relative prominence of visual hallucinations and progression occurs over time. PD psychosis tends to emerge later in the disease course, and disease duration represents one risk factor for its development. The use of anti-PD medications (particularly dopamine receptor agonists) has been the most widely identified risk factor for PD psychosis. Other risk factors discussed in the literature include older age, disease severity, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, dementia and/or depression.Recent efforts have aimed to explore the complex pathophysiology of PD psychosis, which is now known to involve an interaction between extrinsic, drug-related and intrinsic, disease-related components. The most important extrinsic factor is use of dopaminergic medication, which plays a prominent role in PD psychosis. Intrinsic factors include visual processing deficits (e.g. lower visual acuity, colour and contrast recognition deficits, ocular pathology and functional brain abnormalities identified amongst hallucinating PD patients); sleep dysregulation (e.g. sleep fragmentation and altered dream phenomena); neurochemical (dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, etc.) and structural abnormalities involving site-specific Lewy body deposition; and genetics (e.g. apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele and tau H1H1 genotype). Preliminary reports have also shown a potential relationship between deep brain stimulation surgery and PD psychosis.When reduction in anti-PD medications to the lowest tolerated dose does not improve psychosis, further intervention may be warranted. Several atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e. clozapine, olanzapine) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing psychotic symptoms in PD; however, use of clozapine requires cumbersome monitoring and olanzapine leads to motor worsening. Studies of ziprasidone and aripiprazole are limited to open-label trials and case reports and are highly variable; however, it appears that while each may be effective in some patients, both are associated with adverse effects. While quetiapine has not been determined efficacious in two randomized controlled trials, it is a common first-line treatment for PD psychosis because of its tolerability, ease of use and demonstrated utility in numerous open-label reports. Cholinesterase inhibitors currently represent the most promising pharmacological alternative to antipsychotics. Tacrine is rarely tried because of hepatic toxicity, and controlled trials with donepezil have not shown significant reductions in psychotic symptoms, due perhaps to methodological limitations. However, results from an open-label study and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 188 hallucinating PD patients support the efficacy of rivastigmine. With regard to non-pharmacological interventions, case reports suggest that electroconvulsive therapy has the potential to reduce psychotic symptoms and may be considered in cases involving concurrent depression and/or medication-refractory psychosis. Limited case reports also suggest that specific antidepressants (i.e. clomipramine and citalopram) may improve psychosis in depressed patients. Finally, studies in the schizophrenia literature indicate that psychological approaches are effective in psychosis management but, to date, this strategy has been supported only qualitatively in PD, and further studies are warranted.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Results by motor cortex stimulation in treatment of focal dystonia, Parkinson's disease and post-ictal spasticity.

Three-dimensional movements were recorded with the ELITE system and three kinematic variables were considered: total movement time (TMT), total inter-onset latency (IOL), and spatial accuracy. Unilateral STN-DBS significantly decreased TMT in the contralateral arm and only tended to do so also in the ipsilateral arm, whereas it significantly decreased IOL and worsened spatial accuracy only on the contralateral side.

After unilateral STN-DBS the UPDRS scores improved in the contralateral and to a lesser extent also in the ipsilateral side. Correlation analysis between clinical and kinematic data showed no differences between the contralateral and ipsilateral sides. Our kinematic findings show that after STN-DBS parkinsonian patients' performance of a sequential motor task improves significantly on the contralateral but only tended to do so on the ipsilateral side.

We studied nine patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to test whether cortical stimulation can modulate synchronized oscillations in the human subthalamic nucleus. With patients at rest, single-pulse TMS was delivered every 5 s over each primary motor area and supplementary motor area at intensities of 85-115% resting motor threshold. Subthalamic local field potentials were recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted into this nucleus for the treatment of PD. Motor cortical stimulation suppressed beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus from approximately 0.2 to 0.6 s after TMS (repeated measures anova; main effect of time, P < 0.01; main effect of side, P = 0.03), regardless of intensity. TMS over the supplementary motor area also reduced subthalamic beta activity at 95% (P = 0.05) and 115% resting motor threshold (P = 0.01).

CH has a circannual and circadian periodicity, attacks being clustered (hence the name) in bouts that can occur during specific months of the year. Alcohol is the only dietary trigger of CH, strong odors (mainly solvents and cigarette smoke) and napping may also trigger CH attacks. During bouts, attacks may happen at precise hours, especially during the night. During the attacks, patients tend to be restless. CH may be episodic or chronic, depending on the presence of remission periods. CH is associated with trigeminovascular activation and neuroendocrine and vegetative disturbances, however, the precise cautive mechanisms remain unknown.

These operations can include the creation of lesions in the thalamus (thalamotomy) or the globus pallidus (pallidotomy), or the insertion of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the subcortical nuclei. These subcortical targets are often difficult to localize in pre-operative imaging data due to the limited resolution and contrast available in standard MRI or CT techniques. To address this problem, digital atlases of subcortical nuclei are often used to accurately identify surgical targets since they can be warped to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Targeting accuracy thus depends on the quality of the atlas-to-patient warp. In this paper, three atlas-to-patient warping techniques are compared. Two methods rely on an MRI template as an intermediary to estimate a nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation. The third is novel, and uses a pseudo-MRI derived from an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to estimate the nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation directly. The methods are compared using (1) manual segmentations of subcortical nuclei and (2) functional data from intra-operative thalamic stimulation. The results demonstrate that the template-based atlas-to-patient warping technique is the best of the three for customizing the atlas onto patient data.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "29 Suppl 1", "title": "Cluster headache: from treatment to pathophysiology.", "issue": "", "pmid": "15312276", "authors": ["Bussone, G"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "The effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation on cognition and mood have not been well established. The authors estimated cognitive and mood effects of bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Forty-six patients were recruited from the Movement Disorder Center at Seoul National University Hospital. Neuropsychologic tests were performed three times, before, 6 months after, and 1 year after surgery. Mean patient age was 58 and mean education duration 8 years. Eighteen of the 46 patients were men. The instruments used for assessing cognitive functions were; the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), the Trail Making Test (TMT), the Korean Boston Naming Test (K-BNT), the Rey-Kim Memory Battery, the Grooved pegboard test, the Stroop test, a fluency test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST), and the Beck depression inventory (BDI). Of these tests, the verbal memory test, the Stroop test, and the fluency test showed statistically significant changes. The verbal memory test using the Rey-Kim memory battery showed a decline in delayed recall and recognition at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively, whereas nonverbal memory showed no meaningful change. In terms of frontal lobe function tests, Stroop test and fluency test findings were found to be aggravated at 6 months and this continued at 1 year postoperatively. Previous studies have consistently reported a reduction in verbal fluency and improvements in self-reported symptoms of depression after STN DBS. However, in the present study, Beck depression inventory (B.D.I.) was not significantly changed. Other tests, namely, MMSE, TMT, K-BNT, Grooved pegboard test, and the WCST also failed to show significant changes. Of the baseline characteristics, age at onset, number of years in full-time education, and L-dopa equivalent dosage were found to be correlated with a postoperative decline in neuropsychological test results. The correlation of motor improvement and cognitive deterioration was not significant, which suggests that the stimulation effect is rather confined to the motor-related part in the STN. In conclusion, bilateral STN DBS in Parkinson's disease did not lead to a significant global deterioration in cognitive function.

We tested the hypothesis that PH stimulation could restore movement in animals made cataleptic by the D(2) receptor antagonist haloperidol. We further hypothesized that hippocampal-striatal neural synchrony may be important in the organization of motor behaviours. Animals chronically implanted with hippocampal and striatal recording electrodes and PH stimulating electrode were tested in open field, catalepsy and active avoidance paradigms. The degree of hippocampal-striatal theta (5-10 Hz) field coherence was assessed during baseline avoidance testing and following the administration of haloperidol. Haloperidol abolished movement in open field and active avoidance tasks and increased the latency to respond in the catalepsy test. Stimulation of the PH under haloperidol reversed catalepsy. Hippocampal-striatal theta coherence was high throughout the active avoidance task in control experiments but was greatly reduced under haloperidol. PH stimulation was able to reinstate the hippocampal-striatal theta coherence while restoring task-related behaviours. These results support the hypothesis that DBS of the PH could restore motor behaviours in rats made cataleptic with haloperidol, thus providing strong support for the PH as a promising candidate for DBS in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

It is controversial if and how the STN contributes to tremor generation. In this study, we analyze neuronal STN activity in seven patients with Parkinsonian rest tremor who underwent stereotactic surgery for deep brain stimulation. Surface EMG was recorded from the wrist flexors and extensors. Simultaneously, neuronal spike activity was registered in different depths of the STN using an array of five microelectrodes. After spike-sorting, spectral coherence was analyzed between spike activity of STN neurons and tremor activity. Significant coherence at the tremor frequency was detected between EMG and neuronal STN activity in 76 out of 145 neurons (52.4%). In contrast, coherence in the beta band occurred only in 10 out of 145 neurons (6.9%). Tremor-coherent STN activity was widely distributed over the STN being more frequent in its dorsal parts (70.8-88.9%) than in its ventral parts (25.0-48.0%). Our results suggest that synchronous neuronal STN activity at the tremor frequency contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinsonian tremor.

This method does not work in cases where tremor vanishes intraoperatively, for example, due to general anaesthesia or due to an insertional effect. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a stimulation technique that effectively evokes tremor in a well-defined and quantifiable manner. For this, we used patterned low-frequency stimulation (PLFS), i.e. brief high-frequency pulse trains administered at pulse rates similar to neurons' preferred burst frequency. Unlike periodic single-pulse stimulation, PLFS enables one to convey effective and considerably greater integral charge densities without violation of safety requirements. In a computational investigation of an oscillatory neuronal network temporarily rendered inactive, we found that PLFS evokes synchronized activity, phase locked to the stimulus. While a stronger increase in the amount of synchrony in the neuronal population requires higher stimulus intensities, the portion of synchronously active neurons nevertheless becomes strongly phase locked to PLFS already at weak stimulus intensities. The phase entrainment effect of PLFS turned out to be robust against variations in the stimulation frequency, whereas enhancement of synchrony required precisely tuned stimulation frequencies. We applied PLFS to a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) with pronounced tremor that disappeared intraoperatively under general anaesthesia. In accordance with our computational results, PLFS evoked tremor, phase locked to the stimulus. In particular, weak PLFS caused low-amplitude, but strongly phase-locked tremor.

Cluster headache (CH) is the most frequent trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC) and the most representative of this spectrum of disorders characterised by the association of headache and loco-regional signs and symptoms of facial parasympathetic activation. The striking features of circadian rhythmicity of attacks and circannual periodicity of cluster period, together with the neuroendocrine abnormalities, are suggestive of a neurochronobiological disorder with a central-diencephalic pathogenetic involvement, confirmed by direct evidence in functional neuroimaging studies of ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic activation during cluster attack.

Functional neuroimaging demonstrated that TACs are associated with activation of the posterior hypothalamus and there is clinical evidence that patients who suffer from CH have altered biological rhythms.

PD was simulated as a reduction in dopamine levels, and a loss of functional segregation between two competing motor modules. In order to compare model simulations with performed movements, flexion and extension at the elbow joint is taken as a test case. Results indicated that loss of segregation contributed to bradykinesia due to interference between competing modules and a reduced ability to suppress unwanted movements. Additionally, excessive neurotransmitter depletion is predicted as a possible mechanism for the increased difficulty in performing complex movements. The simulation results showed that the model is in qualitative agreement with the results from movement experiments on PD patients and healthy subjects. Furthermore, based on changes in the firing rate of BG nuclei, the model demonstrated that the effective mechanism of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in STN may result from stimulation induced inhibition of STN, partial synaptic failure of efferent projections, or excitation of inhibitory afferent axons even though the underlying methods of action may be quite different for the different mechanisms.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Bitemporal electroconvulsive therapy for depression in a Parkinson disease patient with a deep-brain stimulator.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9251085", "authors": ["Bailine, S", "Kremen, N", "Kohen, I", "Linder, H", "Schwartz, GJ", "Mogilner, AY", "Pourfar, M"], "year": "2008", "journal": "The journal of ECT", "abstract": "Tremor is one of the most frequent neurological signs; the diagnosis is mainly clinical.

The exact methods of action are not well understood, but an high motivation of the patients to stay abstinent seems to be of relevance for the effect of NAc DBS.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "Subthalamic stimulation for essential tremor.

Using the BpLSI, we observed a process of stimulation-dependent modulation at synapse with multi-site (16 x 19 pixel) in widespread area and a high-speed video rate, and found that the gradual up-regulated proteolytic activity in a wide range of hippocampal CA1 area and the steep activity in local area, indicating that the proteolysis system is a basis for the fixation of long-term potentiation in post-excited synapses in the hippocampus.

The anesthetized rat is a useful model for investigating the effects of dopamine loss on the transmission of oscillatory cortical activity through basal ganglia structures. After dopamine loss, synchronous oscillatory activity emerges in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata in phase with cortical slow oscillations. To investigate the impact of dopamine cell lesion-induced changes in basal ganglia output on activity in the PPN, this study examines PPN spike timing with reference to motor cortex (MCx) local field potential (LFP) activity in urethane- or ketamine-anesthetized rats. Seven to ten days after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the medial forebrain bundle, spectral power in PPN spike trains and coherence between PPN spiking and PPN LFP activity increased in the approximately 1 Hz range in urethane-anesthetized rats. PPN spike timing also changed from firing predominantly in phase with MCx slow oscillations in the intact urethane-anesthetized rat to firing predominantly antiphase to MCx oscillations in the hemi-parkinsonian rat. These changes were not observed in the ketamine-anesthetized preparation. These observations suggest that dopamine loss alters PPN spike timing by increasing inhibitory oscillatory input to the PPN from basal ganglia output nuclei, a phenomenon that may be relevant to motor dysfunction and PPN DBS efficacy in PD patients.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "[Deep brain stimulation and Parkinson's disease].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "15799011", "authors": ["Boisson, D"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Annales de r\u00e9adaptation et de m\u00e9decine physique : revue scientifique de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de r\u00e9\u00e9ducation fonctionnelle de r\u00e9adaptation et de m\u00e9decine physique", "abstract": "Manic symptoms have been reported as adverse effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease.

However, the temporal profile of such interaction has not been fully studied. In eight patients who had been implanted an intrathalamic electrode for deep brain stimulation as symptomatic treatment of tremor, we investigated the interactions between mechanical taps and electrical nerve stimuli. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from Erb's point, cervical spinal cord, nucleus ventrointermedialis of the thalamus, and parietal cortex. A handheld electronic reflex hammer was used to deliver a mechanical tap to the skin overlying the first dorsal interosseous muscle and to trigger an ipsilateral digital median nerve electrical stimulus time-locked to the mechanical tap with a variable delay of 0 to 50 ms. There were significant time-dependent interactions between the two sensory volleys at the subcortical level. Thalamic SEPs were decreased in amplitude at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) from 10 to 40 ms with maximum effect at 20 ms (-42.8 +/- 10.5%; P < 0.001). A similar decrease was also seen in the number and frequency of the high-frequency components of thalamic SEPs (-25 +/- 4%). A smaller reduction (-18.1 +/- 5.8%; P < 0.001) was present in upper cervical response at ISI = 20 ms. There were no changes in peripheral responses. Cortical SEPs were almost completely absent in some subjects at ISIs from 20 to 50 ms. There were no changes in SEP latencies. Our results indicate that significant time-dependent interactions between sensory volleys occur at the subcortical level. These observations provide further insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying afferent gating between sensory volleys of different modality.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Lessons from 8 years' experience of hypothalamic stimulation in cluster headache.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "15911796", "authors": ["Leone, M", "Proietti Cecchini, A", "Franzini, A", "Broggi, G", "Cortelli, P", "Montagna, P", "May, A", "Juergens, T", "Cordella, R", "Carella, F", "Bussone, G"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache", "abstract": "Although many questions are still debated, some recommendations can be formulated regarding the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in the ICU. A transient curarization can be used during brief diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in order to avoid haemodynamic consequences of deep sedation. A volume controlled ventilation has to be used during the procedure. In ARDS patients, a prolonged curarization of 48 h or more is beneficial regarding systemic oxygenation, even in patients well adapted to their ventilator. The use of cisatracurium should be recommended in this context. The depth of curarization has to be checked by using a train of four stimulation at the corugator supercilii with an endpoint of 2/4 responses. A recovery from curarization should be daily envisaged if possible, in order to check the depth of the underlying sedation. In brain injured patients, a curarization can be envisaged if adaptation to the ventilator remains difficult or if normothermia or moderate hypothermia, if indicated, cannot be obtained.

Why then does consciousness fade? According to the integrated information theory of consciousness, what is critical for consciousness is not firing rates, sensory input, or synchronization per se, but rather the ability of a system to integrate information. If consciousness is the capacity to integrate information, then the brain should be able to generate consciousness to the extent that it has a large repertoire of available states (information), yet it cannot be decomposed into a collection of causally independent subsystems (integration). A key prediction stemming from this hypothesis is that such ability should be greatly reduced in deep NREM sleep; the dreamless brain either breaks down into causally independent modules, shrinks its repertoire of possible responses, or both. In this article, we report the results of a series of experiments in which we employed a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and high-density electroencephalography (TMS/hd-EEG) to directly test this prediction in humans. Altogether, TMS/hdEEG measurements suggest that the sleeping brain, despite being active and reactive, loses its ability of entering states that are both integrated and differentiated; it either breaks down in causally independent modules, responding to TMS with a short and local activation, or it bursts into an explosive and aspecific response, producing a full-fledged slow wave.", "pages": "186-99"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Neuropsychological and psychiatric changes after deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a randomised, multicentre study.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "16062098", "authors": ["Witt, K", "Daniels, C", "Reiff, J", "Krack, P", "Volkmann, J", "Pinsker, MO", "Krause, M", "Tronnier, V", "Kloss, M", "Schnitzler, A", "Wojtecki, L", "B\u00f6tzel, K", "Danek, A", "Hilker, R", "Sturm, V", "Kupsch, A", "Karner, E", "Deuschl, G"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Since the initial 1991 report by Tsubokawa et al., stimulation of the M1 region of cortex has been used to treat chronic pain conditions and a variety of movement disorders.", "pages": "186-99"}]
