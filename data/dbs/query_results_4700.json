Following movement, a decrease in amplitude of beta rhythm ERS was observed over the same region and thought to be related to impairment in cortical deactivation. By monitoring ERD/ERS, we aimed (i) to extend to advanced PD the observations made in less-advanced parkinsonism and (ii) to test the effect of acute L-Dopa, internal pallidal or subthalamic stimulation on these abnormalities. For the clinical evaluation the motor score of UPDRS decreased by about 60% under subthalamic stimulation and following acute L-Dopa administration and by 40% under internal pallidal stimulation. The following concurrent ERD/ERS changes under subthalamic stimulation and L-Dopa were observed: a marked increase in mu ERD latency during movement preparation over contralateral central region; an increase in mu ERD during movement execution over bilateral central regions; a decrease in mu ERD latency over bilateral frontocentral region and an increase in beta ERS over contralateral central region after movement. On the contrary, mu ERD latency was not improved under internal pallidal stimulation. Changes of mu and beta rhythm parameters seemed to be inversely correlated with bradykinesia. Mu rhythm ERD latency and the beta ERS amplitude further decreased in advanced PD compared with early stages, suggesting greater impairment of cortical activation/deactivation as the disease progresses and a partial restoration in relation to clinical improvement under treatments. Consequently, it appears that L-Dopa and deep brain stimulation partially restored the normal patterns of cortical oscillatory activity in PD, possibly by decreasing the low frequency hyper synchronisation at rest.

It may also occur by relearning, a process that strengthens existing pathways and may lead to new functional or structural changes- neuroplasticity. Clinical investigation into the treatment of chronic pain after thalamic infarction has shown improvement in motor function when pain relief is achieved with motor cortex stimulation. More recently, laboratory studies in rats and primates demonstrate significant improvement in forelimb reaching tasks in rats and primates after induced ischemic cortical infarction when rehabilitation is paired with stimulation of the injured cortex and cortical margin at low frequency (50 Hz). Structural changes have also been observed. Dendritic density in layer V of the cortex near the lesion increases after cortical stimulation, consistent with a restorative cortical plasticity. Also, stimulation combined with rehabilitation increases the area of the injured cortex from which movements can be evoked in response to stimulation of the injured cortex in rats. Unilateral cortical stimulation reduces secondary cortical hyperexcitability in the impaired hemisphere after stroke. These findings form the basis for the first clinical study motor cortex stimulation after chronic stroke in humans. A prospective, randomized multicenter study of subthreshold motor cortical electrical stimulation during rehabilitation in patients has been completed. The eight patients entered into this study had weakness from a stroke that occurred at least four months before enrollment. Results demonstrate that the treatment is safe. In addition, there was significant improvement in upper extremity function. These improvements persisted through the 12-week follow-up assessment period after completion of stimulation and rehabilitation. Recently, non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex demonstrates improvements in hand function that persist after stimulation for at least 25 minutes.

The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are still unknown. Several studies did demonstrate that, although motor cortex hyperexcitability appears to be responsible for abnormal co-contraction and overflow to adjacent muscles, plasticity mechanisms and integrative sensorimotor processing are also likely to be involved in this condition. Current dystonia treatments are based on oral medication, injection of botulinum toxin and, in a low proportion of cases, bi-pallidal deep brain stimulation. However, treatment outcome is generally disappointing. A few researchers have reported the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex or the premotor cortex, with the goal of decreasing motor cortex hyperexcitability. This article reviews all studies using this technique in dystonia and discusses rTMS therapeutic impact and its possible mechanisms of action in this indication. Currently, the premotor cortex seems to be the best target for rTMS in dystonia. Rather than merely reducing the hyperexcitability of the primary motor cortex, this technique's clinical benefit seems to result from modifications in plasticity and restoration of sensorimotor integration. The corollary technique for chronic rTMS is electrical cortical stimulation. Even though this new therapeutic tool may have therapeutic promise, more studies are required to confirm it. In particular, we need to broaden our knowledge of rTMS impact on the various forms of dystonia and to optimize target localization.", "pages": "1236-42"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Synchronizing activity of basal ganglia and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "70", "pmid": "15007213", "authors": ["Wichmann, T", "Delong, MR"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission.

Significant clinical effects have been obtained in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by stimulating different cortical regions with rTMS at inhibitory (low) or excitatory (high) frequency. These effects were thought to result from plastic changes in motor cortical networks. Actually cortical dysfunction has been documented in PD by neuroimaging and neurophysiologic studies showing either hypo- or hyper-activation of various brain areas. In addition, cortical excitability studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation disclosed significant alterations in intracortical facilitatory or inhibitory processes according to the resting state or to phases of movement preparation or execution. These observations clearly support the therapeutic potential of cortical neuromodulation in PD. Motor cortex stimulation could impact on any station within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops that are involved in motor control, providing alleviation of parkinsonian symptoms. Depending on the target, cortical stimulation might improve motor performance or other symptoms associated with PD, like depression. Clinical application of rTMS to treat PD patients is limited by the short duration of the effects beyond the time of stimulation, even if long-lasting improvements have been observed after repeated rTMS sessions. In any case, the place of cortical stimulation in the therapeutic management of PD patients remains to be determined, as an alternative or a complementary technique to deep brain stimulation.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is related to the release of substantial amounts of endogenous dopamine in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. As the ventral striatum is involved in reward processing, these observations suggest that the placebo effect may be linked to reward mechanisms. In keeping with this placebo-reward model, most recent experiments have shown activation of the reward circuitry in association with placebo responses in other disorders.

Therefore, we investigated the role of a newly identified SRF coactivator, MKL1, in the regulation of SRF-driven transcription in rat forebrain neurons. MKL1 expression was found in newborn rat cortical or hippocampal neurons in culture as well as in adult rat forebrain. Immunostaining demonstrated constitutive nuclear localization of MKL1 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, in the deep layers of the neocortex, and in cultured neurons. Overexpression of MKL1 in primary cortical neurons elevated SRF-driven transcription and enhanced its stimulation by BDNF. In addition, inhibition of endogenous MKL1 by overexpression of a dominant-negative MKL1 mutant or by small interfering RNA reduced BDNF activation of SRF-driven transcription. In neurons, endogenous MKL1 was associated with SRF-regulated chromatin regions of several endogenous genes including c-fos, JunB, Srf, and Cyr61. BDNF activation of MKL1/SRF-driven transcription was dependent on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, which also led to MKL1 phosphorylation. Finally, synaptic activity stimulation of SRF-driven transcription was reduced by inhibition of endogenous MKL1. Conversely, synaptic activity enhanced transcription by overexpressed MKL1. MKL1 regulation by synaptic activity was mediated through the NMDA receptor-activated ERK1/2. These results suggest that neuronal MKL1 contributes to SRF-regulated gene expression induced by BDNF or synaptic activity. In addition, MKL1 appears as a novel mediator of the signaling between ERK1/2 and SRF. Moreover, MKL1 is a likely regulator of SRF-driven transcription programs that underlie neuronal plasticity.", "pages": "1236-42"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Stimulation of subthalamic nucleus inhibits emotional activation of fusiform gyrus.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11488397", "authors": ["Coenen, VA", "Fromm, C", "Kronenb\u00fcrger, M", "Rohde, I", "Reinacher, PC", "Becker, R", "Marks, B", "Gilsbach, JM", "Rohde, V"], "year": "2006", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that beta (15-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is dramatically increased in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may interfere with movement execution. Dopaminergic medications decrease beta activity and deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the STN may alleviate PD symptoms by disrupting this oscillatory activity. Depth recordings from PD patients have demonstrated beta oscillatory neuronal and local field potential (LFP) activity in STN, although its prevalence and relationship to neuronal activity are unclear. In this study, we recorded both LFP and neuronal spike activity from the STN in 14 PD patients during functional neurosurgery. Of 200 single- and multiunit recordings 56 showed significant oscillatory activity at about 26 Hz and 89% of these were coherent with the simultaneously recorded LFP. The incidence of neuronal beta oscillatory activity was significantly higher in the dorsal STN (P = 0.01) and corresponds to the significantly increased LFP beta power recorded in the same region. Of particular interest was a significant positive correlation between the incidence of oscillatory neurons and the patient's benefit from dopaminergic medications, but not with baseline motor deficits off medication. These findings suggest that the degree of neuronal beta oscillatory activity is related to the magnitude of the response of the basal ganglia to dopaminergic agents rather than directly to the motor symptoms of PD. The study also suggests that LFP beta oscillatory activity is generated largely within the dorsal portion of the STN and can produce synchronous oscillatory activity of the local neuronal population.", "pages": "1236-42"}, {"volume": "67", "title": "Electrophysiological proof of diffusion-weighted imaging-derived depiction of the deep-seated pyramidal tract in human.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "11604609", "authors": ["Colloca, L", "Benedetti, F", "Bergamasco, B", "Vighetti, S", "Zibetti, M", "Ducati, A", "Lanotte, M", "Lopiano, L"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Neurochirurgie", "abstract": "We describe intermittent or sustained severe involuntary tongue protrusion in patients with a dystonic syndrome.

In the trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, neuroimaging findings support the hypothesis that activation of posterior hypothalamic neurons have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology and prompted the idea that hypothalamic stimulation might inhibit this activation to improve or eliminate the pain in intractable chronic cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic cephalgias. Over the past 6 years, hypothalamic implants have been used in various centres in patients with intractable chronic cluster headache. The results are encouraging: most patients achieved stable and notable pain reduction and many became pain free. All deep-brain-electrode implantation procedures carry a small risk of mortality due to intracerebral haemorrhage. Before implantation, all patients must undergo complete preoperative neuroimaging to exclude disorders associated with increased haemorrhagic risk. No substantial changes in hypothalamus-controlled functions have been reported during hypothalamic stimulation.

The mechanisms by which DBS alleviates tremor or causes side effects are unclear; thus, it is difficult to select stimulus parameters that maximize the width of the therapeutic window. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact on side effect intensity (SE), tremor amplitude, and the therapeutic window of varying stimulus parameters. Tremor amplitude and SE were recorded at 40 to 90 combinations of pulse width, frequency, and voltage across 14 thalami. Posterior variable inclusion probabilities indicated that frequency and voltage were the most important predictors of both SE and tremor amplitude. The amount of tremor suppression achieved at frequencies of 90 to 100 Hz was not different from that at 160 to 170 Hz. However, the width of the therapeutic window decreased significantly and power consumption increased as frequency was increased above 90 to 100 Hz.
