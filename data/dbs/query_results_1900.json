Drug treatment, although capable of controlling these symptoms over a number of years, becomes less effective as the disease progresses and leads to motor complications such as drug-induced dyskinesia (involuntary abnormal movements). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an alternative means of controlling motor symptoms in these patients, and while DBS has been effective in improving motor symptoms, these improvements are largely based on accurate placement of the lead and the ability of medical personnel to adequately program the DBS device following implantation. While guidelines exist for DBS programming, selection of stimulation parameters and patient outcome is greatly dependent on subjective clinical assessments and the experience of the medical personnel performing the programming. The aim of this project was to assess the feasibility of using a quantitative and objective approach to programming. Two subjects underwent standard procedures for DBS programming while wearing a small, compact motion sensor. Kinematic data were collected from subjects as they completed motor tasks to evaluate DBS efficacy. Quantitative variables characterizing tremor and bradykinesia were related to stimulation parameters. Results indicated different stimulation settings might be required for optimal improvement of different motor symptoms. A standardized method of programming DBS parameters utilizing motion analysis may provide an objective method of assessment that the programmer can use to better identify stimulation parameters to achieve optimal improvement across multiple motor symptoms.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Multi-site stimulation of subthalamic nucleus diminishes thalamocortical relay errors in a biophysical network model.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "10648446", "authors": ["Guo, Y", "Rubin, JE"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "abstract": "This paper presents results on a computational study of how multi-site stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), within the basal ganglia, can improve the fidelity of thalamocortical (TC) relay in a parkinsonian network model. In the absence of stimulation, the network model generates activity featuring synchronized bursting by clusters of neurons in the STN and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), as occurs experimentally in parkinsonian states. This activity yields rhythmic inhibition from GPi to TC neurons, which compromises TC relay of excitatory inputs. We incorporate two types of multi-site STN stimulation into the network model. One stimulation paradigm features coordinated reset pulses that are on for different subintervals of each period at different sites. The other is based on a filtered version of the local field potential recorded from the STN population. Our computational results show that both types of stimulation significantly diminish TC relay errors; the former reduces the rhythmicity of the net GPi input to TC neurons and the latter reduces, but does not eliminate, STN activity.

Bifurcation analysis of the single PPN cell shows bistability of fast and slow spiking solutions for a range of applied currents. A network model for STN, GPe and GPi produces basal ganglia output that is used as input for the PPN cell. The conductances for projections from the STN and the GPi to the PPN are determined from experimental data. The resulting behavior of the PPN cell is studied under normal and Parkinsonian conditions of the basal ganglia network. The effect of high frequency stimulation of the STN is considered as well as the effect of combined high frequency stimulation of the STN and the PPN at various frequencies. The relay properties of the PPN cell demonstrate that the combined high frequency stimulation of STN and low frequency (10 Hz, 25 Hz, 40 Hz) stimulation of PPN hardly improves the effect of exclusive STN stimulation. Moreover, PPN-DBS at low stimulation amplitude has a better effect than at higher stimulation amplitude. The effect of PPN output on the basal ganglia is investigated, in particular the effect of STN-DBS and/or PPN-DBS on the pathological firing pattern of STN and GPe cells.

For more than 2 decades, psychiatrists using neuroimaging have aspired to provide one form of \"laboratory study\" that Robins and Guze said would have to be in place for a psychiatric diagnosis to be valid: researchers have sought \"neural signatures\" of psychiatric disorders. Our objective was to examine the feasibility of this endeavor. To this end, we examine whether current psychiatric nosology as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) lends itself to the identification of neural signatures for psychiatric diagnoses. Because neuroimaging largely is used only to detect average activation or structural differences between groups of individuals with the same diagnosis and groups of individuals with no diagnosis, it is unlikely that it will be possible to use neuroimaging technologies to determine which psychiatric diagnosis a given individual warrants. In addition, the heterogeneity of psychiatric disorder categories as defined in the DSM reveals that these diagnoses do not reflect neurologically discrete phenomena. Finally, neural correlates of psychopathology generally are not unique to specific diagnoses.

With DBS, patients who in the past would have been restricted to a life of severe motor disability from a young age can now lead lives with only minimal symptoms. Although DBS should therefore be considered as a treatment option for any patient with severe, medically refractory dystonia, important questions remain about patient selection, including what factors predict which patients will benefit from DBS, and when in the course of disease DBS should be performed. Reports show that patients with primary dystonia respond better than those with secondary dystonia, and limb and axial muscles may improve more than cranial dystonia. Some studies also suggest that shorter duration of disease may be associated with better outcomes. However, it is important to note that even among those thought to respond best to DBS, i.e. patients with primary generalized dystonia, there is a subset that will have significant and sustained clinical benefit with oral medications. It is therefore important that adequate trials of oral medications be attempted prior to referral for surgery. On the other hand, once it is clear that medical therapies are not providing significant benefit or are not well tolerated, children with disabling generalized primary dystonia should be referred quickly for DBS. The dramatic clinical improvement that can be seen with DBS can restore normal or near-normal functioning and avoid the physical and emotional costs of an extended period of decreased physical and social functioning. In general, a levodopa trial should always be considered as the first treatment at the time of presentation of any patient with childhood-onset limb dystonia, in order to exclude dopa-responsive dystonia. Once a diagnosis of primary generalized dystonia is established, we typically initiate treatment with trihexyphenidyl, titrating slowly up to a high dose. We then frequently add baclofen as a second agent. If clinical improvement at that point is inadequate and the dystonia is causing significant functional impairment, we then consider referral for DBS.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Neuronal mechanisms and attentional modulation of corticothalamic \u03b1 oscillations.", "issue": "13", "pmid": "12039416", "authors": ["Bollimunta, A", "Mo, J", "Schroeder, CE", "Ding, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Field potential oscillations in the \u223c10 Hz range are known as the alpha rhythm.

How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG.

Moreover, these methods have proven useful and provided hope in the therapy of other diseases, most of all in psychiatry. From a historic perspective, this new emphasis on somatic therapies in the case of transcranial magnetic stimulation and cranial electrotherapy stimulation represents the return of therapeutic methods widely used in the 19th century and based on very similar techniques. Against the background of a general rise in the importance of neurobiological concepts in the neurosciences, we are now in a new situation of change. Yet, as in the 1880s and 1990s, many epistemic questions remain unresolved, the methods not yet having been standardized. In particular, the inability to explain which way and precisely how electricity induces healing processes in the body continues to put the neurosciences, which have always regarded themselves as exact and scientific in nature, in a rather uncomfortable position. There was a similar situation in the 1880s and 1990s, when positivist scientific dogmas prevailed. For ideological and professional reasons, neurologists strongly rejected the notion pioneered by Leipzig neuropsychiatrist Paul Julius M\u00f6bius that curative effects of electrotherapy were based on suggestion. One should see, however, that M\u00f6bius's actual concern was not to raise opposition towards or question electrotherapy as such, but rather to sensitize his colleagues in view of the prevailing solely materialistic-somatic approach in order that they should not neglect the psychological component of all illness, both in clinical practice and in research. A singular and very special event illustrates the heated debate among German-speaking neurologists on the psychological/suggestive effects of electrotherapy in the last decade of the 19th century-namely the 'Frankfurt Council' of 1891. The statements made at the Frankfurt convention of 35 leading electrotherapists in opposition to M\u00f6bius's criticism very much resemble present-day arguments and attitudes.

Firstly, DBS allows a decrease in dopaminergic medication and hence causes an improvement in ICDs. Secondly, some studies have proposed that specific ICDs may develop after DBS. This paper addresses the effects of DBS on ICDs in patients with PD. A literature search identified four original studies examining a total of 182 patients for ICDs and nine case reports of 39 patients that underwent DBS and developed ICDs at some point. Data analysis from the original studies did not identify a significant difference in ICDs between patients receiving dopaminergic medication and patients on DBS, whilst the case reports showed that 56% of patients undergoing DBS had poor outcome with regards to ICDs.

Since its inception, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) treatment has had varied clinical outcomes. Until this point, there has not been a systematic study of the stimulation parameters that most effectively treat chronic pain, or of the mechanisms by which MCS relieves pain. Here, using a rodent model of central pain, we perform a systematic study of stimulation parameters used for MCS and investigate the mechanisms by which MCS reduces hyperalgesia. Specifically, we study the role of the inhibitory nucleus zona incerta (ZI) in mediating the analgesic effects of MCS. In animals with mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, we find that stimulation at 50 \u03bcA, 50 Hz, and 300 \u03bcs square pulses for 30 minutes is sufficient to reverse mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia.

These findings suggest that the reduction of hyperalgesia may be due to MCS effects on ZI.

NIRS is proving its empirical utility across specific cognitive and emotional paradigms. However, a potential limitation is that it is not only sensitive to haemodynamic changes taking place in the cortex, and task-related cardiovascular responses expressed in the perfusion of extracranial layers may be confounding. Existing literature reports correlations between brain NIRS and systemic blood pressure, yet it falls short of establishing whether in normal participants the blood pressure changes encountered in experimental settings can have confounding effects. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing two experimental manipulations while recording from superficial occipital cortex, encompassing striate and extrastriate regions. Visual stimulation with reversing chequerboards evoked cortical haemodynamic responses. Simultaneously and independently, transient systemic blood pressure changes were generated through rapid arm-raising. Shallow-penetration NIRS recordings, probing only extra-cerebral tissues, highlighted close haemodynamic coupling with blood pressure. A different coupling pattern was observed in deep-penetration recordings directed at haemodynamic signals from visual cortex. In absence of blood-pressure changes, NIRS signals tracked differences in visual stimulus duration. However when blood pressure was actively manipulated, this effect was absent and replaced by a very large pressure-related response. Our observations demonstrate that blood pressure fluctuations can exert confounding effects on brain NIRS, through expression in extracranial tissues and within the brain itself. We highlight the necessity for continuous blood pressure monitoring alongside brain NIRS, and for further research on methods to correct for physiological confounds.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Individual fascicles of the paraspinal muscles are activated by discrete cortical networks in humans.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "3880898", "authors": ["Tsao, H", "Danneels, L", "Hodges, PW"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for the motor manifestations of advanced medically refractory Parkinson disease.

Recordings of local field potentials from subthalamic nucleus of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation have focused on oscillations occurring at frequencies below 100 Hz in the alpha, beta and gamma range and suggested that, in particular, an increase of beta band oscillations underlies slowing of movement in Parkinson's disease. Recent findings showing that the amplitude of high frequency oscillations (>200 Hz) couples with the phase of beta activity have raised the important question about the role of subthalamic high frequency oscillations in Parkinson's disease. To investigate functional characteristics and clinical relevance of high frequency oscillations, we recorded local field potentials from 18 subthalamic nuclei of 9 akinetic-rigid Parkinsonian patients with implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes and still externalised leads before and after intake of levodopa. We identified two distinct bands of high frequency oscillations, one centred around 250 Hz and another one around 350 Hz that show characteristic levodopa dependent amplitude and coupling behaviours. Administration of levodopa changed the power ratio between the two high frequency bands towards the component centred around 350 Hz in all 18 nuclei under study (p<10(-4)). Moreover, this power ratio correlated significantly with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale hemibody akinesia/rigidity subscore (r=0.3618, p=0.015), but interestingly not with beta peak power (p=0.1) suggesting that levodopa induced changes in high frequency and beta oscillations are at least potentially independent of each other. Accordingly, a combined parameter composed of power ratio of high frequency oscillations and beta peak power significantly increased the correlation with the motor state (r=0.45, p=0.004).

It provides further evidence of efficacy and safety, sham versus active stimulation evidence that this efficacy is real, and several key observations on how DBS interacts with the brain that can shed light on the neuropathophysiology of OCD itself.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "89", "title": "The contemporary practice of psychiatric surgery: results from a survey of North American functional neurosurgeons.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "21447901", "authors": ["Lipsman, N", "Mendelsohn, D", "Taira, T", "Bernstein, M"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) improves cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) and reduces antiparkinsonian medication.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which modulation of symmetry and coordination between legs by subthalamic deep brain stimulation alters the frequency and duration of freezing of gait in patients with Parkinson's disease. We recruited 13 post-subthalamic deep brain stimulation patients with Parkinson's disease with off freezing of gait and evaluated them in the following 4 conditions: subthalamic deep brain stimulation on (ON) and stimulation off (OFF), 50% reduction of stimulation voltage for the leg with shorter step length (worse side reduction) and for the leg with longer step length (better side reduction). Gait analysis was performed on a treadmill and recorded by an optoelectronic analysis system. We measured frequency and duration of freezing of gait episodes. Bilateral coordination of gait was assessed by the Phase Coordination Index, quantifying the ability to generate antiphase stepping. From the OFF to the ON state, freezing of gait improved in frequency (2.0 \u00b1 0.4 to 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 episodes) and duration (12.2 \u00b1 2.6 to 2.6 \u00b1 0.8 seconds; P = .005). Compared with the ON state, only better side reduction further reduced freezing of gait frequency (0.2 \u00b1 0.2) and duration of episodes (0.2 \u00b1 0.2 seconds; P = .03); worse side reduction did not change frequency (1.3 \u00b1 0.4) but increased freezing of gait duration (5.2 \u00b1 2.1 seconds). The better side reduction-associated improvements were accompanied by normalization of gait coordination, as measured by phase coordination index (16.5% \u00b1 6.0%), which was significantly lower than in the other 3 conditions. Reduction of stimulation voltage in the side contralateral to the leg with longer step length improves frequency and duration of freezing of gait through normalization of gait symmetry and coordination in subthalamic deep brain stimulation patients with Parkinson's disease. This identifies poor leg coordination as a risk factor for causing freezing of gait.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "The emerging use of technology for the treatment of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "21441639", "authors": ["Howland, RH", "Shutt, LS", "Berman, SR", "Spotts, CR", "Denko, T"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists", "abstract": "During the 1930s, white matter tracts began to assume relevance for neurosurgery, especially after Cajal's work. In many reviews of white matter neurobiology, the seminal contributions of Josef Klingler (1888-1963) and their neurological applications have been overlooked. In 1934 at the University of Basel under Eugen Ludwig, Klingler developed a new method of dissection based on a freezing technique for brain tissue that eloquently revealed the white matter tracts. Klingler worked with anatomists, surgeons, and other scientists, and his models and dissections of white matter tracts remain arguably the most elegant ever created. He stressed 3-dimensional anatomic relationships and laid the foundation for defining mesial temporal, limbic, insular, and thalamic fiber and functional relationships and contributed to the potential of stereotactic neurosurgery. Around 1947, Klingler was part of a Swiss-German group that independently performed the first stereotactic thalamotomies, basing their targeting and logic on Klingler's white matter studies, describing various applications of stereotaxy and showing Klingler's work integrated into a craniocerebral topographic system for targeting with external localization of eloquent brain structures and stimulation of deep thalamic nuclei. Klingler's work has received renewed interest because it is applicable for correlating the results of the fiber-mapping paradigms from diffusion tensor imaging to actual anatomic evidence. Although others have described white matter tracts, none have had as much practical impact on neuroscience as Klinger's work. More importantly, Josef Klingler was an encouraging mentor, influencing neurosurgeons, neuroscientists, and brain imaging for more than three quarters of a century.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "A microprobe for parallel optical and electrical recordings from single neurons in vivo.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "21441638", "authors": ["LeChasseur, Y", "Dufour, S", "Lavertu, G", "Bories, C", "Desch\u00eanes, M", "Vall\u00e9e, R", "De Koninck, Y"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Nature methods", "abstract": "Parkinsonian patients, who have had a unilateral pallidotomy, may require bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), due to disease progression. The current model of the basal ganglia circuitry does not predict a direct effect of pallidotomy on the neuronal activity of the ipsilateral STN. To date, only three studies have investigated the effect of pallidotomy on overall activity of the STN or neuronal firing rate, but not on the spectral content of the neuronal oscillatory activity. Moreover, none of these studies attempted to differentiate the effects on the dorsal (sensory-motor) and ventral (associative-limbic) parts of the STN. We studied the effect of pallidotomy on spectral power in six frequency bands in the STN ipsilateral and contralateral to pallidotomy from seven patients and in 60 control nuclei of patients without prior functional neurosurgery, and investigated whether this effect is different on the dorsal and ventral STN. The data show that pallidotomy suppresses beta power (13-30 Hz) in the ipsilateral STN. This effect tends predominantly to be present in the dorsal part of the STN. In addition, spectral power in the frequency range 3-30 Hz is significantly higher in the dorsal part than in the ventral part. The effect of pallidotomy on STN neural activity is difficult to explain with the current model of basal ganglia circuitry and should be envisaged in the context of complex modulatory interactions in the basal ganglia.", "pages": "1020-3"}, {"volume": "1385", "title": "Reading for sound with dyslexia: evidence for early orthographic and late phonological integration deficits.", "issue": "", "pmid": "21437651", "authors": ["Savill, NJ", "Thierry, G"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "In many patients, optimal results after pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) for primary dystonia may appear over several months, possibly beyond 1 year after implant. In order to elucidate the factors predicting such protracted clinical effect, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 44 patients with primary dystonia and bilateral pallidal DBS implants. Patients with fixed skeletal deformities, as well as those with a history of prior ablative procedures, were excluded. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) scores at baseline, 1 and 3 years after DBS were used to evaluate clinical outcome. All subjects showed a significant improvement after DBS implants (mean BFMDRS improvement of 74.9% at 1 year and 82.6% at 3 years). Disease duration (DD, median 15 years, range 2-42) and age at surgery (AS, median 31 years, range 10-59) showed a significant negative correlation with DBS outcome at 1 and 3 years.

Levodopa may improve the loss of motivation in the \"off\" motor state, and dopaminergic agonists could be useful to treat apathy after the withdrawal of dopaminergic treatment in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.
