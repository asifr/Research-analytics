This activity may be closely related to an oscillation between subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus. Since STN is the target of deep brain stimulation, it had been assumed that its action is on the nucleus itself. By means of simultaneous recordings of the firing activities from populations of neurons and the local field potentials in the motor cortex of freely moving Parkinsonian rats, this study casts doubt on this assumption. Instead, we found evidence that the corrective action is upon the cortex, where stochastic antidromic spikes originating from the STN directly modify the firing probability of the corticofugal projection neurons, destroy the dominance of beta rhythm, and thus restore motor control to the subjects, be they patients or rodents.", "pages": "1030-41"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Motor cortex stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23213520", "authors": ["De Rose, M", "Guzzi, G", "Bosco, D", "Romano, M", "Lavano, SM", "Plastino, M", "Volpentesta, G", "Marotta, R", "Lavano, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurology research international", "abstract": "Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS) is less efficacious than Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease.

There has been much debate over whether an etiological link between these two diseases exists and whether they share a common pathophysiology. Evidence pointing towards a link includes response to dopaminergic agents in PD and RLS, suggestive of underlying dopamine dysfunction in both conditions. The extrastriatal dopaminergic system, in particular altered spinal dopaminergic modulation, may be variably involved in PD patients with RLS symptoms. In addition, there is now evidence that the nigrostriatal system, primarily involved in PD, is also affected in RLS. Furthermore, an association of RLS with the parkin mutation has been suggested. The prevalence of RLS has also been reported to be increased in other disorders of dopamine regulation. However, clinical association studies and functional imaging have produced mixed findings. Conflicting accounts of emergence of RLS and improvement in RLS symptoms after deep brain stimulation (DBS) also contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the issue. Among the strongest arguments against a common pathophysiology is the role of iron in RLS and PD. While elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra contribute to oxidative stress in PD, RLS is a disorder of relative iron deficiency, with symptoms responding to replacement therapy. Recent ultrasonography studies have suggested that, despite overlapping clinical features, the mechanisms underlying idiopathic RLS and RLS associated with PD may differ.

A recording microelectrode and a DBS macroelectrode were advanced through the GPi in parallel until a single neuron was isolated.

The intra-operative stimulation parameters (1-8 V, 88-180 Hz, 0.1-ms pulses) were comparable with the postoperative DBS settings.

Most neurons had decreased activity during stimulation, although some increased or did not change firing rate. Thirty-three of 45 neurons displayed complex patterns of entrainment during stimulation, and burst-firing was decreased consistently after stimulation. Recorded spike trains from patients were used as input into a model of a thalamocortical relay neuron.

These support an idea that the pathological discharge interrupts normal information flow in the basal ganglia. Taken together, changes of firing pattern in the basal ganglia may be crucial for the PD pathophysiology, not a simple increase or decrease in firing rates.

At the same time, auditory and visual evoked bursts occurred in the subiculum, even though the subiculum was unresponsive to both stimuli previous to the transition.

This model assumes that movement triggering is inhibited by default to prevent automatic responses to unpredictable events. We investigated to which extent the top-down control necessary to release this locking state before initiating actions is impaired in PD and restored by standard therapies. We used a cue-target reaction time task to test both the ability to initiate fast responses to targets and the ability to refrain from reacting to cues. Fourteen patients with dopaminergic (DA) medication and 11 with subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation were tested on and off treatment, and compared with 14 healthy controls. We found evidence that patients withdrawn from treatment have trouble voluntarily releasing proactive inhibitory control; while DA medication broadly reduces movement initiation latency, it does not reinstate a normal pattern of movement initiation; and stimulation of the STN specifically re-establishes the efficiency of the top-down control of proactive inhibition.

However, the extent to which the basal ganglia might be involved in motor performance later on in a sustained contraction is less clear. We therefore recorded from the subthalamic nucleus region (STNr) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as they made maximal voluntary grips. Relative to age-matched controls they had more rapid force decrement when contraction was meant to be sustained and prolonged release reaction time and slower rate of force offset when they were supposed to release the grip. These impairments were independent from medication status. Increased STNr power over 5-12 Hz (in the theta/alpha band) independently predicted better performance-reduced force decrement, shortened release reaction time and faster rate of force offset. In contrast, lower mean levels and progressive reduction of STNr power over 55-375 Hz (high gamma/high frequency) over the period when contraction was meant to be sustained were both strongly associated with greater force decrement over time. Higher power over 13-23 Hz (low beta) was associated with more rapid force decrement during the period when grip should have been sustained, and with a paradoxical shortening of the release reaction time. These observations suggest that STNr activities at 5-12 Hz and 55-375 Hz are necessary for optimal grip performance and that deficiencies of such activities lead to motor impairments. In contrast, increased levels of 13-25 Hz activity both promote force decrement and shorten the release reaction time, consistent with a role in antagonising (and terminating) voluntary movement. Frequency specific oscillatory activities in the STNr impact on motor performance from the beginning to the end of a voluntary grip.", "pages": "1030-41"}, {"volume": "66C", "title": "Basal ganglia-cortical interactions in Parkinsonian patients.", "issue": "", "pmid": "15956009", "authors": ["Marreiros, AC", "Cagnan, H", "Moran, RJ", "Friston, KJ", "Brown, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Alcohol dependency can be considered as a chronic mental disorder characterized by frequent relapses even when treated with appropriate medical or psychotherapeutic interventions.

DBS involves stereotactic surgical implantation of a battery-operated stimulator into deep brain nuclei. Irish patients are referred abroad for DBS and have to travel repeatedly for pre and post-operative care resulting in stress, anxiety and hardship. Safe pre and post-operative care of these complex, ageing patients is compromised by the absence of a DBS service in Ireland. Moreover, both DBS surgery and the subsequent post-operative care abroad incurs substantial cost to the state. The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (DNI) is a non-profit institute for the care of patients with neurological diseases. The DNI developed, in collaboration with the Mater Private Hospital (MPH) and the Walton Centre, Liverpool, a DBS programme in 2008/2009.
