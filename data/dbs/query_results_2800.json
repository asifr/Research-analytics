There has been limited literature regarding short-term outcomes and no literature regarding long-term outcomes for refractory cervical dystonia following DBS of the STN. Materials and Methods.\u2002Two patients with medically refractory cervical dystonia underwent STN DBS. Patients were rated using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) preoperatively and immediately postoperatively as well as just prior to turning on the stimulators and subsequently at 24-48 hours, six months, one, two, and three years after stimulation. Microrecordings were used to identify the STN and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr). Results.\u2002Significant immediate and sustained long-term improvements were seen in motor, disability, pain, and total TWSTRS scores. In one patient, only unilateral stimulation was required. The STN and SNr were easily identified as having activity similar to off-state Parkinson's patients. Conclusions.\u2002DBS therapy for cervical dystonia utilizing the STN as the surgical target may be novel and may be an alternative target to the globus pallidus internus as supported by this first long-term outcome report.

Since the basal ganglia are thought to be involved in the generation of voluntary movements under internal control, we hypothesized that voluntary saccades would show improvements with STN DBS. Materials and Methods.\u2002Seven PD patients with STN DBS performed visually guided and internally generated (anti- and memory-guided) saccades with STN DBS on and off following 12 hours of levodopa withdrawal. The change in saccade reaction time, first saccade gain, and final saccade gain with STN DBS were measured.

Altered functional connectivity, cerebral structural reorganization as well as behavioral amelioration after invasive treatments will be discussed as the main indices for plasticity in these challenging patients.

In the present study, we examined the effect of STN DBS on reaction time (RT) performance and parallel changes in neural activity in the cortico-basal ganglia regions of partially bilateral DA- lesioned rats. We recorded neural activity with a multiple-channel single-unit electrode system in the primary motor cortex (MI), the STN, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) during RT test. RT performance was severely impaired following bilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the dorsolateral part of the striatum. In parallel with such behavioral impairments, the number of responsive neurons to different behavioral events was remarkably decreased after DA lesion. Bilateral STN DBS improved RT performance in 6-OHDA lesioned rats, and restored operational behavior-related neural responses in cortico-basal ganglia regions. These behavioral and electrophysiological effects of DBS lasted nearly an hour after DBS termination. These results demonstrate that a partial DA lesion-induced impairment of RT performance is associated with changes in neural activity in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit.

These changes have been linked to a disturbance in the STN's limbic territory, which is thought to be involved in emotional processing. This was confirmed by a recent PET study where these emotional modifications were correlated with changes in glucose metabolism in different brain regions, including the amygdala and the orbitofrontal regions that are well known for their involvement in emotional processing. Nevertheless, the question as to whether these emotional changes induced by STN DBS in PD are modality-specific has yet to be answered. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the effects of STN DBS in PD on the recognition of emotional prosody. An original emotional prosody paradigm was administered to twenty-one post-operative PD patients, twenty-one pre-operative PD patients and twenty-one matched controls. Results showed that both the pre- and post-operative groups differed from the healthy controls. There was also a significant difference between the pre and post groups. More specifically, an analysis of their continuous judgments revealed that the performance of the post-operative group compared with that of the other two groups was characterized by a systematic emotional bias whereby they perceived emotions more strongly. These results suggest that the impaired recognition of emotions may not be specific to the visual modality but may also be present when emotions are expressed through the human voice, implying the involvement of the STN in the brain network underlying the recognition of emotional prosody.", "pages": "26-30"}, {"volume": "2009", "title": "Neuronal pathways involved in deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for treatment of Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "14733174", "authors": ["Lester, DB", "Rogers, TD", "Blaha, CD"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

We tested the hypothesis in patients with Parkinson's disease in whom we had measured the changes of blood flow everywhere in the brain associated with the deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. We determined the emotional reactivity of the patients as the average impact of emotive images rated by the patients off the DBS. We then searched for sites in the brain that had significant correlation of the changes of blood flow with the emotional impact rated by the patients. The results indicate a significant link between the emotional impact when patients are not stimulated and the change of blood flow associated with the DBS. In subjects with a low emotional impact, activity measured as blood flow rose when the electrode was turned on, while in subjects of high impact, the activity at this site in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex declined when the electrode was turned on.

Drug treatment and deep brain stimulation can ameliorate symptoms, but the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra eventually leads to severe motor dysfunction. The transplantation of stem cells has emerged as a promising approach to replace lost neurons in order to restore dopamine levels in the striatum and reactivate functional circuits. We have generated substrate-adherent embryonic stem cell-derived neural aggregates overexpressing the neural cell adhesion molecule L1, because it has shown beneficial functions after central nervous system injury. L1 enhances neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration, differentiation and survival as well as myelination. In a previous study, L1 was shown to enhance functional recovery in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. In another study, a new differentiation protocol for murine embryonic stem cells was established allowing the transplantation of stem cell-derived neural aggregates consisting of differentiated neurons and radial glial cells into the lesioned brain. In the present study, this embryonic stem cell line was engineered to overexpress L1 constitutively at all stages of differentiation and used to generate stem cell-derived neural aggregates. These were monitored in their effects on stem cell survival and differentiation, rescue of endogenous dopaminergic neurons and ability to influence functional recovery after transplantation in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Female C57BL/6J mice (2 months old) were treated with the mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine intraperitoneally to deplete dopaminergic neurons selectively, followed by unilateral transplantation of stem cell-derived neural aggregates into the striatum. Mice grafted with L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates showed better functional recovery when compared to mice transplanted with wild-type stem cell-derived neural aggregates and vehicle-injected mice. Morphological analysis revealed increased numbers and migration of surviving transplanted cells, as well as increased numbers of dopaminergic neurons, leading to enhanced levels of dopamine in the striatum ipsilateral to the grafted side in L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates, when compared to wild-type stem cell-derived neural aggregates. The striatal levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid were not affected by L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates. Furthermore, L1 overexpressing, but not wild-type stem cell-derived neural aggregates, enhanced survival of endogenous host dopaminergic neurons after transplantation adjacent to the substantia nigra pars compacta. Thus, L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates enhance survival and migration of transplanted cells, differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, survival of endogenous dopaminergic neurons, and functional recovery after syngeneic transplantation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "26-30"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Construction of relational topographies from the quantitative measurements of functional deep brain stimulation using a 'roving window' interpolation algorithm.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "20037524", "authors": ["Shenai, MB", "Walker, H", "Guthrie, S", "Watts, R", "Guthrie, BL"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely employed therapeutic modality for the treatment of movement disorders.

We hypothesize that clinically effective high frequency DBS suppresses disordered neuronal activity in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), a primary output structure of the basal ganglia. In a computational model of the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, periodic high frequency (>100 Hz) stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus reduced the incidence of thalamic cell errors, from the high error rates seen in the parkinsonian case back to the low error rates seen in the normal-healthy case. In contrast, both low frequency (<70 Hz) DBS and high frequency aperiodic DBS failed to alleviate thalamic errors. In high error rate conditions, disordered patterns of GPi activity lead to irregular synaptic inhibition of thalamus. In low error rate conditions, ordered patterns of GPi activity lead to regular synaptic inhibition of thalamus. Linear regression revealed that the variance of the GPi synaptic output accounted for 87-97% of the changes in thalamic error rate. In contrast, the average GPi synaptic output - a measure of total GPi activity--accounted for only 25-50% of the changes in thalamic error rate.

Here we examine whether such convergence occurs subcortically in the macaque thalamus. We searched the ventral posterior nuclei, including the anterior pulvinar, as well as the ventro-lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, areas that receive vestibular signals from brain stem and deep cerebellar nuclei. Approximately a quarter of cells responded to three-dimensional (3D) translational and/or rotational motion. More than half of the responsive cells were convergent, thus responded during both rotation and translation. The preferred axes of translation/rotation were distributed throughout 3D space. The majority of the neurons were excited, but some were inhibited, during rotation/translation in darkness. Only a couple of neurons were multisensory being tuned to both vestibular and optic flow stimuli. We conclude that multisensory vestibular/optic flow neurons, which are commonly found in cortical visual and visuomotor areas, are rare in the ventral posterior thalamus.", "pages": "26-30"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Interruption of deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus in primary generalized dystonia.", "issue": "16", "pmid": "18588986", "authors": ["Grabli, D", "Ewenczyk, C", "Coelho-Braga, MC", "Lagrange, C", "Fraix, V", "Cornu, P", "Benabid, AL", "Vidailhet, M", "Pollak, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Two broad hypotheses have been advanced to explain the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. One is that stimulation inactivates STN neurons, producing a functional lesion. The other is that electrical stimulation activates the STN output, thus \"jamming\" pathological activity in basal ganglia-corticothalamic circuits. Evidence consistent with both concepts has been adduced from modeling and animal studies, as well as from recordings in patients. However, the stimulation parameters used in many recording studies have not been well matched to those used clinically. In this study, we recorded STN activity in patients with Parkinson's disease during stimulation delivered through a clinical DBS electrode using standard therapeutic stimulus parameters. A microelectrode was used to record the firing of a single STN neuron during DBS (3-5 V, 80-200 Hz, 90- to 200-micros pulses; 33 neurons/11 patients). Firing rate was unchanged during the stimulus trains, and the recorded neurons did not show prolonged (s) changes in firing rate on termination of the stimulation. However, a brief (approximately 1 ms), short-latency (6 ms) postpulse inhibition was seen in 10 of 14 neurons analyzed. A subset of neurons displayed altered firing patterns, with a predominant shift toward random firing. These data do not support the idea that DBS inactivates the STN and are instead more consistent with the hypothesis that this stimulation provides a null signal to basal ganglia-corticothalamic circuitry that has been altered as part of Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "26-30"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Treating complex movement disorders in children with cerebral palsy.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "18598773", "authors": ["Lundy, C", "Lumsden, D", "Fairhurst, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "The Ulster medical journal", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, an effective treatment for medication-refractory Parkinson's disease (PD), may also lead to selective cognitive declines.

We used group statistical comparisons as well as Reliable Change Indexes (RCIs) to examine performance on measures of memory, processing speed, executive function, and visuospatial perception at baseline and 16 months after surgery. Significant between-group differences were noted on a psychomotor processing speed task. However, a significantly higher proportion of DBS patients than controls demonstrated reliable individual decline on a word list recall task (HVLT-R) and on several processing speed tests. Reliable improvements were noted on tests of visuospatial functioning. There was variability in individual outcome on executive functioning tests, with a small proportion of DBS patients demonstrating reliable decline and some demonstrating reliable improvement. Use of Reliable Change highlights the occurrence of individual variability, revealing declines and improvements in a small proportion of unilateral DBS patients that were not evident upon group comparison.

This review outlines the main arguments for the use of cortical stimulation in PD: the widespread cortical dysfunction that could be corrected by cortical stimulation; the main mechanism of action of subthalamic nucleus stimulation that could take place within the primary motor cortex; and the ability of cortical stimulation to modulate basal ganglia activity by exciting cortico-basal ganglia projections. Such neuromodulatory effects could correspond to either stimulus-locked changes in brain rhythms or delayed changes in synaptic plasticity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can produce transient improvement of motor performance when the primary motor cortex or the supplementary motor area is targeted. Alleviation of mood and cognitive disorders are rather observed when repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, to produce more permanent therapeutic effects, chronic stimulation using surgically implanted electrodes is necessary. For this purpose, epidural implantation is safer and should be used in preference to subdural implantation. Pioneering results of epidural motor cortex stimulation in PD have been published, but they relate to case reports and open studies, precluding any definitive conclusion. Epidural cortical stimulation is easy to perform and could be a valuable therapeutic alternative to deep-brain stimulation. However, new epidural leads need to be designed before considering the development of such a technique for PD treatment.", "pages": "26-30"}]
