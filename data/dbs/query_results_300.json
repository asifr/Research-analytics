In this study, a new model of the closed loop network is used to explore the generation and interaction of network oscillations and their suppression through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Under simulated dopamine depletion conditions, increased gain through the hyperdirect pathway resulted in the interaction of neural oscillations at different frequencies in the cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN), leading to the emergence of synchronized oscillations at a new intermediate frequency. Further increases in synaptic gain resulted in the cortex driving synchronous oscillatory activity throughout the network. When DBS was added to the model a progressive reduction in STN power at the tremor and beta frequencies was observed as the frequency of stimulation was increased, with resonance effects occurring for low frequency DBS (40 Hz) in agreement with experimental observations. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronous oscillations can arise within the network and how DBS may suppress unwanted oscillatory activity.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "381", "title": "DBS for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa.", "issue": "9875", "pmid": "23473848", "authors": ["Treasure, J", "Schmidt, U"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Lancet", "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is characterised by a chronic course that is refractory to treatment in many patients and has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder.

Recently, increased attention has focused on using microstimulation to restore functions as diverse as somatosensation and memory. However, how microstimulation changes the neural substrate is still not fully understood. Microstimulation may cause cortical changes that could either compete with or complement natural neural processes, and could result in neuroplastic changes rendering the region dysfunctional or even epileptic. As part of our efforts to produce neuroprosthetic devices and to further study the effects of microstimulation on the cortex, we stimulated and recorded from microelectrode arrays in the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (area 1) in two awake macaque monkeys. We applied a simple neuroprosthetic microstimulation protocol to a pair of electrodes in the area 1 array, using either random pulses or pulses time-locked to the recorded spiking activity of a reference neuron. This setup was replicated using a computer model of the thalamocortical system, which consisted of 1980 spiking neurons distributed among six cortical layers and two thalamic nuclei. Experimentally, we found that spike-triggered microstimulation induced cortical plasticity, as shown by increased unit-pair mutual information, while random microstimulation did not. In addition, there was an increased response to touch following spike-triggered microstimulation, along with decreased neural variability. The computer model successfully reproduced both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the experimental findings. The physiological findings of this study suggest that even simple microstimulation protocols can be used to increase somatosensory information flow.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "A new atlas localization approach for subthalamic nucleus utilizing Chinese visible human head datasets.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9852584", "authors": ["Huang, L", "Garcia, I", "Jen, HI", "Arenkiel, BR"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Suppression of excessively synchronous beta-band oscillatory activity in the brain is believed to suppress hypokinetic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Recently, a lot of interest has been devoted to desynchronizing delayed feedback deep brain stimulation (DBS). This type of synchrony control was shown to destabilize the synchronized state in networks of simple model oscillators as well as in networks of coupled model neurons. However, the dynamics of the neural activity in Parkinson's disease exhibits complex intermittent synchronous patterns, far from the idealized synchronous dynamics used to study the delayed feedback stimulation. This study explores the action of delayed feedback stimulation on partially synchronized oscillatory dynamics, similar to what one observes experimentally in parkinsonian patients. We employ a computational model of the basal ganglia networks which reproduces experimentally observed fine temporal structure of the synchronous dynamics. When the parameters of our model are such that the synchrony is unphysiologically strong, the feedback exerts a desynchronizing action. However, when the network is tuned to reproduce the highly variable temporal patterns observed experimentally, the same kind of delayed feedback may actually increase the synchrony. As network parameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to those favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may gradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed feedback DBS in Parkinson's disease may boost rather than suppress synchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful. The study also indicates that delayed feedback stimulation may not necessarily exhibit a desynchronization effect when acting on a physiologically realistic partially synchronous dynamics, and provides an example of how to estimate the stimulation effect.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Reciprocal connectivity between mitral cells and external plexiform layer interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb.", "issue": "", "pmid": "10526332", "authors": ["Chrastina, J", "Nov\u00e1k, Z", "Bal\u00e1\u017e, M", "R\u00edha, I", "Bo\u010dkov\u00e1, M", "Rektor, I"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in neural circuits", "abstract": "Infection constitutes a serious adverse event in deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, being responsible for difficult therapeutic decisions that may ultimately involve the removal of implanted material.

For each subject and condition, we measured NMRP expression during both movement and rest. Resting expression of the abnormal PD-related metabolic covariance pattern was likewise determined in the same subjects. NMRP expression was abnormally elevated (p < 0.001) in PD patients scanned in the nonmovement rest state. By contrast, network activity measured during movement did not differ from normal (p = 0.34). In the longitudinal cohort, abnormal increases in resting NMRP expression were evident at the earliest clinical stages (p < 0.05), which progressed significantly over time (p = 0.003). Analogous network changes were present at baseline in the treatment cohort (p = 0.001). These abnormalities improved with subthalamic nucleus stimulation (p < 0.005) but not levodopa (p = 0.25).

Here, we explore oscillatory gamma band activity recorded from the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus during motor performance in a Go/noGo task in 10 patients with essential tremor after implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes. We show that movement-related gamma activity is lateralized to the nucleus contralateral to the moved side similar to previous findings in the globus pallidus internus and the subthalamic nucleus. The onset of contralateral gamma band synchronization following imperative Go cues is positively correlated with reaction time. Remarkably, baseline levels of gamma activity shortly before the Go cue correlated with the reaction times. Here, faster responses occurred in patients with higher levels of pre-cue gamma activity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective analysis of the surgical, neurological, and radiological outcome of patients harboring supratentorial, subcortically located brain tumors or vascular malformations who are operated on through awake surgery and CSES. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI; either sensory-motor or language, based on the location) was performed in order to confirm the proximity to functional cortical areas. Major white matter tracts were investigated by MRI diffusion tensor fiber tracking (DTI-ft). The Rankin modified score was chosen to express the pre and postoperative functional neurological status. Immediate postoperative MRI was used to evaluate the extent of resection. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were selected. The main distance of the tumors from the cortical surface was 18.2mm (range 9-48mm). Neuronavigation was used to show the most direct route to the tumor (transsulcal or transgyral), but CSES was fundamental to adapt the surgical corridor to the functional topography both cortically and subcortically. If the transgyral route was chosen, CSES helped to detect a non-eloquent area. When a transsulcal route was preferred, CSES documented the presence or absence of function in the deep sulcus. The transient postoperative morbidity was 76.4%, but at last follow-up (range 4-20 months), all the patients regained preoperative status and 2 improved. Postoperative MRI demonstrated complete resection in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Approaching purely subcortical tumors requires microsurgical skills, but in eloquent areas, functional topography monitoring is mandatory to allow safe surgery.

In prominent models of olfactory bulb circuitry, inhibition of mitral cells by local interneurons sharpens odor tuning and provides contrast enhancement. Mitral cell inhibition occurs at both mitral cell apical dendrites and deep-layer dendrodendritic synapses between granule cells, the most abundant population of inhibitory interneurons in the olfactory bulb. However, it remains unclear whether other local interneurons make inhibitory connections onto mitral cells. Here, we report a novel circuitry with strong and reciprocal connectivity between a subpopulation of previously uncharacterized Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)-expressing interneurons located in the external plexiform layer (EPL), and mitral cells. Using cell type-specific genetic manipulations, imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and electrophysiological recordings, we reveal that CRH-expressing EPL interneurons strongly inhibit mitral cell firing, and that they are reciprocally excited by fast glutamatergic mitral cell input. These findings functionally identify a novel subpopulation of olfactory bulb interneurons that show reciprocal connectivity with mitral cells, uncovering a previously unknown, and potentially critical player in olfactory bulb circuitry that may influence lateral interactions and/or facilitate odor processing.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Biomechanical loading as an alternative treatment for tremor: a review of two approaches.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22203725", "authors": ["Rocon, E", "Gallego, J\u00c1", "Belda-Lois, JM", "Benito-Le\u00f3n, J", "Luis Pons, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "Introduction. Although microrecording is common in subthalamic stimulation, microelectrode monitoring prolongs surgical time and may increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications. The main reason for electrophysiological mapping is the discrepancy between the calculated anatomical and final electrophysiological targets. The aim of this paper is to describe the relationship between anatomical and electrophysiological targets defined as the best electrophysiological recordings from multiple parallel electrode tracts, explaining the target discrepancy with attention paid to the role of brain shift and patient- and disease-related factors. Materials and methods. Subthalamic electrodes were stereotactically implanted in 58 patients using microrecording by means of parallel electrodes at defined distances. The relationship between the final electrode placement to its anatomical trajectory and the relationship between the definitive electrodes implanted on the right and left sides were analysed, as was the influence of patient age, Parkinson's disease duration, and late motor complications duration. Results. Final electrode placement matched the anatomical trajectory in 53.4% of patients on the right side and 43.1% of patients on the left side. Electrode positions were symmetrical in 38.3% of patients. The analysis of left and right electrode positions does not prove a statistically significant prevalence of lateral and posterior final electrode trajectories as could be expected from lateral and posterior movements of the brain caused by brain shift, although there was some tendency for a larger percentage of lateral electrodes on the left side. Age, Parkinson's disease duration, and L-DOPA effect duration were not confirmed as responsible factors. Conclusions. The difference between anatomical trajectory and final electrode placement supports the use of functional microelectrode monitoring in subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Brain shift is not the only causative factor of the difference. The possible roles of age, Parkinson's disease duration, and late motor complications duration were also not confirmed by study results.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Cerebellar Ataxia from Multiple Potential Causes: Hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Thalamic Stimulation, and Essential Tremor.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22493252", "authors": ["Shneyder, N", "Lyons, MK", "Driver-Dunckley, E", "Evidente, VG"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) reduces motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) but its effect on non-motor fluctuations (NMF) is not well known.

During deep brain stimulation surgeries, detailed anatomical images can be combined with physiological data obtained by microelectrode recordings and microstimulations to address questions relating to the location of specific motor or sensorial functions. The main advantage of techniques such as microelectrode recordings and microstimulations over brain imaging is their ability to localize patient physiological activity with a high degree of spatial resolution. Aggregating data acquired from large populations permits to build what are commonly referred to as statistical atlases. Data points from statistical atlases can be combined to produce probabilistic maps. A crucial step in this process is the intersubject spatial normalization that is required to relate a position in one subject's brain to a position in another subject's brain. In this paper, we study the impact of spatial normalization techniques on building statistical atlases. We find that the Talairach or anterior-posterior commissure coordinate system commonly used in the medical literature produces atlases that are more dispersed than those obtained with normalization methods that rely on nonlinear volumetric image registration.

However, several recent studies have found an association between STN-DBS and increased impulsivity. Currently, it is not clear whether the observed increase in impulsivity results from STN-DBS per se, or whether it involves an interaction with the underlying PD neuropathology and/or intake of dopaminergic drugs. We investigated the effects of STN-DBS on performance of intact rats on two tasks measuring impulsive responding: a novel rat gambling task (rGT) and a differential reinforcement of low rate responding (DRL20s) schedule. Following initial behavioural training, animals received electrode implantation into the STN (n=24) or sham surgery (n=24), and were re-tested on their assigned behavioural task, with or without STN-DBS. Bilateral STN-DBS administered for two hours immediately prior to testing, had no effects on rGT choice behaviour or on DRL response inhibition (p>0.05). However, STN-DBS significantly increased premature responding in the rGT task (p=0.0004), an effect that took several sessions to develop and persisted in subsequent trials when no stimulation was given. Consistent with the notion of distinct facets of impulsivity with unique neurochemical underpinnings, we observed differential effects of STN-DBS in the two tasks employed. These results suggest that STN-DBS in the absence of parkinsonism may not lead to a general loss of inhibitory control, but may instead affect impulsivity under specific conditions.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "2012", "title": "Quantification of uncertainties in brain tissue conductivity in a heterogeneous model of deep brain stimulation using a non-intrusive projection approach.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16614837", "authors": ["Muthuraman, M", "Paschen, S", "Hellriegel, H", "Groppa, S", "Deuschl, G", "Raethjen, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Although cervical dystonia is the most common idiopathic focal dystonia, evidence for long-term responsiveness to pallidal stimulation is limited. The primary objective of this study was to prospectively collect outcome data from baseline to last clinical follow-up on patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia treated with bilateral pallidal stimulation. Blinded video assessment of examinations performed preoperatively and at last video assessment were performed. Ten patients had complete prospective clinical follow-up. Baseline total Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale score (\u00b1standard deviation) was 54.5 \u00b1 12.4 (range, 35.0-70.3). Comparison of the blinded severity sub-score on baseline video and at last video assessment at a mean of 7.7 years postoperatively demonstrated a mean improvement of 47.6% (P = 0.002) and strong inter-observer correlation between blinded raters (Spearman r = 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.92, P = 0.0001). All 10 patients had 5 years of open prospective follow-up, documenting a 47.4 \u00b1 26.4% (P < 0.01) mean improvement with respect to baseline. This was maintained at a mean of 7.8 years at last follow-up after surgery (range, 4.9-10.7 years) with a 54.4 \u00b1 27.4% mean improvement (P < 0.01). Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus is an effective and long-lasting second-line treatment of cervical dystonia, with benefit in some of our patients extending to >10 years. More data are needed to explain variations in individual responses and to guide individual programming parameters.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "80", "title": "Neuronal activity correlated with checking behaviour in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "17624604", "authors": ["Joint, C", "Thevathasan, W", "Green, AL", "Aziz, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) that belongs to a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) plays diverse roles in the central nervous system. Activation of ERK1/2 has been observed in various types of neuronal excitation, including seizure activity in vivo and in vitro, as well as in NMDA-receptor (NMDA-R)-dependent long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. On the other hand, recent studies in cultured neurons have shown that NMDA-R stimulation could result in either ERK1/2 activation or non-activation, depending on the pharmacological manipulations. To assess NMDA-R-dependent regulation of ERK1/2 activity in vivo, here we examined the effect of NMDA-R-induced seizure activity on ERK1/2 activation by using rat cortical slice preparations. NMDA-R-dependent seizure activity introduced by Mg2+ -free condition did not cause ERK1/2 activation. On the other hand, when picrotoxin was added to concurrently suppress GABAA-receptor-mediated inhibition, profound ERK1/2 activation occurred, which was accompanied by strong phospho-ERK1/2-staining in the superficial and deep cortical layer neurons. In this case, prolonged membrane depolarization and enhanced burst action potential firings, both of which were much greater than those in Mg2+ -free condition alone, were observed. Differential ERK1/2 activation was supported by the concurrent selective increase in phosphorylation of a substrate protein, phospho-site 4/5 of synapsin I. These results indicate that NMDA-R activation through a release from Mg2+ -blockade, which accompanies enhancement of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, was not enough, but concurrent suppression of GABAergic inhibition, which leads to a selective increase in excitatory synaptic transmission, was necessary for robust ERK1/2 activation to occur within the cortical network.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Pallidal somatotopy suggested by deep brain stimulation in a patient with dystonia.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17721929", "authors": ["Sheard, JM", "Ash, S", "Silburn, PA", "Kerr, GK"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The journal of nutrition, health & aging", "abstract": "Interest in using neuromodulation to treat psychiatric disorders is rapidly increasing. The development of novel tools and techniques, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), increases precision and minimizes risk. This article reviews the history of psychosurgical interventions and recent developments of DBS to provide a framework for understanding current options and future goals. We begin by discussing early approaches to psychosurgery, focusing on the widespread use of lobotomy and the subsequent backlash from the public and professionals in the field. Next, we discuss the development of stereotaxis. This technique allows for more targeted, precise interventions that produce discrete subcortical lesions. We focus on four stereotactic procedures that were developed using this technique: cingulotomy, capsulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and limbic leucotomy. We subsequently review contemporary theory and approaches with relevance to psychosurgery. We discuss the systems and neurocircuitry that are thought to be involved in psychiatric illness and provide targets for intervention. This discussion includes presentation of basal ganglia thalamocortical pathophysiology including cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. We focus the discussion on two psychiatric disorders that have been targets of neurosurgical interventions: obsessive-compulsive disorder and mood disorders such as major depressive disorder. Evidence from studies of DBS in psychiatric disorders, including efficacy and tolerability, is reviewed. Finally, we look to the future, exploring the possibilities for these approaches to increase understanding, transform societal views of mental illness, and improve treatment.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "368", "title": "Nutritional status in Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery: a pilot study.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "18221864", "authors": ["Vidal, EI", "Fukushima, FB", "Boas, PV"], "year": "2013", "journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a progressive neurologic disorder afflicting approximately 1 percent of Americans older than 60 years. The cardinal features of Parkinson disease are bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. There are a number of neurologic conditions that mimic the disease, making it difficult to diagnose in its early stages. Physicians who rarely diagnose Parkinson disease should refer patients suspected of having it to physicians with more experience in making the diagnosis, and should periodically reevaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis. Treatment is effective in reducing motor impairment and disability, and should be started when a patient begins to experience functional impairment. The combination of carbidopa and levodopa is the most effective treatment, but dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors are also effective, and are less likely to cause dyskinesias. For patients taking carbidopa/levodopa who have motor complications, adjunctive therapy with a dopamine agonist, a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, or a catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor will improve motor symptoms and functional status, but with an increase in dyskinesias. Deep brain stimulation is effective in patients who have poorly controlled symptoms despite optimal medical therapy. Occupational, physical, and speech therapy improve patient function. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, dementia, and depression are common in patients with Parkinson disease.

METHODS: Between 2004 and 2006, we selected four patients affected by cluster headache. The diagnosis was based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders II criteria, and all patients were refractory to drug therapy. Under local anesthesia they underwent stereotactic positioning of a stimulation electrode within the posterior hypothalamus, ipsilateral to the site of pain. An intraoperative neurophysiological test stimulation was performed to assess possible side effects and symptoms related to hypothalamic neuronal activity. A\u00a0second surgery was then performed with the patient under general anesthesia to implant the extension cable and the implantable pulse generator. RESULTS: After 5 years of follow up, all patients had a valuable benefit with a reduction in episode frequency from 90% to 50% associated with a decrease in pain intensity perception. CONCLUSION: The long-lasting pain reduction and the improvement in the patients' symptoms should be considered a real positive prospective, not only because there was uncertainty about the persistence of the beneficial effects at a long-term follow-up, but also for the improvement of the quality of life. The stimulation can restore important aspects concerning the psychic condition that very often constitutes an important limiting factor in normal daily life for this type of patient.", "pages": "244-53"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18784271", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "Tremor can dominate Parkinson's disease and yet responds less well to dopaminergic medications than do other cardinal symptoms of this condition [1, 2]. Deep brain stimulation can provide striking tremor relief, but the introduction of stimulating electrodes deep in the substance of the brain carries significant risks, including those of hemorrhage [3]. Here, we pioneer an alternative approach in which we noninvasively apply transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) over the motor cortex [4, 5] to induce phase cancellation of the rest tremor rhythm. We first identify the timing of cortical oscillations responsible for rest tremor in the periphery by delivering tremor-frequency stimulation over motor cortex but do not couple this stimulation to the on-going tremor-instead, the rhythms simply \"drift\" in and out of phase alignment with one another. Slow alternating periods of phase cancellation and reinforcement result, informing on the phase alignments that induce the greatest change in tremor amplitude. Next, we deliver stimulation at these specified phase alignments to demonstrate controlled suppression of the on-going tremor. With this technique we can achieve almost 50% average reduction in resting tremor amplitude and in so doing form the basis of a closed-loop tremor-suppression therapy that could be extended to other oscillopathies.", "pages": ""}]
