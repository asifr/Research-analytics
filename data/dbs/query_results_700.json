The disorder is highly disruptive and in some cases completely debilitating. For those with severe, treatment-refractory TS, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a possible option, although its mechanism of action is not fully understood. We performed a longitudinal study of the effects of DBS on TS symptomatology while concomitantly examining neurophysiological dynamics. We present the first report of the clinical correlation between the presence of gamma band activity and decreased tic severity. Local field potential recordings from five subjects implanted in the centromedian nucleus (CM) of the thalamus revealed a temporal correlation between the power of gamma band activity and the clinical metrics of symptomatology as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale and the Modified Rush Tic Rating Scale. Additional studies utilizing short-term stimulation also produced increases in gamma power. Our results suggest that modulation of gamma band activity in both long-term and short-term DBS of the CM is a key factor in mitigating the pathophysiology associated with TS.", "pages": "e44215"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Neural Hijacking: Action of High-Frequency Electrical Stimulation on Cortical Circuits.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19400723", "authors": ["Cheney, PD", "Giffin, DM", "Van Acker, GM"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry", "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of the brain was one of the first experimental methods applied to understanding brain organization and function and it continues as a highly useful method both in research and clinical applications. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) involves applying electrical stimuli through a microelectrode suitable for recording the action potentials of single neurons. ICMS can be categorized into single-pulse stimulation; high-frequency, short-duration stimulation; and high-frequency, long-duration stimulation. For clinical and experimental reasons, considerable interest focuses on the mechanism of neural activation by electrical stimuli. In this article, we discuss recent results suggesting that action potentials evoked in cortical neurons by high-frequency electrical stimulation do not sum with the natural, behaviorally related background activity; rather, high-frequency stimulation eliminates and replaces natural activity. We refer to this as neural hijacking. We propose that a major component of the mechanism underlying neural hijacking is excitation of axons by ICMS and elimination of natural spikes by antidromic collision with stimulus-driven spikes evoked at high frequency. Evidence also supports neural hijacking as an important mechanism underlying the action of deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus and its therapeutic effect in treating Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "e44215"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Deep brain stimulation induces BOLD activation in motor and non-motor networks: an fMRI comparison study of STN and EN/GPi DBS in large animals.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20853121", "authors": ["Min, HK", "Hwang, SC", "Marsh, MP", "Kim, I", "Knight, E", "Striemer, B", "Felmlee, JP", "Welker, KM", "Blaha, CD", "Chang, SY", "Bennet, KE", "Lee, KH"], "year": "2012", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "The combination of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and functional MRI (fMRI) is a powerful means of tracing brain circuitry and testing the modulatory effects of electrical stimulation on a neuronal network in vivo.

We conducted DBS in normal anesthetized pigs, targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (n=7) and the entopeduncular nucleus (EN), the non-primate analog of the primate globus pallidus interna (n=4). Using a normalized functional activation map for group analysis and the application of general linear modeling across subjects, we found that both STN and EN/GPi DBS significantly increased BOLD activation in the ipsilateral sensorimotor network (FDR<0.001). In addition, we found differential, target-specific, non-motor network effects. In each group the activated brain areas showed a distinctive correlation pattern forming a group of network connections.

In many patients, such sensations correspond to neuropathic pain and could be related to central alterations of pain processing. Subthalamic nuclei deep brain stimulation improves motor function in Parkinson's disease. Several structures of the basal ganglia are involved in nociceptive function, and deep brain stimulation could thus also modify pain perception in Parkinson's disease. To test this hypothesis, we compared subjective heat pain thresholds, in deep brain stimulation OFF and ON conditions in 2 groups of Parkinson's disease patients with or without neuropathic pain. We also compared pain-induced cerebral activations during experimental nociceptive stimulations using H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography in both deep brain stimulation OFF and ON conditions. Correlation analyses were performed between clinical and neuroimaging results. Deep brain stimulation significantly increased subjective heat pain threshold (from 40.3 \u00b1 4.2 to 41.6 \u00b1 4.3, P=.03) and reduced pain-induced cerebral activity in the somatosensory cortex (BA 40) in patients with pain, whereas it had no effect in pain-free patients. There was a significant negative correlation in the deep brain stimulation OFF condition between pain threshold and pain-induced activity in the insula of patients who were pain free but not in those who had pain. There was a significant positive correlation between deep brain stimulation-induced changes in pain threshold and in pain-induced cerebral activations in the primary somatosensory cortex and insula of painful patients only.

However, DBS may produce emotional disorders such as a reduced ability to recognize emotional facial expressions (EFE). Previous studies have not considered the fact that DBS and l-dopa medication can have differential, common, or complementary consequences on EFE processing. A thorough way of investigating the effect of DBS and l-dopa medication in greater detail is to compare patients' performances after surgery, with the two therapies either being administered ('on') or not administered ('off'). We therefore used a four-condition (l-dopa 'on'/DBS 'on', l-dopa 'on'/DBS 'off', l-dopa 'off'/DBS 'on', and l-dopa 'off'/DBS 'off') EFE recognition paradigm and compared implanted PD patients to healthy controls. The results confirmed those of previous studies, yielding a significant impairment in the detection of some facial expressions relative to controls. Disgust recognition was impaired when patients were 'off' l-dopa and 'on' DBS, and fear recognition impaired when 'off' of both therapies. More interestingly, the combined effect of both DBS and l-dopa administration seems much more beneficial for EFE recognition than the separate administration of each individual therapy. We discuss the implications of these findings in the light of the inverted U curve function that describes the differential effects of dopamine level on the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We propose that, while l-dopa could \"overdose\" in dopamine the ventral stream of the OFC, DBS would compensate for this over-activation by decreasing OFC activity, thereby restoring the necessary OFC-amygdala interaction.

They are associated with abnormal brain rhythms, including disturbances in \u03b3 frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations (GFO) in cortex-related networks. However, the underlying anatomofunctional mechanisms remain elusive. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that these deficits result from a hyporegulation of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Here we modeled these deficits in rats with ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and a translational psychotomimetic substance at subanesthetic doses. We tested the hypothesis that ketamine-induced sensory deficits involve an impairment of the ability of the thalamocortical (TC) system to discriminate the relevant information from the baseline activity. Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether ketamine disrupts synaptic plasticity in TC systems. We conducted multisite network recordings in the rat somatosensory TC system, natural stimulation of the vibrissae and high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the thalamus. A single systemic injection of ketamine increased the amount of baseline GFO, reduced the amplitude of the sensory-evoked TC response and decreased the power of the sensory-evoked GFO. Furthermore, cortical application of ketamine elicited local and distant increases in baseline GFO. The ketamine effects were transient. Unexpectedly, HFS of the TC pathway had opposite actions. In conclusion, ketamine and thalamic HFS have opposite effects on the ability of the somatosensory TC system to discriminate the sensory-evoked response from the baseline GFO during information processing.

We hypothesized that ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus stimulation for essential tremor activates the cortex at short latencies, and that this potential is related to the suppression of tremor in the contralateral arm. We measured cortical activity with electroencephalography in 5 subjects (seven brain hemispheres) across a range of stimulator settings, and reversal of the anode and cathode electrode contacts minimized the stimulus artifact, allowing visualization of brain activity. Regression quantified the relationship between stimulation parameters and both the peak of the short latency potential and tremor suppression. Stimulation generated a polyphasic event-related potential in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, with peaks at discrete latencies beginning less than 1 ms after stimulus onset (mean latencies 0.9 \u00b1 0.2, 5.6 \u00b1 0.7, and 13.9 \u00b1 1.4 ms, denoted R1, R2, and R3, respectively). R1 showed more fixed timing than the subsequent peaks in the response (P < 0.0001, Levene's test), and R1 amplitude and frequency were both closely associated with tremor suppression (P < 0.0001, respectively). These findings demonstrate that effective VIM thalamic stimulation for essential tremor activates the cerebral cortex at approximately 1 ms after the stimulus pulse.

A D2R antagonist, raclopride, was administered into the dorsal striatum or spinally in attempts to reverse spinal antinociception induced by M1 stimulation. Moreover, influence of M1 stimulation on the noxious heat-induced limb withdrawal reflex was determined following block of spinal D2Rs with raclopride or a lidocaine-induced block of the hypothalamic A11 cell group, the main source of spinal dopamine. Striatal administration of raclopride enhanced the heat-evoked baseline responses of WDR but not NS neurons and reversed the M1 stimulation-induced suppression of the heat response in WDR neurons.

The increase of stimulation frequency from 6 to 130 Hz (1.2 V, 300 \u00b5 sec) showed progressive reduction in the amplitude and disappearance of the time-locked recruiting responses, especially from around 60 Hz.", "pages": "e44215"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Broad spectrum of dystonia associated with a novel thanatosis-associated protein domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1 mutation in a Japanese family with dystonia 6, torsion.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "20644423", "authors": ["Miyamoto, R", "Ohta, E", "Kawarai, T", "Koizumi, H", "Sako, W", "Izumi, Y", "Obata, F", "Kaji, R"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Bilateral hippocampal and cortical recruiting responses were easily obtained in all animals after low-frequency hippocampal unilateral stimulation. High-frequency stimulation did not give rise to recruiting response, although a DC shift was noted. The fact that unilateral hippocampal stimulation might lead to bilateral limbic system modulation suggested that unilateral stimulation might be enough in many situations. Our findings suggested that high-frequency stimulation was more likely to be effective than low-frequency stimulation regarding the potential inactivation of the hippocampus. These findings might prove relevant to the determination of the adequate parameters for stimulation using hippocampal deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the future. An increase in our knowledge on the physiologic mechanisms underlying DBS might be translated into more rational clinical approaches.", "pages": "e44215"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Beta reactivity, prospective facilitation of executive processing, and its dependence on dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "29", "pmid": "21395864", "authors": ["Oswal, A", "Litvak, V", "Sauleau, P", "Brown, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the basal ganglia improves motor outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD), its effects on cognition, including language, remain unclear. This study examined the impact of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS on two fundamental capacities of language, grammatical and lexical functions. These functions were tested with the production of regular and irregular past-tenses, which contrast aspects of grammatical (regulars) and lexical (irregulars) processing while controlling for multiple potentially confounding factors. Aspects of the motor system were tested by contrasting the naming of manipulated (motor) and non-manipulated (non-motor) objects. Performance was compared between healthy controls and early-stage PD patients treated with either DBS/medications or medications alone. Patients were assessed on and off treatment, with controls following a parallel testing schedule. STN-DBS improved naming of manipulated (motor) but not non-manipulated (non-motor) objects, as compared to both controls and patients with just medications, who did not differ from each other across assessment sessions. In contrast, STN-DBS led to worse performance at regulars (grammar) but not irregulars (lexicon), as compared to the other two subject groups, who again did not differ. The results suggest that STN-DBS negatively impacts language in early PD, but may be specific in depressing aspects of grammatical and not lexical processing. The finding that STN-DBS affects both motor and grammar (but not lexical) functions strengthens the view that both depend on basal ganglia circuitry, although the mechanisms for its differential impact on the two (improved motor, impaired grammar) remain to be elucidated.", "pages": "e44215"}, {"volume": "154", "title": "Robotic implantation of deep brain stimulation leads, assisted by intra-operative, flat-panel CT.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "21625231", "authors": ["Lefranc, M", "Le Gars, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "Many neurological and psychiatric diseases are associated with clinically detectable, altered brain dynamics. The aberrant brain activity, in principle, can be restored through electrical stimulation. In epilepsies, abnormal patterns emerge intermittently, and therefore, a closed-loop feedback brain control that leaves other aspects of brain functions unaffected is desirable. Here, we demonstrate that seizure-triggered, feedback transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can dramatically reduce spike-and-wave episodes in a rodent model of generalized epilepsy. Closed-loop TES can be an effective clinical tool to reduce pathological brain patterns in drug-resistant patients.", "pages": "e44215"}]
