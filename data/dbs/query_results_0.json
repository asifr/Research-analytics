Some studies have indicated that young patients with primary dystonia who have shorter disease duration and less severe dystonia are likely to have the best outcome from DBS. Therefore, surgery should not be delayed when disability and QoL are impaired to the extent that justifies the surgical risk. A case-by-case approach is recommended in patients who have secondary dystonia. The globus pallidus internus is considered the best target for dystonia.

Three general abnormalities appear to underlie the pathophysiological substrate. The first is a loss of inhibition. This makes sense considering that it may be responsible for the excess of movement and for the overflow phenomena seen in dystonia. A second abnormality is sensory dysfunction which is related to the mild sensory complaints in patients with focal dystonias and may be responsible for some of the motor dysfunction. Third, evidence from animal models of dystonia as well as from patients with primary dystonia has revealed significant alterations of synaptic plasticity characterized by a disruption of homeostatic plasticity, with a prevailing facilitation of synaptic potentiation, together with the loss of synaptic inhibitory processes. We speculate that during motor learning this abnormal plasticity may lead to an abnormal sensorimotor integration, leading to consolidation of abnormal motor engrams. If so, then removing this abnormal plasticity might have little immediate effect on dystonic movements because bad motor memories have already been ''learned'' and are difficult to erase. These considerations might explain the delayed clinical effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with generalized dystonia.

We believe that a network perspective is necessary to understand this common neurological symptom, and that knowledge of cerebral network dysfunction in tremor disorders will help to develop new therapies. Both essential tremor and Parkinson's tremor are associated with increased activity in the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. However, different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to tremulous activity within this circuit. In Parkinson's disease, evidence suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction of the pallidum triggers increased activity in the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. In essential tremor, GABAergic dysfunction of the cerebellar dentate nucleus and brain stem, possibly caused by neurodegeneration in these regions, may lead to tremulous activity within the cerebellothalamocortical circuit.

In most of these studies, the choice of stimulation parameters is critical to obtain desired clinical effects. In particular, the stimulation frequency is a key parameter that is difficult to tune. A reason is that our knowledge about the frequency-dependant mechanisms according to which DBS indirectly impacts the dynamics of pathological neuronal systems located in the neocortex is still limited. We address this issue using both computational modeling and intracerebral EEG (iEEG) data. We developed a macroscopic (neural mass) model of the thalamocortical network. In line with already-existing models, it includes interconnected neocortical pyramidal cells and interneurons, thalamocortical cells and reticular neurons. The novelty was to introduce, in the thalamic compartment, the biophysical effects of direct stimulation. Regarding clinical data, we used a quite unique data set recorded in a patient (drug-resistant epilepsy) with a focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). In this patient, DBS strongly reduced the sustained epileptic activity of the FCD for low-frequency (LFS, < 2 Hz) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS, > 70 Hz) while intermediate-frequency stimulation (IFS, around 50 Hz) had no effect. Signal processing, clustering, and optimization techniques allowed us to identify the necessary conditions for reproducing, in the model, the observed frequency-dependent stimulation effects. Key elements which explain the suppression of epileptic activity in the FCD include: (a) feed-forward inhibition and synaptic short-term depression of thalamocortical connections at LFS, and (b) inhibition of the thalamic output at HFS.

The activation of 256 model axons positioned around the electrodes was then quantified, showing that modified fractal geometries required a 22% less input power while maintaining the same level of neural activation. Preliminary in vivo experiments investigating muscle evoked potentials due to median nerve stimulation showed encouraging results, supporting the feasibility of increasing neural stimulation efficiency using modified fractal geometries.", "pages": "463-469"}, {"volume": "", "title": "A re-examination of neural basis of language processing: Proposal of a dynamic hodotopical model from data provided by brain stimulation mapping during picture naming.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23876322", "authors": ["Soreq, L", "Bergman, H", "Israel, Z", "Soreq, H"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Brain and language", "abstract": "This paper reviews the literature on the surgical treatment of refractory anorexia nervosa (AN) and examines how this literature can inform current circuit models of the disease. The literature contains reports of 35 patients undergoing a neurosurgical procedure for the specific treatment of refractory AN, with the first reported operation, a lobotomy, in 1950. All patients were deemed treatment resistant according to contemporary standards, with the nature of the procedure changing with evolving surgical techniques and methods. All procedures targeted the limbic system and, in a majority of cases, were associated with reported symptomatic improvement. Neurosurgery in AN has been, and continues to be, reserved for patients with chronic and life-threatening illness, for whom conventional treatment has failed. Early procedures, which were viewed as life-saving measures, were crude by today's standards but targeted anatomic structures and pathways implicated in modern models of AN. The last decade has seen a concerted effort in elucidating the neurocircuitry underlying prominent etiologic and maintaining factors in AN, including mood, anxiety and dysfunctional reward processing. This has translated into the development of novel, focused therapeutic options for patients with treatment-refractory AN.

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD, USA) was queried for 10 years beginning in 1999 for patients undergoing deep brain stimulator insertion, pallidotomy, and thalamotomy for treatment of PD, essential tremor, and dystonia. Inpatient complications, including death, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), and other overall complications were examined. The relative risks associated with advanced age; primary diagnosis; treatment modality; the diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, and nicotinism; and the cumulative number of comorbidities were examined. There were 5464 patients who met inclusion criteria, including 4145 patients treated for PD and 4961 patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Overall in-hospital mortality was 0.26%, with 0.15% related to surgical factors. There was a correlation between in-hospital mortality, increasing age, and number of medical comorbidities. After multivariate regression no factor remained predictive of mortality. Having more than 1 medical comorbidity or PD increased the risk of in-hospital complications. Patients with PD were more likely to suffer hemorrhage or stroke. Hypertension, diabetes, nicotinism, and modality of treatment were not associated with increased mortality, hemorrhage or stroke risk, or in-hospital mortality in univariate or multivariate analysis. Both age and medical comorbidity are correlated with in-hospital complications, but age appears to serve as a surrogate for comorbidity.

Future studies in this open environment can be used to examine other modulations that occur with different parameters of DBS under real-world conditions such as walking and balance tasks.", "pages": "463-469"}, {"volume": "", "title": "A new translational target for deep brain stimulation to treat depression.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23835430", "authors": ["Schmidt, S", "Scholz, M", "Obermayer, K", "Brandt, SA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "EMBO molecular medicine", "abstract": "We identify spatial co-localization between movement modulated beta (12-35 Hz) suppression in the cortex and movement modulated reductions in beta coherence between cortex and globus pallidus.

In this study, we show that the anatomical composition of the primate STN provides a substrate through which DBS may elicit widespread changes in brain activity via stimulation of fibers of passage. Using quantitative high-resolution electron microscopy, we found that the primate STN is traversed by numerous myelinated axons, which occupy as much as 45% of its sensorimotor territory and 36% of its associative region. In comparison, myelinated axons occupy only 27% of the surface areas of the sensorimotor and associative regions of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), another target for therapeutic DBS in PD. We also noted that myelinated axons in the STN, on average, have a larger diameter than those in GPi, which may render them more susceptible to electrical stimulation. Because axons are more excitable than other neuronal elements, our findings support the hypothesis that STN DBS, even when carried out entirely within the confines of the nucleus, mediates some of its effects by activating myelinated axons of passage. \u00a9 2013 Movement Disorder Society.", "pages": "463-469"}, {"volume": "39", "title": "[Electrophysiological control of stereotactic method for treatment of neuromotor dyskinesia and epilepsy].", "issue": "2", "pmid": "23797355", "authors": ["Trinh, B", "Ha, AD", "Mahant, N", "Kim, SD", "Owler, B", "Fung, VS"], "year": "", "journal": "Fiziologiia cheloveka", "abstract": "Over the last four decades, a range of different neuroimaging tools have been used to study human auditory attention, spanning from classic event-related potential studies using electroencephalography to modern multimodal imaging approaches (e.g., combining anatomical information based on magnetic resonance imaging with magneto- and electroencephalography).

We recorded the in-vivo impedances of brain tissues during neurosurgical procedures and used these results to construct MRI guided computational models of TMS and DBS neurostimulatory fields and conductance-based models of neurons exposed to stimulation. We demonstrated that tissues carry neurostimulation currents through frequency dependent resistive and capacitive properties not typically accounted for by past neurostimulation modeling work. We show that these fundamental brain tissue properties can have significant effects on the neurostimulatory-fields (capacitive and resistive current composition and spatial/temporal dynamics) and neural responses (stimulation threshold, ionic currents, and membrane dynamics).
