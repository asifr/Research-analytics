Although some of these procedures have been studied extensively, sham-controlled trials are sparse and the precise mode of action of such stimulation remains largely unknown.

The MEA was placed under the slice that contained the ACC, and 60 channels of extracellular local field potentials evoked by bipolar electrical stimulation within the thalamus were analyzed. Several distinct thalamic-evoked responses were identified. The early negative component (N1; amplitude, -35.7 \u00b1 5.9 \u03bcV) emerged in layer VI near the cingulum 8.4 \u00b1 0.5 ms after stimulation. N1 progressed upward to layers V and II/III in a lateral-to-medial direction. Subsequently, a positive component (P; amplitude, 27.0 \u00b1 3.2 \u03bcV) appeared 12.0 \u00b1 0.6 ms after stimulation in layer VI. At 26.8 \u00b1 1.1 ms, a second negative component (N2; amplitude, -20.9 \u00b1 2.7 \u03bcV) became apparent in layers II/III and V, followed by a more ventrolateral component (N3; amplitude, -18.9 \u00b1 2.9 \u03bcV) at 42.8 \u00b1 2.6 ms. These two late components spread downward to layer VI in a medial-to-lateral direction. The trajectory paths of the evoked components were consistently represented with varied medial thalamic stimulation intensities and sites. Both AMPA/kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors involved in monosynaptic and polysynaptic transmission participated in this thalamocortical pathway. Morphine mainly diminished the two negative synaptic components, and this suppressive effect was reversed by naloxone. The present study confirmed that functional thalamocingulate activity was preserved in the brain-slice preparation. The thalamus-evoked responses were activated and progressed along a deep surface-deep trajectory loop across the ACC layers. Glutamatergic neurotransmitters were crucially involved in information processing.

To restore this 'imbalance' in HD patients, which is held responsible for (some) of the motor symptoms, different basal ganglia nuclei have been targeted for surgical therapies, such as ablative surgery and deep brain stimulation. However, evidence to target brain nuclei for surgical therapies in HD is lacking. We reasoned that a neuronal and metabolic mapping of the basal ganglia nuclei could identify a functional substrate for therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic and neuronal activity of basal ganglia nuclei in a transgenic rat model of HD (tgHD). Subjects were 10-12 month old tgHD rats and wildtype littermates. We examined the striatum, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra at different levels. First, we determined the overall neuronal activity at a supracellular level, by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Secondly, we determined the subcellular metabolic activity, by immunohistochemistry for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 transcription co-activator (PGC-1\u03b1), a key player in the mitochondrial machinery. Finally, we performed extracellular single unit recordings in the nuclei to determine the cellular activity. In tgHD rats, optical density analysis showed a significantly increased cytochrome oxidase levels in the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus when compared to controls. PGC-1\u03b1 expression was only enhanced in the subthalamic nucleus and electrophysiological recordings revealed decreased firing frequency of the majority of the neurons in the globus pallidus and increased firing frequency of the majority of the neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. Altogether, our results suggest that the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus play a role in the neurobiology of HD and can be potential targets for therapeutic interventions.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "1265", "title": "The ethics of research on deep brain stimulation for depression: decisional capacity and therapeutic misconception.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22812719", "authors": ["Fisher, CE", "Dunn, LB", "Christopher, PP", "Holtzheimer, PE", "Leykin, Y", "Mayberg, HS", "Lisanby, SH", "Appelbaum, PS"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "abstract": "Research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treatment-resistant depression appears promising, but concerns have been raised about the decisional capacity of severely depressed patients and their potential misconceptions about the research.

We used a computational model to calculate the distribution of electric potential induced by DBS and study the effect of stimulation on the spiking activity of a subthalamic nucleus (STN) projection neuron. We previously showed that such a model can reveal detailed spatial effects of stimulation in the vicinity of the electrode. However, this multi-compartmental STN neuron model can fire in either a burst or tonic mode and, in this study, we hypothesized that the firing mode of the cell will have a major impact on the DBS-induced effects. Our simulations showed that the bursting model exhibits behaviour observed in studies of high-frequency stimulation of STN neurons, such as the presence of a silent period at stimulation offset and frequency-dependent stimulation effects. We validated the model by simulating the clinical parameter settings used for a Parkinsonian patient and showed, in a patient-specific anatomical model, that the region of affected tissue is consistent with clinical observations of the optimal DBS site.

We set out to begin to address the hypothesis that a mixture of responses in the basal ganglia output nuclei, combining regularized firing and inhibition, is a key contributor to the effectiveness of STN DBS. We used our computational model of the complete basal ganglia circuit to show how such a mixture of responses in basal ganglia output naturally arises from the network effects of STN DBS. We replicated the diversification of responses recorded in a primate STN DBS study to show that the model's predicted mixture of responses is consistent with therapeutic STN DBS.

CN is a cylinder-shaped structure that lies bilaterally in the brainstem and extends nearly 4mm in the rostrocaudal direction. The forelimb is represented along the rostrocaudal extent. CN contains three zones; the rostral and caudal zones receive input largely from deep muscle and joint receptors and a middle zone, in the vicinity of the obex, receives input primarily from cutaneous receptors in the skin. The middle zone is somatotopically organized with the glabrous digits represented centrally, bordered on the medial side by ulnar wrist, ulnar forearm, and posterior upper arm representations; on the lateral side by radial wrist, radial forearm, and anterior upper arm representations; and on dorsal side by the dorsal digits and dorsal hand. The middle zone also contains well-defined CO-filled glomerular structures, called barrelettes, which are located within a homogenously stained field. The barrelettes are associated with the representation of the glabrous digits, with D5 represented most dorsal followed sequentially in a ventral-to-lateral direction by the representation of D4, D3, D2, and D1. The digit representations are topographically organized with the distal digit surface represented laterally with respect to the more medially lying proximal digit surface.

To begin addressing this key safety issue, we tested the therapeutic potential of resveratrol in reducing brain trauma caused by DBS-like surgery. Microinfusion of resveratrol (10 \u03bcM) directly applied to the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) of the rat brain significantly minimized the formation of astrocytic gliosis in response to a 27-G precision-glide cannula implant. The therapeutic effects of resveratrol extended to the \"kill zone\", a boundary zone of about 100 \u03bcm comprising the cannula implant and surrounding neurons. We also found that resveratrol not only provided almost complete protection from mechanical injury to the brain, but that it also prevented undesirable motor deficits often seen in animals with lesions to the STN. Lastly, continuous infusion of resveratrol over a 4-week period led to the inhibition of pro-apoptotic, neurodegenerative and cell division cycle genes that may be associated with a reduction in astrocytic gliosis and glial scar formation within the STN. Taken together, these data suggest that application of resveratrol to the brain is an effective adjunct surgical procedure for minimizing acute neuronal injury when electrodes are implanted directly into the STN.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "79 Suppl 2", "title": "Managing the patient with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22367987", "authors": ["Galvez-Jimenez, N"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine", "abstract": "We report a 39-year-old man with bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

Microdialysis experiments indicated that STN-DBS decreased 5-HT release in the dorsolateral caudate-putamen, an area implicated in the etiology of HAL-induced VCMs. DBS applied to the EPN also suppressed VCMs but did not alter 5-HT release or raphe neuron activation. While these findings suggested a role for decreased 5-HT release in the mechanisms of STN DBS, further microdialysis experiments showed that when the 5-HT lowering effects of STN DBS were prevented by pretreatment with fluoxetine or fenfluramine, the ability of DBS to suppress VCMs remained unaltered.

Other 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were treated with chronic high doses of L-DOPA for ten days, to induce abnormal involuntary movements. The 6-OHDA lesion regulated NR2B only in the SNr, where the activation of NR2B was observed (as assessed by phosphorylation of the Tyr1472 residue). Both STN-HFS and L-DOPA dyskinesiogenic treatments induced NR2B activation in the STN and EP, but only L-DOPA triggered NR2B hyperphosphorylation in the striatum. Finally, the use of CP-101,606 exacerbated L-DOPA-induced motor behavior and associated NR2B hyperphosphorylation in the striatum, STN and EP. Thus, NR2B activation in basal ganglia structures is correlated with dyskinesia.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Methylphenidate for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "2514009", "authors": ["Bourne, SK", "Eckhardt, CA", "Sheth, SA", "Eskandar, EN"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) directly modulates the basal ganglia (BG), but how such stimulation impacts the cortex upstream is largely unknown. There is evidence of cortical activation in 6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA)-lesioned rodents and facilitation of motor evoked potentials in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, but the impact of the DBS settings on the cortical activity in normal vs. Parkinsonian conditions is still debated. We use point process models to analyze non-stationary activation patterns and inter-neuronal dependencies in the motor and sensory cortices of two non-human primates during STN DBS. These features are enhanced after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which causes a consistent PD-like motor impairment, while high-frequency (HF) DBS (i.e., \u2265100 Hz) strongly reduces the short-term patterns (period: 3-7 ms) both before and after MPTP treatment, and elicits a short-latency post-stimulus activation. Low-frequency DBS (i.e., \u226450 Hz), instead, has negligible effects on the non-stationary features. Finally, by using tools from the information theory [i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and information rate (IR)], we show that the predictive power of these models is dependent on the DBS settings, i.e., the probability of spiking of the cortical neurons (which is captured by the point process models) is significantly conditioned on the timely delivery of the DBS input. This dependency increases with the DBS frequency and is significantly larger for high- vs. low-frequency DBS. Overall, the selective suppression of non-stationary features and the increased modulation of the spike probability suggest that HF STN DBS enhances the neuronal activation in motor and sensory cortices, presumably because of reinforcement mechanisms, which perhaps involve the overlap between feedback antidromic and feed-forward orthodromic responses along the BG-thalamo-cortical loop.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "Unilateral caudal zona incerta deep brain stimulation for Parkinsonian tremor.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1972680", "authors": ["Rodriguez-Oroz, MC"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie", "abstract": "The brain is a densely interconnected network that relies on populations of neurons within and across multiple nuclei to code for features leading to perception and action. However, the neurophysiology field is still dominated by the characterization of individual neurons, rather than simultaneous recordings across multiple regions, without consistent spatial reconstruction of their locations for comparisons across studies. There are sophisticated histological and imaging techniques for performing brain reconstructions. However, what is needed is a method that is relatively easy and inexpensive to implement in a typical neurophysiology lab and provides consistent identification of electrode locations to make it widely used for pooling data across studies and research groups. This paper presents our initial development of such an approach for reconstructing electrode tracks and site locations within the guinea pig inferior colliculus (IC) to identify its functional organization for frequency coding relevant for a new auditory midbrain implant (AMI). Encouragingly, the spatial error associated with different individuals reconstructing electrode tracks for the same midbrain was less than 65 \u03bcm, corresponding to an error of ~1.5% relative to the entire IC structure (~4-5 mm diameter sphere). Furthermore, the reconstructed frequency laminae of the IC were consistently aligned across three sampled midbrains, demonstrating the ability to use our method to combine location data across animals. Hopefully, through further improvements in our reconstruction method, it can be used as a standard protocol across neurophysiology labs to characterize neural data not only within the IC but also within other brain regions to help bridge the gap between cellular activity and network function. Clinically, correlating function with location within and across multiple brain regions can guide optimal placement of electrodes for the growing field of neural prosthetics.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "307", "title": "[Therapy of tic disorders].", "issue": "21", "pmid": "16630057", "authors": ["Blomstedt, P", "Fytagoridis, A", "\u00c5str\u00f6m, M", "Linder, J", "Forsgren, L", "Hariz, MI"], "year": "2012", "journal": "JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association", "abstract": "Gait and balance disorders represent a major therapeutic challenge in Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms respond poorly to dopaminergic treatments, except in the early phase of the disease. Currently, no other treatment is particularly efficient and rehabilitation appears to be the most effective approach. Since these gait and balance deficits are resistant to dopaminergic drugs, their occurrence could be related to the development of extradopaminergic lesions in PD patients. We provide a comprehensive description of the clinical features of gait and balance disorders in PD. We also highlight the brain networks involved in gait and balance control in animals and humans with a particular focus on the relevant structures in the context of PD, such as the mesencephalic locomotor region. We also review other neuronal systems that may be involved in the physiopathology of gait and balance disorders in PD (noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems, cerebellum and cortex). In addition, we review recent evidence regarding functional neurosurgery for gait disorders in PD and propose new directions for future therapeutic research.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Treatment of Parkinson disease: a 64-year-old man with motor complications of advanced Parkinson disease.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "16359844", "authors": ["Roessner, V", "Schoenefeld, K", "Buse, J", "Wanderer, S", "Rothenberger, A"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "abstract": "Timing is central to all motor behavior, especially repetitive or rhythmic movements. Such complex programs are underpinned by a network of motor structures, including the cerebellum, motor cortex, and basal ganglia. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are impaired in some aspects of timing behavior, presumably as a result of the disruption to basal ganglia function. However, direct evidence that this deficit is specifically due to basal ganglia dysfunction is limited. Here, we sought to further understand the role of the basal ganglia in motor timing by studying PD patients with implanted subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrodes. Patients performed a synchronization-continuation tapping task at 500 ms and 2000 ms intervals both off and on therapeutic high frequency stimulation of the STN. Our results show that the mean tap interval was not affected by STN stimulation. However, in the un-stimulated state variability of tapping was abnormally high relative to controls, and this deficit was significantly improved, even normalized, with stimulation. Moreover, when partitioning the variance into central and peripheral motor components according to the Wing and Kristofferson model (1973), a selective reduction of central, but not motor, variance was revealed. The effect of stimulation on central variance was dependent on off-stimulation performance. These results demonstrate that STN stimulation can improve rhythmic movement performance in PD through an effect on central timing. Our experimental approach strongly implicates the STN, and more generally the basal ganglia, in the control of timing stability.", "pages": "988-93"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Behavioral and EEG effects of GABAergic manipulation of the nigro-tectal pathway in the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR) strain II: an EEG wavelet analysis and retrograde neuronal tracer approach.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16885224", "authors": ["Tarsy, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Seminars in pediatric neurology", "abstract": "Vocal tremor is a common, troublesome disorder that is difficult to treat.
