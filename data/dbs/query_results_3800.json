This type of dyskinesias may appear in patients even in the prolonged absence of antiparkinson medication and be aggravated by levodopa. Therefore, pharmacological therapeutic approaches in these patients are limited. Here we report two patients with bilateral fetal nigral grafts in the caudate and putamen subjected to deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical assessment was performed according to UPDRS and the clinical dyskinesia rating scale. In both patients, we found significant improvement in OFF-period symptoms as well as levodopa-induced dyskinesias. However, only GPi-DBS led to a significant reduction of OFF-period dyskinesias whereas STN-DBS did not influence dyskinesias unrelated to external dopaminergic application.

Among the nonmotor complications, dementia is the most important. Approximately 40% of PD patients are affected by cognitive impairment. Remarkably, in addition to age, dementia is an independent predictor of mortality, whereas age at onset of PD and severity of neurological symptoms are not. In this review, I summarize the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of the PD cognitive impairment in relation to the therapies presently accessible and those that could become strategic in the near future. It is hypothesized that patients with PD show two components of cognitive dysfunction (CD): a generalized profile of subcortical dementia (PDsCD), and an overlapped pattern suggesting specific prefrontal damage with CD (PDpFCD). PDsCD is associated with structural neocortical/subcortical changes in the brain (in frontal, parietal, limbic, and temporal lobes, as well as in midbrain structures). In PDpFCD cognitive deficits comprise impairments in neuropsychological tests sensitive for frontal lobe function (discrete elements of episodic and working memory for instance), which are considered to be the consequence of dysfunction in neuronal loops connecting the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Drugs reviewed for targeting PDsCD include: cholinesterase inhibitors, agents with mixed cholinergic and dopaminergic properties, antiglutamatergic drugs, mixed antiglutamatergic/dopaminergic agents; antioxidants and enhancers of mitochondrial functions, and anti-COX-2, as well as other anti-inflammatory mediators. Preliminary studies with vehicles that may target PDpFCD include piribedil, tolcapone, amantadine, and farampator. Additional agents (citicoline and neuroimmuniphilines, among others) will be outlined. A brief overview on neuroprotection and promising new biological advances in PD (deep brain stimulation, stem cells, gene therapy) also will be summarized.", "pages": "565-7"}, {"volume": "233", "title": "Current management of the cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: how far have we come?", "issue": "8", "pmid": "18536037", "authors": ["Vale, S"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "abstract": "Although vasospasm usually occurs in the presence of normal coronary arteries, its clinical course is indistinguishable from coronary ischaemia, and actual myocardial damage frequently occurs, as demonstrated by ECG changes and troponin rises seen in such cases.

To investigate the mechanisms involved, we analyzed changes in local field potentials from the subthalamic area (STN-LFPs) recorded through the deep brain macroelectrode during monopolar DBS of the subthalamic nucleus area (STN-DBS) in a group of eight patients (16 nuclei) with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Monopolar STN-DBS was delivered through contact 1 and differential LFP recordings were acquired between contacts 0 and 2. The stimulating contact was 0.5 mm away from each recording contact. The power spectral analysis of STN-LFPs showed that during ongoing STN-DBS whereas the power of beta oscillations (8-20 Hz) and high beta oscillations (21-40 Hz) remained unchanged, the power of low-frequency oscillations (1-7 Hz) significantly increased (baseline=0.37+/-0.22; during DBS=7.07+/-15.10, p=0.0003). Despite comparable low-frequency baseline power with and without levodopa, the increase in low-frequency oscillations during STN-DBS was over boosted by pretreatment with levodopa. The low-frequency power increase in STN-LFPs during ongoing STN-DBS could reflect changes induced at basal ganglia network level similar to those elicited by levodopa. In addition, the correlation between the heart beat and the low-frequency oscillations suggests that part of the low-frequency power increase during STN-DBS arises from polarization phenomena around the stimulating electrode.

Important advances have been made in the last decade, but unfortunately a number of the motor symptoms of late-stage PD remain poorly treated, and while currently available therapies address the symptoms of the disease, they fail to alter the course of the disease itself. This has spurred basic and clinical exploration on a number of fronts. Several centers have examined novel stimulation targets to treat refractory symptoms of gait difficulty and axial imbalance.

This causes resting tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, bradykinesia, and loss of postural reflexes. Most current treatments for Parkinson's disease aim to restore striatal dopamine signaling by increasing the supply of dopamine with oral levodopa (L-dopa), stimulating dopamine receptors directly using dopamine agonists, or inhibiting the reuptake of endogenous dopamine. L-dopa is standard therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease. However, with continued treatment and disease progression, the response to oral dopaminergic drugs becomes unstable and motor fluctuations emerge, including off periods and dyskinesia. Direct duodenal-administered infusible L-dopa/carbidopa is effective for the management of refractory motor fluctuations in some patient populations.

Given ocular stability, low-frequency activity sustained by some neurons within the intermediate and deep superior colliculus (dSC) is assumed to be separated from motor output. However, the dSC is an orienting structure and the influence of low-frequency dSC activity at other effectors remains untested. We studied this by simultaneously recording activity from saccade-related dSC neurons and electromyographic (EMG) activity from neck muscles that turn the head. Monkeys performed a gap-saccade paradigm with varying levels of reward expectancy. Despite head restraint and even for relatively small target eccentricities (<or=10 degrees ), increasing reward expectancy for a given target increased the level of low-frequency activity on dSC neurons encoding saccades to the rewarded target and increased the recruitment of a neck muscle synergy that would turn the head toward the target. The magnitude of neck muscle recruitment correlated positively on a trial-by-trial basis with the level of low-frequency dSC activity, and such correlations were optimized when neck muscle activity was shifted about 20 ms later to account for delays in the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. Further, dSC activity discriminated about the side of target presentation approximately 11 ms earlier than neck EMG activity. Considered alongside neck EMG responses evoked causally by SC stimulation, our results are consistent with low-frequency dSC activity recruiting a head-turning synergy. Our results support a brain stem circuit wherein the magnitude of neck muscle recruitment reflects the difference in comparative low-frequency activation across both dSCs, perhaps because of mutually inhibitory interactions within downstream head premotor circuits.", "pages": "565-7"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "Vagus rules still apply.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "15519857", "authors": ["McLoughlin, DM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Psychological medicine", "abstract": "Deep brain subthalamic stimulation provides symptomatic relief to patients with Parkinson's disease.

These centers used comparable patient selection criteria and surgical targeting. Targeting, but not selection, evolved during this period. Here, we present combined long-term results of those studies, which reveal clinically significant symptom reductions and functional improvement in about two-thirds of patients. DBS was well tolerated overall and adverse effects were overwhelmingly transient. Results generally improved for patients implanted more recently, suggesting a 'learning curve' both within and across centers. This is well known from the development of DBS for movement disorders. The main factor accounting for these gains appears to be the refinement of the implantation site. Initially, an anterior-posterior location based on anterior capsulotomy lesions was used. In an attempt to improve results, more posterior sites were investigated resulting in the current target, at the junction of the anterior capsule, anterior commissure and posterior ventral striatum.

In addition, it is now widely acknowledged that damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), especially the right side, can result in impaired recognition of facial emotions (RFE). In this context, we hypothesized that this reduced recognition of fear is correlated with modifications in the cerebral glucose metabolism of the right OFC.

This region of the brain is unfamiliar territory to most functional neurosurgeons. This paper reviews the anatomy of the human PPN and describes novel, clinically relevant methods for the atlas-based and MRI-based localization of the nucleus. These two methods of PPN localization are evaluated and compared on stereotactic MRI data acquired from a diverse group of 12 patients undergoing implantation of deep brain electrodes at sites other than the PPN. Atlas-based coordinates of the rostral and caudal PPN poles in relation to fourth ventricular landmarks were established by amalgamating information sourced from two published human brain atlases. These landmarks were identified on acquired T1 images and atlas-derived coordinates used to plot the predicted PPN location on all 24 sides. Images acquired using a specifically modified, proton-density MRI protocol were available for each patient and were spatially fused to the T1 images. This widely available and rapid protocol provided excellent definition between gray and white matter within the region of interest. Together with an understanding of the regional anatomy, direct localization of the PPN was possible on all 24 sides. The coordinates for each directly localized nucleus were measured in relation to third and fourth ventricular landmarks. The mean (SD) of the directly localized PPN midpoints was 6.4 mm (0.5) lateral, 3.5 mm (1.0) posterior and 11.4 mm (1.2) caudal to the posterior commissure in the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. For the directly localized nucleus, there was similar concordance for the rostral pole of the PPN in relation to third and fourth ventricular landmarks (P>0.05). For the caudal PPN pole, fourth ventricular landmarks provided greater concordance with reference to the anteroposterior coordinate (P<0.001). There was a significant difference between localization of the PPN poles as predicted by atlas-based coordinates and direct MRI localization. This difference affected mainly the rostrocaudal coordinates; the mean lateral and anteroposterior coordinates of the directly localized PPN poles were within 0.5 mm of the atlas-based predicted values. Our findings provide simple, rapid and precise methods that are of clinical relevance to the atlas-based and direct stereotactic localization of the human PPN. Direct MRI localization may allow greater individual accuracy than that afforded by atlas-based coordinates when localizing the human PPN and may be relevant to groups evaluating the clinical role of PPN DBS.", "pages": "565-7"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "Location of active contacts in patients with primary dystonia treated with globus pallidus deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "3 Suppl 1", "pmid": "12662250", "authors": ["Hamani, C", "Moro, E", "Zadikoff, C", "Poon, YY", "Lozano, AM"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Although magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) have been available for decades, their relative merits are still debated.

As a treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus was introduced in 1987 to treat tremor, and was applied in 1993 to the subthalamic nucleus. Now high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has become a surgical therapy of choice. Another surgical treatment is a cell replacement therapy. Transplantation of fetal dopaminergic (DA) neurons can produce symptomatic relief, however, the technical and ethical difficulties in obtaining sufficient and appropriate donor fetal brain tissue have limited the application of this therapy. Then, neural precursor cells and embryonic stem (ES) cells are expected to be candidates of potential donor cells for transplantation. We induced DA neurons from monkey ES cells, and analyzed the effect of transplantation of the DA neurons into MPTP-treated monkeys as a primate model of Parkinson's disease. Behavioral studies and functional imaging revealed that the transplanted cells functioned as DA neurons, attenuating the MPTP-induced neurological symptoms. DA neurons have also been generated from several human ES cell lines. Furthermore, functional recovery of rat PD models after transplantation was observed. One of the major problems in ES cell transplantation is tumor formation, which is caused by a small fraction of undifferentiated ES cells in the graft. So, it is essential for undifferentiated ES cells to be eliminated from the graft in order for transplantation to be feasible.

Four contact strips were used for cerebellar and functional region neuromodulation, and DBS-type depth electrodes were stereotactically implanted for CM-pf and anterior nuclei of the thalamus and hippocampal neuromodulation. Electric stimulation was cyclic in almost all trials, using low frequency (10-40 Hz) for excitation and high frequency (60-185 Hz) for inhibition. Seizure frequency reduction was variable, depending on the neuromodulation site and patient selection, although seizure duration decreased in most patients. Cerebellar neuromodulation was followed by a 78% reduction in tonic and tonic-clonic seizures, CM-pf neuromodulation by an 83% reduction in tonic-clonic seizures and atypical absence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with a 17.2% seizure-free and drug-free patient rate. Hippocampal neuromodulation was followed by a 73% reduction in partial complex seizures, with a 33% seizure-free patient rate. Anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus was followed by a 63% reduction in tonic-clonic, tonic and atonic seizures. Several prognostic factors were identified in order to improve future results. There was no mortality and morbidity was limited to skin erosion at the neurostimulator site. Seizure reduction was associated with improved neuropsychological performance and better quality of life. Neuromodulation is safe and effective for the treatment of epileptic seizures of various origins. Several targets may be associated in a single patient, especially when bilateral hippocampal seizure foci are present.", "pages": "565-7"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Thalamic Vo-complex vs pallidal deep brain stimulation for focal hand dystonia.", "issue": "16 Pt 2", "pmid": "14645885", "authors": ["Goto, S", "Shimazu, H", "Matsuzaki, K", "Tamura, T", "Murase, N", "Nagahiro, S", "Kaji, R"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Review of available evidence of the mechanisms of action underlying the anticonvulsant effect of current applied to various CNS structures.", "pages": "565-7"}, {"volume": "70", "title": "Psychogenic tremor occurring after deep brain stimulation surgery for essential tremor.", "issue": "16 Pt 2", "pmid": "14729131", "authors": ["McKeon, A", "Ahlskog, JE", "Matsumoto, JY"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Studies were conducted from observations of patients with drug-resistant seizures and treated with neuromodulation.
