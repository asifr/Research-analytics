In this study we explored static and dynamic activation patterns in the basal ganglia (BG) during high-frequency macro-stimulation of the STN. Extracellular multi-electrode recordings were performed in primates rendered parkinsonian using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Recordings were preformed simultaneously in the STN and the globus pallidus externus and internus. Single units were recorded preceding and during the stimulation. During the stimulation, STN mean firing rate dropped significantly, while pallidal mean firing rates did not change significantly. The vast majority of neurons across all three nuclei displayed stimulation driven modulations, which were stereotypic within each nucleus but differed across nuclei. The predominant response pattern of STN neurons was somatic inhibition. However, most pallidal neurons demonstrated synaptic activation patterns. A minority of neurons across all nuclei displayed axonal activation. Temporal dynamics were observed in the response to stimulation over the first 10 seconds in the STN and over the first 30 seconds in the pallidum. In both pallidal segments, the synaptic activation response patterns underwent delay and decay of the magnitude of the peak response due to short term synaptic depression. We suggest that during STN macro-stimulation the STN goes through a functional ablation as its upper bound on information transmission drops significantly. This notion is further supported by the evident dissociation between the stimulation driven pre-synaptic STN somatic inhibition and the post-synaptic axonal activation of its downstream targets. Thus, BG output maintains its firing rate while losing the deleterious effect of the STN.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to track changes in short-latency intracortical inhibition, a measure of excitability of GABA(A) -ergic corticocortical connections and long-term potentiation-like synaptic plasticity (as a response to paired associative stimulation). Deep brain stimulation remained on for the duration of the study. Prior to surgery, inhibition was reduced and plasticity increased in patients compared with healthy controls. Following surgery and commencement of deep brain stimulation, short-latency intracortical inhibition increased toward normal levels over the following months with the same monotonic time course as the patients' clinical benefit. In contrast, synaptic plasticity changed rapidly, following a nonmonotonic time course: it was absent early (1 month) after surgery, and then over the following months increased toward levels observed in healthy individuals. We postulate that before surgery preexisting high levels of plasticity form strong memories of dystonic movement patterns. When deep brain stimulation is turned on, it disrupts abnormal basal ganglia signals, resulting in the absent response to paired associative stimulation at 1 month.

The looming responses were characterized by distinct firing patterns, in which the neuronal discharge steadily increased as the object was approaching, and peaked approximately at the time of collision (rho cell) or some time earlier (eta cell).

The nearly identical constellation of stimulation parameters raises the question of a unique mechanism of action of this therapeutic option. The identification of a single HFS mechanism may help to optimize the HFS technology by targeting this single mechanism. Experimentally, only axonal membranes are targets of HFS, but not other membranes of neurons or glial cells. Within all HFS target regions, axons of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons are present and play roles in all clinical syndromes treated successfully with HFS. Therefore, glutamatergic or GABAergic fibres are likely candidates as mediators of a unique HFS mode of action. The selective involvement of another neuronal fibre type (e.g. monoaminergic, cholinergic, etc.) in the HFS mode of action is highly unlikely since the regional and syndromal dissimilarity of the clinical HFS applications precludes the assumption of such a fibre type as primary HFS site of action. Our recent experimental finding that HFS of human neocortical slices induces the action potential-mediated release of GABA, but not of glutamate, simplifies the possibilities to explain the HFS mode of action, as the explanation now may concentrate on GABAergic axons only. Thus, we are analysing, on the basis of the pathophysiological grounds of the various syndromes treated with deep brain stimulation, whether a selective GABA release is a collective explanation of the mode of action of HFS.

Excessive estrogen during menstruation directly stimulate estrogen receptor alpha thickly populated in trigeminal ganglia and periaqueductal gray which manifest as menstrual migraine. In contrast increased progesterone during pregnancy evokes progesterone receptors A/B, which coexist with ERs, providing complete remission from migraine episodes. Moreover, estrogen also increases nociception through extracellularly signal-regulated kinase (ERK) stimulation and down-regulating antinociceptive GABA, IL-R1 and Zn-fingers. Hormones may provoke migraine indirectly by disrupting mineral homeostasis. Estrogen enhances the absorption and half-life of copper which in turn inhibits the absorption of zinc. Zinc is required for the synthesis of melatonin and CoQ10 essential for growing women. Excess of copper exacerbates the deficiency of zinc, melatonin and CoQ10 typically low in migraineurs. Melatonin is an antioxidant, free radical scavenger and activates antioxidant enzymes like CuZn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (a Se-enzyme) and glutathione reductase. Zinc deficiency reduces activity of CuZn-SOD. Magnesium and vitamin B6 modulates the level of NO in the cell, both of which are deficient in migraineurs. Magnesium is essential for the removal of trapped NO from within the cell which does not occur under low magnesium levels, which reacts with superoxide generating dangerous peroxynitrite. Iron stimulates nitric oxide synthase producing more NO which is inhibited by zinc, thus, antagonizing peroxynitrite generation. Female hormones lowers magnesium but increase calcium levels which enhance migraine ubiquitousness. Accumulation of copper and iron in deep areas of brain and peripheral nerves typically catalyses the oxidation of catecholamines and generate free radicals involved in lipid-peroxidation, demyelination, denudation of axons and neurodegeneration in specific areas exposing hyperalgesic axons provoking Classical migraine. Furthermore, zinc is an essential component of Zn-fingers (Krox20 and Krox24) which play a pivotal role in the differentiation of Schwann cells-the mainstay for the myelination/remyelination of peripheral nerves.

In our previous study, the clinical transitions from OFF- to ON-state were not correlated with significant changes of GABA content inside GPi or substantia nigra reticulata. Here, biochemical effects of STN-DBS have been assessed in putamen (PUT), internal pallidus (GPi), and inside the antero-ventral thalamus (VA), the key station receiving pallidothalamic fibers. In 10 advanced PD patients undergoing surgery, microdialysis samples were collected before and during STN-DBS. cGMP, an index of glutamatergic transmission, was measured in GPi and PUT by radioimmunoassay, whereas GABA from VA was measured by HPLC. During clinically effective STN-DBS, we found a significant decrease in GABA extracellular concentrations in VA (-30%). Simultaneously, cGMP extracellular concentrations were enhanced in PUT (+200%) and GPi (+481%). These findings support a thalamic dis-inhibition, in turn re-establishing a more physiological corticostriatal transmission, as the source of motor improvement. They indirectly confirm the relevance of patterning (instead of mere changes of excitability) and suggest that a rigid interpretation of the standard model, at least when it indicates the hyperactive indirect pathway as key feature of hypokinetic signs, is unlikely to be correct.

In a subset of relatively younger patients with relatively shorter disease duration, the effects of DBS appeared to spread to more cognitive regions of the STN, benefiting loops that connect the caudate to various prefrontal areas importantfor outcome evaluation.

Currently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is being investigated as an experimental therapy for treatment-refractory OCD. This review focuses on the efficacy and adverse events of all published DBS targets for OCD: anterior limb of the internal capsule, ventral striatum/ventral capsule, nucleus accumbens, nucleus subthalamicus, and inferior thalamic peduncle. Small studies with various designs indicate an overall average Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decrease ranging from 6.8 to 31 points. The average overall responder rate is \u00b150%. The frequency of adverse events seems to be limited. Larger prospective studies including neuroimaging are needed to estimate adequately the true potential of DBS in treatment of OCD and to elucidate its underlying mechanism of action and optimal brain target.

The striatal area contributes to response learning and procedural memory. Therefore, we investigated the effect of striatal HFS application on procedural/declarative-like memory in rats. All rats were trained in a flooded Double-H maze for three days (4 trials/day) to swim to an escape platform hidden at a constant location. The starting place was the same for all trials. After each training session, HFS of the left dorsal striatum was performed over 4h in alternating 20 min periods (during rest time, 10a.m. to 3p.m.). Nineteen hours after the last HFS and right after a probe trial assessing the rats' strategy (procedural vs. declarative-like memory-based choice), animals were sacrificed and the dorsal striatum was quickly removed. Neurotransmitter levels were measured by HPLC. Stimulated rats did not differ from sham-operated and control rats in acquisition performance, but exhibited altered behavior during the probe trial (procedural memory responses being less frequent than in controls). In stimulated rats, GABA levels were significantly increased in the dorsal striatum on both sides. We suggest that HFS of the dorsal striatum does not alter learning behavior in rats but influences the strategy by which the rats solve the task. Given that the HFS-induced increase of GABA levels was found 19 h after stimulation, it can be assumed that HFS has consequences lasting for several hours and which are functionally significant at a behavioral level, at least under our stimulation (frequency, timing, location, side and strength of stimulation) and testing conditions.", "pages": "9"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Automatic spike sorting for extracellular electrophysiological recording using unsupervised single linkage clustering based on grey relational analysis.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8552123", "authors": ["Lai, HY", "Chen, YY", "Lin, SH", "Lo, YC", "Tsang, S", "Chen, SY", "Zhao, WT", "Chao, WH", "Chang, YC", "Wu, R", "Shih, YY", "Tsai, ST", "Jaw, FS"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "The complication of hardware infection related to deep brain stimulator implantation (or revision) varies between 0 and 15.2% in the literature.

A prospective cohort of 38 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation or internal pulse generator (IPG) replacement and receiving perioperative vancomycin (including intravenous gentamicin on induction) and pouch-installed gentamicin, was compared to a historical cohort of 35 patients receiving perioperative cefuroxime in the same unit.

Their prevalence is difficult to determine. In our experience 80-90% of all dystonias are primary. About 20-30% of those have a genetic background; 10-20% are secondary, with tardive dystonia and dystonia in cerebral palsy being the most common forms. If dystonia in spastic conditions is accepted as secondary dystonia, this is the most common form of all dystonia. In primary dystonias, the dystonic movements are the only symptoms. In secondary dystonias, dystonic movements result from exogenous processes directly or indirectly affecting brain parenchyma. They may be caused by focal and diffuse brain damage, drugs, chemical agents, physical interactions with the central nervous system, and indirect central nervous system effects. Dystonia-plus syndromes describe brain parenchyma processes producing predominantly dystonia together with other movement disorders. They include dopa-responsive dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia. Heredodegenerative dystonias are dystonic movements occurring in the context of other heredodegenerative disorders. They may be caused by impaired energy metabolism, impaired systemic metabolism, storage of noxious substances, oligonucleotid repeats and other processes. Pseudodystonias mimic dystonia and include psychogenic dystonia and various orthopedic, ophthalmologic, vestibular, and traumatic conditions. Unusual manifestations, unusual age of onset, suspect family history, suspect medical history, and additional signs may indicate nonprimary dystonia. If they are suspected, etiological clarification becomes necessary. Unfortunately, potential etiologies are legion. Diagnostic algorithms can be helpful. Treatment of nonprimary dystonias, with few exceptions, does not differ from treatment of primary dystonias. The most effective treatment for focal and segmental dystonias is local botulinum toxin injections. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is effective for generalized dystonia. Antidystonic drugs, including anticholinergics, tetrabenazine, clozapine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, are less effective and often produce adverse effects. Dopamine is extremely effective in dopa-responsive dystonia. The Bertrand procedure can be effective in cervical dystonia. Other peripheral surgery, including myotomy, myectomy, neurotomy, rhizotomy, ramizectomy, and accessory nerve neurolysis, has largely been abandoned. Central surgery other than deep brain stimulation is obsolete. Adjuvant therapies, including orthoses, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, behavioral therapy, social support, and support groups, may be helpful.

Animal models of myoclonus include DDT and posthypoxic myoclonus in the rat. 5-Hydrotryptophan, clonazepam, and valproic acid suppress myoclonus induced by posthypoxia. The diagnostic evaluation of myoclonus is complex and involves an extensive work-up including basic electrolytes, glucose, renal and hepatic function tests, paraneoplastic antibodies, drug and toxicology screens, thyroid antibody and function studies, neurophysiology testing, imaging, and tests for malabsorption disorders, assays for enzyme deficiencies, tissue biopsy, copper studies, alpha-fetoprotein, cytogenetic analysis, radiosensitivity DNA synthesis, genetic testing for inherited disorders, and mitochondrial function studies. Treatment of myoclonus is targeted to the underlying disorder. If myoclonus physiology cannot be demonstrated, treatment should be aimed at the common pattern of symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, treatment could be directed empirically at cortical myoclonus as the most common physiology. In cortical myoclonus, the most effective drugs are sodium valproic acid, clonazepam, levetiracetam, and piracetam. For cortical-subcortical myoclonus, valproic acid is the drug of choice. Here, lamotrigine can be used either alone or in combination with valproic acid. Ethosuximide, levetiracetam, or zonisamide can also be used as adjunct therapy with valproic acid. A ketogenic diet can be considered if everything else fails. Subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus may respond to clonazepam and deep-brain stimulation. Rituximab, adrenocorticotropic hormone, high-dose dexamethasone pulse, or plasmapheresis have been reported to improve opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome.

This particular therapy allows to contrast actively the pathological activity of various Deep Brain structures, responsible for the well known PD symptoms. This technique, frequently joined to dopaminergic drugs administration, replaces the surgical interventions implemented to contrast the activity of specific brain nuclei, called Basal Ganglia (BG). This clinical protocol gave the possibility to analyse and inspect signals measured from the electrodes implanted into the deep brain regions. The analysis of these signals led to the possibility to study the PD as a specific case of dynamical synchronization in biological neural networks, with the advantage to apply the theoretical analysis developed in such scientific field to find efficient treatments to face with this important disease. Experimental results in fact show that the PD neurological diseases are characterized by a pathological signal synchronization in BG. Parkinsonian tremor, for example, is ascribed to be caused by neuron populations of the Thalamic and Striatal structures that undergo an abnormal synchronization. On the contrary, in normal conditions, the activity of the same neuron populations do not appear to be correlated and synchronized.", "pages": "9"}]
