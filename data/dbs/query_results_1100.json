Based on this evidence, we have made strong recommendations for the use of habit reversal therapy and exposure and response prevention, preferably embedded within a supportive, psychoeducational program, and with the option to combine either of these approaches with pharmacotherapy. Although evidence exists for the efficacy of DBS, the quality of this evidence is poor and the risks and burdens of the procedure are finely balanced with the perceived benefits. Our recommendation is that this intervention continues to be considered an experimental treatment for severe, medically refractory tics that have imposed severe limitations on quality of life. We recommend that the procedure should only be performed within the context of research studies and by physicians expert in DBS programming and in the management of tics. There is no evidence to support the use of TMS in the treatment of tics.

The clinical application of this new therapy is controversial and it is unknown if bilateral stimulation is more effective than unilateral.

Under experimental conditions, while OFF medication, Parkinsonian patients with severe gait freezing implanted with pedunculopontine nucleus stimulators below the pontomesencephalic junction were assessed during three conditions; off stimulation, unilateral stimulation and bilateral stimulation. Results were compared to Parkinsonian patients without gait freezing matched for disease severity and healthy controls. Pedunculopontine nucleus stimulation improved objective measures of gait freezing, with bilateral stimulation more effective than unilateral. During unconstrained walking, Parkinsonian patients who experience gait freezing had reduced step length and increased step length variability compared to patients without gait freezing; however, these deficits were unchanged by pedunculopontine nucleus stimulation. Chronic pedunculopontine nucleus stimulation improved Freezing of Gait Questionnaire scores, reflecting a reduction of the freezing encountered in patients' usual environments and medication states.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is one of the standard surgical treatments for advanced Parkinson's disease. However, it has been difficult to accurately localize the stimulated contact area of the electrode in the subthalamic nucleus and its adjacent structures using a two-dimensional atlas. The goal of this study is to verify the real and detailed localization of stimulated contact of the DBS electrode therapeutically inserted into the STN and its adjacent structures using a novel computed three-dimensional atlas built by a personal computer. Method. A three-dimensional atlas of the STN and its adjacent structures (3D-Subthalamus atlas) was elaborated on the basis of sagittal slices from the Schaltenbrand and Wahren stereotactic atlas on a personal computer utilizing a commercial software. The electrode inserted into the STN and its adjacent structures was superimposed on our 3D-Subthalamus atlas based on intraoperative third ventriculography in 11 cases. Findings. Accurate localization of the DBS electrode was identified using the 3D-Subthalamus atlas, and its clinical efficacy of the electrode stimulation was investigated in all 11 cases. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that the 3D-Subthalamus atlas is a useful tool for understanding the morphology of deep brain structures and for the precise anatomical position findings of the stimulated contact of a DBS electrode. The clinical analysis using the 3D atlas supports the contention that the stimulation of structures adjacent to the STN, particularly the zona incerta or the field of Forel H, is as effective as the stimulation of the STN itself for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "1324-32"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Eye movement impairments in Parkinson's disease: possible role of extradopaminergic mechanisms.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22398000", "authors": ["Pinkhardt, EH", "J\u00fcrgens, R", "Lul\u00e9, D", "Heimrath, J", "Ludolph, AC", "Becker, W", "Kassubek, J"], "year": "2012", "journal": "BMC neurology", "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine whether there was a negative effect of caudal Zona Incerta deep brain stimulation (cZI DBS) on pharyngeal swallowing function in Parkinson's patients (PD).

Responsive neurostimulation, which delivers stimuli to 1 or 2 seizure foci in response to a detected seizure, recently completed a successful multicenter trial. Several other trials of brain stimulation are in planning or underway. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) may provide a noninvasive method to stimulate cortex. Controlled studies of TMS are split on efficacy, which may depend on whether a seizure focus is near a possible region for stimulation. Seizure detection devices in the form of shake detectors via portable accelerometers can provide notification of an ongoing tonic-clonic seizure, or peace of mind in the absence of notification.

Prediction appears to be possible in a subpopulation of people with refractory seizures, and a clinical trial of an implantable prediction device is underway.

This study establishes layer six as a major mediator of cortical gain modulation and suggests that it could be a node through which convergent inputs from several brain areas can regulate the earliest steps of cortical visual processing.", "pages": "1324-32"}, {"volume": "366", "title": "Brain stimulation, learning, and memory.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16603926", "authors": ["Black, SE"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "abstract": "The aim was to assess the effect of deep brain stimulation for secondary hemidystonias associated with focal post-traumatic brain injuries.", "pages": "1324-32"}, {"volume": "366", "title": "Memory enhancement and deep-brain stimulation of the entorhinal area.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16798053", "authors": ["Suthana, N", "Haneef, Z", "Stern, J", "Mukamel, R", "Behnke, E", "Knowlton, B", "Fried, I"], "year": "2012", "journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "abstract": "Four patients underwent deep brain stimulation for the treatment of medically refractory secondary hemidystonia associated with post-traumatic brain injury.

The results were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy controls. Voluntary blinking was assessed by asking participants to blink as fast as possible; spontaneous blinking was recorded during two 60s rest periods; reflex blinking was evoked by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve. Blinking were recorded and analysed with the SMART motion system. STN-DBS increased the peak velocity and amplitude for both the closing and opening voluntary blink phases, but prolonged the inter-phase pause duration. l-dopa had no effects on voluntary blinking but reversed the increased inter-phase pause duration seen during STN-DBS. Spontaneous blink rate increased after either STN-DBS or l-dopa. Reflex blinking kinematics were not modified by STN-DBS or l-dopa. The STN-DBS effects on voluntary blinking kinematics and spontaneous blinking rate may occur as results of changes of cortico-basal ganglia activity. The prolonged pause duration of voluntary blinking indicates that STN-DBS has detrimental effects on the cranial region.

The beneficial action of DBS is closely related to the stimulation sit. And the efficacy of high frequency stimulation of lateral habenula is one of the best choice. In depression, the concentration of 5-HT released by the raphe nuclei is decreased. It's due to mainly the overactivation of the lateral habenula.

Eight Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation underwent H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) while they performed kinematically matched sequence learning and movement tasks at baseline and during stimulation. Network analysis revealed a significant learning-related spatial covariance pattern characterized by consistent increases in subject expression during stimulation (p = 0.008, permutation test). The network was associated with increased activity in the lateral cerebellum, dorsal premotor cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus, with covarying reductions in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and orbitofrontal cortex. Stimulation-mediated increases in network activity correlated with concurrent improvement in learning performance (p < 0.02). To determine whether similar changes occurred during dopaminergic pharmacotherapy, we studied the subjects during an intravenous levodopa infusion titrated to achieve a motor response equivalent to stimulation. Despite consistent improvement in motor ratings during infusion, levodopa did not alter learning performance or network activity. Analysis of learning-related rCBF in network regions revealed improvement in baseline abnormalities with STN stimulation but not levodopa. These effects were most pronounced in the SMA. In this region, a consistent rCBF response to stimulation was observed across subjects and trials (p = 0.01), although the levodopa response was not significant. These findings link the cognitive treatment response in PD to changes in the activity of a specific cerebello-premotor cortical network.
