In each experiment the mediolateral boundaries of the zone were localized on the cortical surface by recording field potentials mediated via climbing fibres and evoked in the zone by activity elicited in spino-olivocerebellar paths through percutaneous stimulation of the fore- and hindlimbs; a small (15-30 nl) injection of 1-2% WGA-HRP was then made into the zone. Distributions in the deep cerebellar nuclei were determined with light microscopy both for C-N terminal labelling due to anterograde axonal transport by Purkinje cells and for cell bodies labelled due to retrograde transport in N-C axons. The extent to which retrogradely labelled olivary neurones were confined to the part of the rostral medial accessory olive that innervates the C2 zone was estimated to provide an indication of the degree to which the injected tracer might have spread beyond the boundaries of the zone. The C-N projection from the part of the C2 zone in PML pa terminates almost exclusively (probably exclusively) in nucleus interpositus posterior (NIP) at all medio-lateral levels of the nucleus but most extensively at middle and lateral levels. At most levels the C-N termination territory forms a crescent with its outer curve following the caudal, dorsal and rostral borders of the nucleus and as a result it is mainly in the dorsal half of the nucleus. There is heavy overlap with the projection from the lobule V part of the C2 zone previously studied by us. The projection from the C2 zone in PML pp terminates entirely in NIP, but although at middle medio-lateral levels in the nucleus there is substantial overlap with the PML pa and lobule V projections, the projection territory is confined to the medial half of the nucleus. Evidence was obtained compatible with the view that throughout the C2 zone its lateral and medial parts project to different parts of NIP. In both PML pa and pp the C2 zone receives N-C projections from NIP. Most of the N-C cells concerned are in the dorsal half of NIP and the great majority lie within the corresponding C-N projection territory. However, the N-C projection to PML pa appears c. 6 times heavier than that to PML pp and the PML pa part of the zone also receives a minor additional projection from nucleus lateralis (NL).

The C-N projection from the part of the zone in PML pc (a hindlimb part) also terminates virtually exclusively in NIA but primarily in almost all parts of the medial third of the nucleus. There is, nevertheless, sufficient overlap between the PML pa and PML pc projections that approximately one third of the termination territory of each projection overlaps that of the other. The PML pc part of the zone is almost entirely lacking in a N-C projection, as previously found for the lobule V part of the C1 zone (and C3 zone). However, the PML pa part of the zone receives N-C projections that arise, in descending order of size, from nucleus interpositus posterior (NIP), from NIA, from the NIA/nucleus lateralis (NL) fusion area and (perhaps) NL.

The quantitative autoradiographic [14C]deoxyglucose method was used to measure local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in barrel cortex of mice two, four, eight, 64, 160 and 250 days after the lesion. Metabolic rates were measured in three groups of animals: (i) mice with lesions that had all whiskers clipped; (ii) mice with lesions that had left whiskers B1-3 and D1-3 stimulated; and (iii) unoperated mice that had left whiskers B1-3 and D1-3 stimulated. Compared with the metabolic rates in barrels C1-3 of stimulated unoperated mice, barrels C1-3 of stimulated mice with lesions showed the first discernible increase in metabolic rate four days after the lesion. The increase became distinct at 64 days, but attained statistical significance only approximately 160 days after the lesion. The lesion per se, i.e. without whisker stimulation, caused only a small increase in metabolic rate in barrels C1-3 accounting for not more than one fourth of the increase in metabolic rate measured after whisker deflection. The removal of whisker follicles C1-3 led, therefore, to an enlargement of the metabolic representations of the adjacent whiskers into the barrels deprived by the lesion. The gradual consolidation of the alterations of the metabolic whisker map coincided with the regeneration of follicular nerves in the whiskerpad. We detected anomalous deep nerves innervating follicles surrounding the lesion at approximately 64 days, and the number of myelinated nerve fibres in the deep nerves of these follicles was increasing with increasing time after the lesion.

It is proposed here that a dynamic balance exists between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input to the spinal dorsal horn that functions to prevent central sensitization following brief, mild, noxious stimulation. Following more severe stimulation and injury, there is a loss of these inhibitory mechanisms that allow central sensitization to proceed. Single-unit recordings were made from L4-L5 deep dorsal horn neurons (wide dynamic range and nociceptive specific) from barbiturate-anesthetized rats that were non-inflamed or had a carrageenan-inflamed hindpaw. Baseline test responses to mechanical stimuli were obtained and normalized to 100%. An electrical conditioning stimulus (1 Hz, 20 s, C-fiber strength) was applied to the tibial nerve or the neuronal receptive field. Five seconds later the test stimulus was repeated and the magnitude of response compared to baseline. During the conditioning stimulus, 46% of the neurons from non-inflamed and inflamed rats showed wind-up although the magnitude of wind-up was significantly greater for inflamed rats. The remaining neurons showed no change (36-46%) or wind-down (8-18%). Five seconds following the end of the conditioning stimulus 67% of the neurons from non-inflamed rats had attenuated responses to mechanical stimuli (36% of baseline). The remaining neurons were either unaffected (30%) or facilitated (3%). Following inflammation significantly fewer neurons (28%) had attenuated responses and the magnitude of attenuation was significantly less than in non-inflamed rats (54% of baseline). The responses of the remaining neurons were unaffected (54%) or facilitated (18%). During subsequent test stimuli, the responses of 30% of the neurons from non-inflamed rats were facilitated to 140% of baseline. The responses of 46% of neurons from inflamed rats were facilitated to 160% of baseline. In these neurons there was significantly less initial attenuation following inflammation compared to non-inflamed rats. The response of the neuron during the electrical conditioning had no effect upon the response following conditioning. The conditioning stimulus given transcutaneously within the receptive field produced qualitatively similar results to tibial nerve stimulation. In non-inflamed rats, when the conditioning/test-stimulus interval was increased from 5 s to 10-30 s, the responses of 20% of the neurons were attenuated (compared to 67%) and the mean magnitude of attenuation was 52% of baseline (compared to 36% of baseline). However, the responses of only 33% of the neurons were ultimately facilitated (compared to 30%). The present study documents a short period following a low-frequency C-fiber input in which the response to natural stimuli is suppressed. It is suggested that this attenuation, whether or not expressed, prevents a significant portion of deep dorsal horn neurons from becoming sensitized to C-fiber input. This functions to prevent central sensitization when the noxious stimulus does not produce inflammation and it is not beneficial to the animal to become hyperalgesic (i.e., to alter its behavior in order to protect an injured limb and reduce painful sensations). Following injury-producing tissue damage and inflammation the mechanisms that produce the attenuation are reduced, with a concomitant increase in excitation to electrical and natural stimuli, suggesting that the attenuation is inhibitory modulation of nociceptive input and injury results in a disinhibition producing an increase in excitability and central sensitization.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Influence of the superior colliculus on the primate blink reflex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9372288", "authors": ["Gnadt, JW", "Lu, SM", "Breznen, B", "Basso, MA", "Henriquez, VM", "Evinger, C"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Although pallidotomy and chronic pallidal stimulation are highly effective in suppressing levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), both methods also seem to be effective in reducing parkinsonian disability. However, the simultaneous improvement of LID and motor signs is hard to explain with the classic model of basal ganglia circuitry. Taking advantage of the fact that deep brain stimulation is reversible and that implanted electrodes contain four discrete stimulation sites, we investigated the effect of stimulation on different sites of the globus pallidus (GP) in five PD patients. Stimulation in the dorsal GP (upper contact) significantly improved gait, akinesia, and rigidity and could induce dyskinesia when patients were in the \"off\" state. In contrast, stimulation in the posteroventral GP (lower contact) significantly worsened gait and akinesia, although the reduction in rigidity remained. For patients in the \"on\" state, stimulation in the posteroventral GP dramatically reduced LID but, as in the \"off\" state, worsened gait and akinesia, thus canceling out the antiparkinsonian effect of levodopa. Our results indicate that stimulation had a striking different effect on parkinsonism and dyskinesia when applied at two different loci of the GP and that stimulation applied in the posteroventral GP produced opposite effects on rigidity and on akinesia.

Some bursting cells were antidromically activated by stimuli applied to the superficial or deep layers of presubiculum, but never by stimuli applied to deep layers of medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC). Some non-bursting subicular neurons were antidromically activated by stimuli applied to dMEC, but never by stimuli applied to presubiculum. Antidromic population events in subiculum were single spikes when deep MEC was stimulated, but were bursts when presubiculum was stimulated, even in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists. Population bursts consist of 2 or more population spikes with peak to peak intervals of approximately 5 ms. That population bursts occur in slices where excitatory transmission is blocked suggests that such population bursts reflect coincident bursts by individual neurons. Short-latency (< 5 ms) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked in both subicular cell types in response to single entorhinal, presubicular and CA1 stimuli. Long-latency (> 10 ms) EPSPs were seen in both cell types in response to presubicular, but not entorhinal or CA1 stimulation.

Single and dual simultaneous intracellular recordings from cortical neurons were performed in the anterior part of suprasylvian gyrus (area 5). Synaptic responses were obtained by stimulating the suprasylvian cortex, 2-3 mm anterior to the recording site, as well as the thalamic lateral posterior (LP) nucleus.

J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2602-2615, 1997. The entorhinal cortex receives sensory inputs from the piriform cortex and modulatory inputs from the medial septum. To examine short-term synaptic facilitation effects in these pathways, current source density (CSD) analysis was used first to localize the entorhinal cortex membrane currents, which generate field potentials evoked by stimulation of these afferents. Field potentials were recorded at 50-micron intervals through the medial entorhinal cortex in urethan-anesthetized rats and the one-dimensional CSD was calculated. Piriform cortex stimulation evoked a surface-negative, deep-positive field potential component in the entorhinal cortex with mean onset and peak latencies of 10.4 and 18.4 ms. The component followed brief 100-Hz stimulation, consistent with a monosynaptic response. CSD analysis linked the component to a current sink, which often began in layer I before peaking in layer II. A later, surface-positive field potential component peaked at latencies near 45 ms and was associated with a current source in layer II. Medial septal stimulation evoked positive and negative field potential components which peaked at latencies near 7 and 16 ms, respectively. A weaker and more prolonged surface-negative, deep-positive component peaked at latencies near 25 ms. The early components were generated by currents in the hippocampal formation, and the late surface-negative component was generated by currents in layers II to IV of the entorhinal cortex. Short-term facilitation effects in conscious animals were examined using electrodes chronically implanted near layer II of the entorhinal cortex. Paired-pulse stimulation of the piriform cortex at interpulse intervals of 30 and 40 ms caused the largest facilitation (248%) of responses evoked by the second pulse. Responses evoked by medial septal stimulation also were facilitated maximally (59%) by a piriform cortex conditioning pulse delivered 30-40 ms earlier. Paired pulse stimulation of the medial septum caused the largest facilitation (149%) at intervals of 70 ms, but piriform cortex evoked responses were facilitated maximally (46%) by a septal conditioning pulse 100-200 ms earlier. Frequency potentiation effects were maximal during 12- to 18-Hz stimulation of either the piriform cortex or medial septum.

There is evidence that the neural substrates responsible for defensive behavior in this level of the midbrain tectum (MT) may also be responsible for fear-induced analgesia. This study was aimed at examining the characteristics of the analgesia that follows the defense-oriented reactions induced by electrical midbrain tectum stimulation at freezing and escape thresholds. The animals were submitted to the tail-flick test, following the induction of the defense behavioral responses. The obtained results show that the antinociception that follows the freezing and escape behaviors were not antagonized by MT microinjections of the opioid antagonist naltrexone.

Fink). What is not yet known is which of these mechanisms is crucial for the psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. However, it is clear that the effects of ST tend to be relatively acute, and do not attack the deep-seated abnormalities that are the underlying causes of recurrences of affective disorders. This is corroborated by the fact that in animals, most of the effects of ECS on catecholamines and their receptors (and on receptors for benzodiazepines or neuropeptides such as TRH) tend to be relatively transient, and in most cases have been found to represent compensatory adaptations to the induced motor convulsions. However, recent preclinical data using attenuation, and clinical findings using reiterated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), suggest that it may not be necessary to provoke a clonic convulsion in order to achieve the beneficial psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. In rodents receiving stimulation to the cerebellar tonsil, seven daily subacute low-frequency sessions (stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes) produced clear improvement in clonic convulsions and in post-discharge thresholds, together with durable inhibition of convulsions when stimulation was resumed (Weiss et al., 1995). Stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes was more effective than stimulation at 10 or 20 Hz in attenuating convulsions. Although reiterated ECS also induced an anti-triggering effect, this dissipated rapidly over five days (Post et al., 1984). It is of great interest that recent publications have shown that rTMS at 10 or 20 Hz to the left frontal cortex, administered to patients suffering from refractory depression (George et al., 1995) or to patients (hospitalised or not) with milder degrees of depression (Pasquale-Leon et al., 1996), had a moderate or marked antidepressant effect. In these studies, rTMS showed few unwanted effects (other than mild pain in some patients, due to contraction of the temporal muscles); it did not induce motor convulsions, and did not, as such, appear to be associated with the memory loss described in subjective accounts or in preliminary neuropsychological tests (Little and Kimbrell et al., 1996). The optimal frequencies, durations and positions for rTMS to maximise its antidepressant effect still remain to be determined. However, the first controlled and open studies have tended to show that (because of the capacity of rapid magnetic fluxes to produce sub-convulsant electrical discharges that are relatively localised in the brain), rTMS may be found to be a clinically useful antidepressant model. This would suggest the possibility that some of the neurochemical changes induced by the clonic convulsions of ECS could be directly induced by stimulation at the very edge of the threshold (but still below it); this would open up the hope that one day these endogenous neurochemical processes could be identified and exploited in an optimal way for therapeutic purposes.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "758", "title": "Muscarinic reduction of GABAergic synaptic potentials results in disinhibition of the AMPA/kainate-mediated EPSP in auditory cortex.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "3404460", "authors": ["Aramakis, VB", "Bandrowski, AE", "Ashe, JH"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Stereotactic surgery for movement disorders is currently undergoing a re-evaluation.

The presubiculum and parasubiculum are retrohippocampal structures bordered by the subiculum and medial entorhinal cortex. Deep layer (IV-VI) neurons from this region exhibit stable synaptically triggered burst behaviour which distinguishes them from superficial layer (I-III) cells. This functional separation was examined with intracellular and field potential recordings from horizontal slices of rat brain. Neurobiotin labelling and rapid Golgi techniques were used to obtain anatomical evidence of axonal trajectories. 2. Extracellular stimulation of the subiculum, deep medial entorhinal cortex or superficial pre- or parasubiculum caused, in deep layer cells only, a short latency burst discharge which could be followed by one or more after-discharges. Bursts appeared after repetitive stimulation and were stable for the life of the slice. Each event was supported by giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Events were similar whether they were evoked in horizontal slices or slices cut perpendicular to the horizontal plane. 3. Bath application of the NMDA receptor antagonist 3-[2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP; 5 microM) elevated the threshold for evoking the giant EPSP. Higher concentrations (10-15 microM) reduced the amplitude and duration of the giant EPSP. Bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist beta-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 5 microM) eliminated the evoked EPSP. 4. In intact slices, superficial layer neurons of pre- and parasubiculum could exhibit EPSPs coincident with bursts recorded in the deep layers. However, in isolated subsections of horizontal slices or in 'vertical slices', both of which contained only pre- and/or parasubiculum, evoked or picrotoxin-induced bursts occurred only in deep layer cells. Superficial layer cells in these subsections showed no response to deep layer events. 5. Antidromic population spikes confirmed projections from superficial cell layers of pre- and parasubiculum down to their deep cell layers. Reciprocal antidromic responses were absent. 6. Axons of superficial layer stellate and pyramidal cells had horizontal collaterals and at least one ascending and one descending collateral. Branches of the descending collaterals were given off in layer V and some axons were found to reach the angular bundle. Axons of deep layer stellate and pyramidal cells also had horizontal collaterals and descending collaterals which could be traced to the angular bundle. One ascending axon collateral was found among the thirty-one deep layer cells examined morphologically. 7. We conclude that the deep layer cells of the presubiculum and parasubiculum are richly interconnected with excitatory synapses. These interconnections can generate giant excitatory synaptic potentials that support the bursting behaviour exhibited by these neurons. Any of the excitatory inputs to deep layer cells can trigger the population bursts and specific inputs from entorhinal cortex produce the after-discharges. Further, connections between superficial and deep layer cells appear to be almost exclusively in the direction of superficial to deep. The absence of significant ascending input can account for the functional separation of superficial and deep layer neurons of presubiculum and parasubiculum.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Tectal codification of eye movements in goldfish studied by electrical microstimulation. f.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "6045200", "authors": ["Salas, C", "Herrero, L", "Rodriguez, F", "Torres, B"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "The present study is concerned with the ability of muscarinic actions of acetylcholine (ACh) to modulate glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic transmission in the in vitro rat auditory cortex. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from layer II-III pyramidal neurons, and the fast-EPSP (AMPA/kainate), fast-IPSP (GABA(A)), and slow-IPSP (GABA(B)), were elicited following a stimulus to deep gray/white matter. Acetyl-beta-methylcholine (MCh), a muscarinic receptor agonist, applied by either superfusion or iontophoresis, produced an atropine-sensitive increase or decrease in the amplitude of the fast-EPSP. The effect of MCh could be predicted by the response of the fast-EPSP to paired-pulse stimulation (i.e. a conditioning pulse followed 300 ms later by a test pulse). The fast-EPSP was decreased in amplitude by MCh in cases where the test-EPSP was suppressed in the pre-MCh condition, and increased in amplitude when the test-EPSP was facilitated. The fast- and slow-IPSPs were always reduced by MCh. In several experiments, the strength of synaptic inhibition was systematically modified by varying stimulus intensity. When the fast-EPSP was elicited in the absence of IPSPs, it was decreased in amplitude by MCh. However, when the fast-EPSP was elicited in conjunction with large IPSPs it was increased in amplitude during MCh. Because the magnitude of the fast-EPSP is influenced by the degree of temporal overlap with IPSPs, it was hypothesized that enhancement of the fast-EPSP was the result of disinhibition produced as a consequence of muscarinic reduction of GABAergic IPSPs. This view was supported by the finding that MCh could reduce the amplitude of pharmacologically isolated GABAergic IPSPs (i.e. elicited in the absence of glutamatergic transmission).

The responses of 175 identified corticospinal axons (conduction velocities of 24-95 m/s) were recorded from the lateral corticospinal tract at the T12-L3 spinal level. A single magnetic or electrical stimulus could evoke an early spike corresponding to the direct (D) wave in surface recorded volleys and was termed a D response. In the same axon, up to four further spikes, termed indirect (I) responses, could also be evoked. At a given intensity of stimulation, D responses had clear thresholds and fixed latencies, whereas I responses were labile in both respects. For TMS and TES, the thresholds of both D and I responses were inversely correlated with axonal conduction velocity. For TMS, fast conducting axons (> 75 m/s) had lower thresholds for D responses, while more slowly conducting axons (< 55 m/s) had lower thresholds for I responses. Very few of the axons with a conduction velocity of < 40 m/s (three out of 23) gave a D response to TMS. For TES, the majority of axons had lower thresholds for D responses or a similar threshold for both D and I responses. At threshold, the latencies of D responses evoked by TMS and TES were consistent with activation within the cortex, while TES also excited some corticospinal axons deep to the cortex.

In a large medial zone, stimulation within the intermediate and deep layers of the tectum evoked contraversive saccades of both eyes, whose direction and amplitude were roughly congruent with the retinotopic representation of the visual world within overlying layers. These saccades were minimally influenced by the initial position of the eye in the orbit. The topographical arrangement of evoked saccades and body movements suggests that this tectal zone triggers orienting responses in a similar way to those described in other vertebrates. Stimulations applied within the caudal tectum also evoked contraversive saccades, but in disagreement with the overlying retinotopic map--the vertical component was absent. Taken together with electrically evoked body movements reported in free-swimming fish, these saccades could reveal that this zone is involved in escape responses. When stimulations were applied within the anteromedial zone of the tectum, contraversive movements of both eyes appeared much more dependent on initial eye position. Saccades elicited from this area displayed characteristics of \"goal-directed saccades\" which were similar to those described in the cat. The generation of goal-directed movements from the anteromedial zone suggests that this portion of the goldfish optic tectum has a different intrinsic organization or is connected with the brainstem saccade generator in a different fashion than the medial zone. Finally, stimulation of the extreme anteromedial zone evoked convergent eye movements. These movements and those reported in free-swimming fish following electrical stimulation of this tectal area suggest that this zone could be involved in feeding responses. The relationships between the parameters of electrical stimulation and the characteristics of elicited saccades suggest that the stimulated location within the tectum determines a constant direction in the evoked saccade, whereas the amount and duration of tectal activity, as mimicked by changes in stimulus parameters, together with the tectal locus, determine the velocity and amplitude of the evoked saccade.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "112", "title": "The magnitude of the central response to esophageal electrical stimulation is intensity dependent.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "7776249", "authors": ["Hollerbach, S", "Kamath, MV", "Chen, Y", "Fitzpatrick, D", "Upton, AR", "Tougas, G"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "abstract": "Granular/vesicular transport is thought to be supported by microtubule-based force-generating adenosine triphosphatases such as kinesin.

Kinesin expression in primary cultures of mouse beta-cells then was selectively suppressed by antimouse beta-cell kinesin heavy chain antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Analysis of insulin secretion determined that the basal level of insulin secretion from the treated cells was decreased by 50%. Furthermore, glucose-stimulated insulin release from treated beta-cells was reduced by almost 70% after suppression of kinesin expression by antisense treatment. The findings from this study provide the first direct evidence that kinesin, a microtubule-based motor protein, plays an important role in insulin secretion.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "40", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for intractable pain: a 15-year experience.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "7823167", "authors": ["Kumar, K", "Toth, C", "Nath, RK"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "We studied the short- and long-term epileptogenic effects of massed stimulation (MS) of the piriform cortex.

Animals were retested (5 stimulations) 3-4 times later at different time points to check for the kindled state. Our data showed that MS resulted in delayed development of severe epilepsy.

Unexpectedly, dramatic seizure activity occurred 4-7 weeks after MS. This was manifested by (1) generalized tonic-clonic convulsions with multiple failings, which were elicited repeatedly during retest; (2) frequent progression of elicited generalized convulsions into a prolonged (> 8 min) postictal convulsive state expressed mainly by continuous partial seizures and even new bouts of generalized seizures, and (3) development of mild spontaneous seizures.

As a result of increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of the basal ganglia and the demonstration of surgical alleviation of experimental parkinsonism, surgery has regained a paramount importance in the management of PD. The aim of pallidotomy and DBS is to reduce the excessive inhibitory output from the GPi and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr). Pallidotomy and DBS of the STN or GPi aim to reverse the pathophysiological consequences of dopamine deficiency in PD, and should be considered entirely symptomatic treatments. The ideal candidates for pallidotomy are young patients in good general health in whom dyskinesias are the main reasons for disability. Patients with severe bilateral problems uncontrollable with present pharmacological tools are candidates for DBS. As yet, there are no formal data to help decide how to choose between GPi and STN stimulation. In our practice, patients are allocated to GPi stimulation when 'on' dyskinesias are extremely severe. In most other instances, we prefer to perform STN stimulation. At present there is almost no reason to decide for the thalamic stimulation since tremor is equally arrested by STN stimulation, which in addition improves all other features of PD. Equally the only indication for thalamotomy would be a patient with long-standing tremor as the main clinical manifestation, which can not be controlled with drugs. The proportion of patients in whom the thalamus will be the preferable target for either DBS or thalamotomy is small (less than 5%). Grafting aims to repair the nigrostriatal pathway and restore dopaminergic function in the striatum. In the future implants containing not only dopaminergic cells but also growth factors and a variety of other substances could become a method to not only functionally compensate the biochemical abnormalities of PD but also to arrest its progression. This technique is limited to a few centres around the world owing to the technical, logistical and ethical problems of obtaining and handling embryonic cells. At present, grafting of dopaminergic cells is perhaps best suited for patients with young-onset PD (less than 45 years old) who are at high risk of developing complications within a short time of beginning pharmacological treatment and in whom the idea of making lesions or implanting electrodes into the brain for decades seems less appealing. Consideration of surgery in any given patient should be weighed against the risks (about 1% mortality and 2-6% of severe morbidity-hemiplegia, cognitive deficit, speech problems, etc.) associated with these techniques. The development of better imaging methods and the growing expertise of multidisciplinary teams will undoubtedly make surgery for PD safer and more effective in the future.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "In situ hybridization for c-fos mRNA reveals the involvement of the superior colliculus in the propagation of seizure activity in genetically epilepsy-prone rats.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8446632", "authors": ["Ribak, CE", "Manio, AL", "Navetta, MS", "Gall, CM"], "year": "1997", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "Hypothermia protects the brain and other vital organs during periods of ischaemia. We differentiate between mild (36-34 degrees C), moderate (33-29 degrees C), deep (28-17 degrees C) and profund (16-4 degrees C) hypothermia. During hypothermia, cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow decrease dependent on temperature. The relation between temperature and cerebral metabolism is expressed by the temperature coeffizient Q10, which is the ratio between two metabolic rates separated by 10 degrees C. The following factors contribute to decreases in cerebral blood flow seen during hypothermia: cerebral metabolic depression, decreases in cardiac output, and decreases in arterial blood pressure with pH-stat management, increases in hematocrit and in blood viscosity. Mild or moderate hypothermia reduces histopathological damage and neurological deficits if started before and during cerebral ischaemia. Hypothermia may also improve neurologic outcome if initiated following focal cerebral ischaemia, but is less effective after global ischaemic insults. Mild hypothermia appears to be safer and more effective compared to moderate hypothermia. In most instances, deep hypothermia renders neurologic outcome worse, which is most likely related to the generation of toxic metabolites and inadequate myocardial function during rewarming. The neuroprotective effects of hypothermia are related to several mechanisms along the ischaemic cascade: prevention of postischaemic hypoperfusion, reduction of functional and basal metabolism, decreased accumulation of lactic acid and oedema formation, inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter release, prevention of Ca(++)- and Na(+)-influx, inhibition of lipid peroxidase activity, and free radical formation, stimulation of regenerative immediate early genes.

The first multisensory neurons (somatosensory-auditory) were found at 12 dpn, and visually responsive multisensory neurons were not found until 20 dpn. Early multisensory neurons responded weakly to sensory stimuli, had long latencies, large receptive fields, and poorly developed response selectivities. Most surprising, however, was their inability to integrate combinations of sensory cues to produce significant response enhancement (or depression), a characteristic feature of the adult. Responses to combinations of sensory cues differed little from responses to their modality-specific components. At 28 dpn an abrupt physiological change was noted. Some multisensory neurons now integrated combinations of cross-modality cues and exhibited significant response enhancements when these cues were spatially coincident and response depressions when the cues were spatially disparate. During the next 2 months the incidence of multisensory neurons, and the proportion of these neurons capable of adult-like multisensory integration, gradually increased. Once multisensory integration appeared in a given neuron, its properties changed little with development. Even the youngest integrating neurons showed superadditive enhancements and spatial characteristics of multisensory integration that were indistinguishable from the adult. Nevertheless, neonatal and adult multisensory neurons differed in the manner in which they integrated temporally asynchronous stimuli, a distribution that may reflect the very different behavioral requirements at different ages.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from layer II-III pyramidal neurons and responses elicited by either stimulation of deep gray matter or iontophoretic application of glutamate receptor agonists. Iontophoresis of the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine (MCh) produced an atropine-sensitive reduction in the amplitude of glutamate-induced membrane depolarizations that was followed by a long-lasting (at least 20 min) response enhancement. Glutamate depolarizations were enhanced by MCh when elicited in the presence of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl, benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) but not the NMDA antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) or MK-801 hydrogen maleate. The magnitude of enhancement was voltage-dependent with the percentage increase greater at more depolarized membrane potentials. An involvement of NMDA receptors in these MCh-mediated effects was tested by using AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists to isolate the NMDA-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) from other synaptic potentials. The slow EPSP and iontophoretic responses to NMDA were similarly modified by MCh, i.e., both being reduced during and enhanced (15-55 min) following MCh application. Cholinergic modulation of NMDA responses involves the engagement of G proteins, as enhancement was prevented by intracellular infusion with the nonhydrolyzable GDP analog guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) trilithium salt (GDPbetaS). GDPbetaS was without effect on the early MCh-induced response suppression.

Microinjection of biotin-dextran amine as an anterograde tracer into the prefrontal cortex revealed the following in the coronal, sagittal and oblique planes of rat brain. (1) Axonal fibers from the rostral prelimbic cortex projected at an angle of approximately 60 degrees to the horizontal plane through the infralimbic region and mainly entered the rostromedial accumbens.

Prior to eye-opening (postnatal day 2-10), NMDA-R1 immunoreactivity is already present within dendritic and growth cones, even though these profiles are devoid of synaptic specializations. This indicates that synthesis and incorporation of NMDA-R1 into plasma membranes are independent of form vision. During the next 2-3 weeks, i.e., preceding the onset of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (around the fourth week), NMDA-R1 immunoreactivity changes from a diffuse distribution within dendrites to a more discrete aggregation over postsynaptic densities of axo-spinous junctions. Such clustering of NMDA-R1 at synapses may be a prerequisite for stabilization and strengthening of synapses activated by visual stimulation during the critical period. Furthermore, only during the first several weeks, intensely NMDA-R1-immunoreactive neurons are present in the infragranular layers and the white matter. Enrichment of NMDA-R1 in the deep-layer neurons may reflect the neurons' supportive role in the development of cortical circuitry, serving as transient synaptic targets for geniculate and cortico-cortical afferents while these afferents 'wait' in the infragranular for their ultimate, life-long target neurons to become receptive in the upper layers.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "82", "title": "Neural substrates of discriminative avoidance learning and classical eyeblink conditioning in rabbits: a double dissociation.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9295483", "authors": ["Gabriel, M", "Kang, E", "Poremba, A", "Kubota, Y", "Allen, MT", "Miller, DP", "Steinmetz, JE"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "The effects of deep brain or epidural cortical stimulation on poststroke involuntary and voluntary movement disorders were analyzed in a total of 64 patients.

The PC (\"primary olfactory cortex\") is the largest area of the mammalian olfactory cortex and receives direct projections from the olfactory bulb via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). Beside the obvious involvement in olfactory perception and discrimination, the PC, because of its unique intrinsic associative fiber system and its various connections to and from other limbic nuclei, has been implicated in the study of memory processing, spread of excitatory waves, and in the study of brain disorders such as epilepsy with particular emphasis on the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy with complex partial seizures. The interest in the kindling model is based primarily on the following observations. (1) The PC contains the most susceptible neural circuits of all forebrain regions for electrical (or chemical) induction of limbic seizures. (2) During electrical stimulation of other limbic brain regions, broad and large afterdischarges can be observed in the ipsilateral PC, indicating that the PC is activated early during the kindling process. (3) The interictal discharge, which many consider to be the hallmark of epilepsy, originates in the PC, independent of which structure serves as the kindled focus. (4) Autoradiographic studies of cerebral metabolism in rat amygdala kindling show that, during focal seizures, the area which exhibits the most consistent increase in glucose utilization is the ipsilateral paleocortex, particularly the PC. (5) During the commonly short initial afterdischarges induced by stimulation of the amygdala at the early stages of kindling, the PC is the first region that exhibits induction of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos. (6) The PC is the most sensitive brain structure to brain damage by continuous or frequent stimulation of the amygdala or hippocampus. (7) Amygdala kindling leads to a circumscribed loss of GABAergic neurons in the ipsilateral PC, which is likely to explain the increase in excitability of PC pyramidal neurons during kindling. (8) Kindling of the amygdala or hippocampus induces astrogliosis in the PC, indicating neuronal death in this brain region. Furthermore, activation of microglia is seen in the PC after amygdala kindling. (9) Complete bilateral lesions of the PC block the generalization of seizures upon kindling from the hippocampus or olfactory bulb. Incomplete or unilateral lesions are less effective in this regard, but large unilateral lesions of the PC and adjacent endopiriform nucleus markedly increase the threshold for induction of focal seizures from stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) prior to and after kindling, indicating that the PC critically contributes to regulation of excitability in the amygdala. (10) Potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the PC markedly increases the threshold for induction of kindled seizures via stimulation of the BLA, again indicating a critical role of the PC in regulation of seizure susceptibility of the amygdala. Microinjections of NMDA antagonists or sodium channel blockers into the PC block seizure generalization during kindling development. (11) Neurophysiological studies on the amygdala-PC slice preparation from kindled rats showed that kindling of the amygdala induces long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy in the ipsilateral PC, including spontaneous discharges and enhanced susceptibility to evoked burst responses. The epileptiform potentials in PC slice preparations from kindled rats seem to originate in neuron at the deep boundary of PC. Spontaneous firing and enhanced excitability of PC neurons in response to kindling from other sites is also seen in vivo, substantiating the fact that kindling induces long-lasting changes in the PC c", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "733", "title": "Kindling antagonism: interactions of the amygdala with the piriform, perirhinal, and insular cortices.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "2898511", "authors": ["Mohapel, P", "Corcoran, ME"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "1. In early local feedback models for controlling horizontal saccade amplitude, a feedback signal of instantaneous eye position is continuously subtracted from a reference signal of desired eye position at a comparator. The output of the comparator is dynamic motor error, the remaining distance the eyes must rotate to reach the saccadic goal. When feedback reduces dynamic motor error to zero, the saccade stops on target. Two classes of local feedback model have been proposed for controlling oblique saccades (i.e., saccades with both horizontal and vertical components). In \"independent comparator\" models, separate horizontal and vertical comparators maintain independent representations of horizontal and vertical dynamic motor error. Thus, once an oblique desired displacement signal is established, the horizontal and vertical amplitudes of oblique saccades are under independent feedback control. In \"vectorial comparator\" models, output cells in the motor map of the superior colliculus act as site-specific vectorial comparators. For a given oblique desired displacement, a single comparator controls the amplitudes of both components. Because vectorial comparator models do not maintain separate representations of horizontal and vertical dynamic motor error, they cannot exert independent control over the component amplitudes of oblique saccades. 2. We tested differential predictions of these two types of models by electrically stimulating sites in the superior colliculus of rhesus monkey immediately after either vertical or horizontal visually guided saccades. We have shown previously that, despite the fixed site of collicular stimulation, the amplitude of the visually guided saccades systematically alters the amplitude of the corresponding component (horizontal or vertical) of stimulation-evoked saccades. However, in the present study, we examined the effect of the visually guided saccades on the amplitude of the orthogonal component of stimulation-evoked saccades. 3. For a fixed site of collicular stimulation, vectorial comparator models predict that the initial visually guided saccade will influence both components of the ensuing stimulation-evoked saccade via the single feedback comparator. By contrast, independent comparator models permit the independent manipulation of the horizontal and vertical amplitudes of these oblique stimulation-evoked saccades. 4. In total, we collected data from 15 collicular stimulation sites. Immediately after either horizontal or vertical visually guided saccades of different amplitudes, we measured the horizontal and vertical amplitudes of saccades evoked by stimulation of the intermediate or deep layers of the superior colliculus. For each site, the duration, frequency, and current of the stimulation train were held constant. 5. Under these conditions, stimulation-evoked saccades followed visually guided saccades with short latency (18.1 +/- 6.7 ms, mean +/- SD). For every stimulation site tested, although the amplitude of the component of stimulation-evoked saccades corresponding to the direction of the preceding saccade (horizontal or vertical) varied systematically, the amplitude of the orthogonal component was roughly constant. 6. Thus the horizontal and vertical amplitudes of oblique stimulation-evoked saccades can be manipulated independently. Moreover, the peak velocity-amplitude relationships, the instantaneous velocity profiles, and the ratio of horizontal and vertical velocities and durations were very similar to those of visually guided saccades. 7. Independent comparator models can readily account for the ability to manipulate the amplitude of one component of oblique saccades without affecting the other. However, two-dimensional local feedback models that cannot exert independent control over the horizontal and vertical amplitudes of oblique saccades should be carefully reevaluated.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "111", "title": "Somatosensory evoked potentials following proprioceptive stimulation of finger in man.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "3193167", "authors": ["Mima, T", "Terada, K", "Maekawa, M", "Nagamine, T", "Ikeda, A", "Shibasaki, H"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Functional connectivity was maintained between the hippocampal area and the EC in vitro in a combined rat hippocampal-parahippocampal slice preparation by slicing with a vibratome at a 30-deg angle to the base of the brain. Three groups of animals were studied: naive animals, animals that had experienced a previous episode of (nonconvulsive) self-sustaining limbic system status epilepticus (SSLSE) induced by electrical stimulation resulting in a chronically epileptic state, and animals in an electrode control group. In chronically epileptic rats and the electrode control group, studies were done on tissue contralateral to the side of electrode implantation. 3. Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made from the superficial layers of EC. Neurons in the superficial layers of the EC were activated by stimulation of the deep layers within the EC or the angular bundle adjacent to the EC, which contains axons from EC neurons. Responses could be elicited by antidromic and synaptic mechanisms by stimulation at either site. In addition, a monosynaptic protocol was used that involved direct activation of interneurons with a stimulating electrode placed near the recording electrode in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate blockers D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2-3-dione (DNQX). 4. Responses were collected over a range of stimulus intensities, from very low to high intensities, to construct input/output function (I/O) curves. Amplitudes and durations were measured at the lowest stimulus intensity that elicited a maximum responses. 5. Extracellular field potential responses from electrode controls did not differ from naives qualitatively with respect to morphology of field potential responses or quantitatively with respect to response duration and amplitude. Field potential responses in tissue from post-SSLSE rats differed markedly in morphology from naive and electrode controls, being more complex, significantly longer in duration, and decreased in amplitude. These epileptiform responses were shortened markedly by blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with APV, but this manipulation did not convert responses to a normal morphology. These responses were abolished by blockade of non-NMDA mediated ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX. 6. During intracellular recordings of neurons in slices from both control and epileptic animals, neurons were quiescent under resting conditions in the absence of electrical stimulation. 7. Intracellular responses in electrode controls were identical to naive, and together were considered \"controls.\" In control tissue, evoked intracellular responses were similar to those previously described and most commonly consisted of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that was blocked partially by the NMDA-receptor antagonist APV, followed by hyperpolarizing potentials, which were identified electrophysiologically and pharmacologically as gamma-aminobuturic acid-A (GABAA)- and GABAB-receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). EPSPs were blocked completely by DNQX. 8. In chronically epileptic tissue, evoked intracellular responses differed markedly from responses in control animals, exhibiting all-or-none prolonged paroxysmal depolarizing events with multiple superimposed action potentials in response to a single shock. These depolarizing events were reduced in duration and amplitude, but not abolished, in APV. IPSPs were not seen or markedly reduced at all stimulus intensities. These intracellular responses never resembled control responses. Intracellur responss correlated precisely in morphology and duration with extracellular field potentials.

The positive feedback hypothesis would be supported if activity in the cerebellum was attenuated by inactivation of the red nucleus. A nonrecurrent source of excitation would have to be postulated if cerebellar activity was unaffected. 2. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar cortex, and vestibular nuclei. Burst discharges were evoked by brief electrical stimuli applied to the spinal cord that activated sensory structures. During inactivation of the red nucleus, sensory projections to the cerebellum that may evoke burst discharge were unaffected. Pressure microinjections of cobalt, lidocaine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) were used to reversibly inactivate the red nucleus. Saline injections were also tested. 3. Sustained discharge of all neurons recorded in the lateral cerebellar nucleus was greatly attenuated or blocked completely by injection of the pharmacological agents into the red nucleus. These effects were reversible. Of the recordings in the cerebellar cortex, 63% of these were blocked. All four compounds tested were effective blockers of the bursts, although the effects of GABA were less potent than the others. Saline injections into the red nucleus showed no effect. Burst discharges of single units recorded in either the medial cerebellar nucleus or the vestibular complex, which do not receive input from the red nucleus, showed no effect of red nucleus inactivation. 4. The results showed that sustained discharge in the cerebellum was significantly attenuated by inactivation of the red nucleus even though sensory input that may trigger the bursts was intact. These data support the hypothesis that sustained discharge in the cerebellorubral circuit is generated by a distributed neuronal network that uses positive feedback. The results have implications for mechanisms underlying normal brain function and some motor disorders.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "75", "title": "Spinothalamic and spinohypothalamic tract neurons in the sacral spinal cord of rats.

Pallidotomy and thalamotomy are the stereotactic procedures most commonly performed in patients who fall to obtain satisfactory relief of their symptoms despite optimal medical therapy. Small lesions disrupt the abnormal activity of basal ganglia circuitry. Other options currently being studied include chronic high-frequency stimulation and transplantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue. Chronic thalamic stimulation, involving permanent implantation of a deep brain electrode and a pulse generator, effectively controls contralateral tremor. Fetal nigral transplantation, which is still an experimental procedure, has the potential of restoring lost nigrostriatal pathway. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms and their response, or lack of response, to pharmacologic therapy.

In contrast, functional MR imaging detected one to three sulcal veins presumably draining blood from the adjacent motor hand area in 100% (24 of 24) of the hemispheres studied, and anatomical MR imaging and intraoperative mapping localized these veins in the CS. It is concluded that sulcal veins lying deep within the CS: 1) drain activated blood from the adjacent pre- or postcentral cortex during performance of a motor hand task; 2) can be identified easily with functional MR imaging; and 3) are an anatomical landmark for noninvasive identification of the CS and thus the sensorimotor strip. The detection of these veins provides a more consistent landmark than the detection of parenchymal motor areas by functional MR imaging; this technique may be used when classic anatomical landmarks fail to identify the sensorimotor strip.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "719", "title": "Effect of acute stimulation on Fos expression in spinal neurons in the presence of persisting C-fiber activity.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "7823136", "authors": ["Leah, JD", "Porter, J", "de-Pommery, J", "Men\u00e9trey, D", "Weil-Fuguzza, J"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "We employed the kindling antagonism paradigm to characterize the role of the amygdala (AM), piriform cortex (PIR), perirhinal cortex (PRH), and insular cortex (INS) in the propagation and expression of generalized seizures.

This was followed by a midfrontal negative wave (N1 at 44.8 ms) and a clear positivity at the contralateral centroparietal area (P2 at 48.0 ms). The evoked responses persisted in spite of the abolition of cutaneous and joint afferents of the finger caused by ischemic anesthesia, but they were lost by ischemic anesthesia of the forearm. Thus, the cortical evoked responses obtained in this study most probably reflect muscle afferent inputs. The scalp distribution of P1 suggested that its cortical generator source was different from that of the N20-P20 components of evoked potentials to electrical median nerve stimulation. Brodmann areas 2 and 3a of human brain, which are known to receive deep receptor inputs, are the most plausible generator sites for the early components of the proprioception-related evoked responses.

We wished to determine whether there are differences in the spatial pattern and intensity of synaptic activity within the conscious human forebrain when different forms and intensities of innocuous and noxious thermal stimuli are experienced. Accordingly, positron emission tomography (PET) with intravenous injection of H2(15)O was used to detect increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in normal humans as they discriminated differences in the intensity of noxious and innocuous thermal stimulation applied to the nondominant (left) arm. After stereotactic registration, subtraction images were formed from each subject by subtracting counts of emissions obtained during lower-intensity stimulation from those obtained during stimulation at higher intensities. A statistical summation analysis (Z score) of individual voxels was performed. In addition, volumes of interest were chosen on the basis of a priori hypotheses and the results of previously published PET studies. In both types of analysis, statistical thresholds were established with corrections for multiple comparisons. 2. Twenty-seven subjects were divided into three groups of nine subjects each for the three phases of this investigation. For studies in which repetitive contact heat stimuli were used, each subject was instructed in magnitude estimation on the basis of a scale for which 0 indicated \"no heat sensation,\" 7 \"just barely painful,\" and 10 \"just barely tolerable.\" For the study of pain elicited by immersion of the hand in cold water, subjects were instructed to use a scale in which 0 represented \"no pain\" and 10 represented just barely tolerable pain. 3. In the warm-discrimination study, two intensities of innocuous heat (36 and 43 degrees C) were applied with a thermode as repetitive 5-s contacts to the volar forearm for a total of approximately 100 s, 8 stimuli before and 12 during each scan. Each temperature was applied on alternate scans for a total of four scans per subject. Neither stimulus was rated painful. All subjects discriminated the 43 degrees C stimulus (average rating 5.90 +/- 1.43, mean +/- SD) from the 36 degrees C stimulus (1.96 +/- 1.08, mean +/- SD; t = 13.19, P < 0.0001). Significant increases in rCBF to the 43 degrees C stimuli were found in the contralateral ventral posterior thalamus, lenticular nucleus, medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's areas 10 and 32), and cerebellar vermis. 4. The procedure for discriminating between noxious and innocuous heat stimuli was identical to that used for warm discrimination except that the stimulation temperatures were 40 and 50 degrees C. All subjects rated the 50 degrees C stimuli as painful (average rating 8.9 +/- 0.9, mean +/- SD) and the 40 degrees C stimuli as warm, but not painful (2.1 +/- 1.0). Significant rCBF increases to 50 degrees C stimuli were found contralaterally in the thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, and secondary somatosensory (S2) and posterior insular cortices. Significant activity also appeared within the region of the contralateral anterior insula and lenticular nucleus. The ipsilateral premotor cortex and thalamus, and the medial dorsal midbrain and cerebellar vermis, also showed significant rCBF increases. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases just below the threshold for statistical significance were seen in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex [primary motor cortex (M1)/primary somatosensory cortex (S1)]. 5.

A goal of this study was to determine the sites in the diencephalon to which neurons in sacral spinal segments of rats project. Therefore, 95 neurons were recorded extracellularly in spinal segments L6-S2 of rats that were anesthetized with urethan. These neurons were activated initially antidromically with currents < or = 30 microA from a monopolar stimulating electrode placed into the contralateral posterior diencephalon. The mean +/- SE current for antidromic activation from these sites was 16 +/- 0.8 microA. These neurons were recorded in the superficial dorsal horn (4%), deep dorsal horn (89%), and intermediate zone and ventral horn (4%). 2. Systematic antidromic mapping techniques were used to map the axonal projections of 41 of these neurons within the diencephalon. Thirty-three neurons (80%) could be activated antidromically with currents < or = 30 microA only from points in the contralateral thalamus and are referred to as spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons. Eight neurons (20%) were activated antidromically with low currents from points in both the contralateral thalamus and hypothalamus, and these neurons are referred to as spinothalamic tract/ spinohypothalamic tract (STT/SHT) neurons. Three additional neurons were activated antidromically with currents < or = 30 microA only from points within the contralateral hypothalamus and are referred to as spinohypothalamic tract (SHT) neurons. The diencephalic projections of another 51 neurons were mapped incompletely. These neurons are referred to as spinothalamic/unknown (STT/ U) neurons to indicate that it was not known whether their axons ascended beyond the site in the thalamus from which they initially were activated antidromically. 3. For 31 STT neurons, the most anterior point at which antidromic activation was achieved with currents < or = 30 microA was determined. Fourteen (45%) were activated antidromically only from sites posterior to the ventrobasal complex (VbC) of the thalamus. Sixteen STT neurons (52%) were activated antidromically with low currents from sites at the level of the VbC, but not from more anterior levels. One STT neuron (3%) was activated antidromically from the anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus. 4. STT/SHT neurons were antidromically activated with currents < or = 30 microA from the medial lemniscus (ML), anterior pretectal nucleus (APt), posterior nuclear group and medial geniculate nucleus (Po/MG), and zona incerta in the thalamus and from the optic tract (OT), supraoptic decussation, or lateral area of the hypothalamus. No differences in the sites in the thalamus from which STT and STT/SHT neurons were activated antidromically were apparent. Five STT/SHT neurons (62%) were activated antidromically from points in the thalamus in the posterior diencephalon and from points in the hypothalamus at more anterior levels. Three STT/SHT neurons (38%) were activated antidromically with currents < or = 30 microA from sites in both the thalamus and hypothalamus at the same anterior-posterior level of the diencephalon. All three of these STT/SHT neurons projected to the intralaminar nuclei (parafascicular or central lateral nuclei) of the thalamus. 5. Seven STT/SHT neurons were tested for additional projections to the ipsilateral brain. Two (29%) were activated antidromically with currents < or = 30 microA and at longer latencies from sites in the ipsilateral diencephalon. One could only be activated antidromically from the hypothalamus ipsilaterally. The other was activated antidromically at progressively increasing latencies from points in the ipsilateral brain that extended as far posteriorly as the posterior pole of the MG. 6.

One day after induction of monoarthritis by an intra-articular injection of killed Mycobacterium butyricum (in complete Freund's adjuvant) there were numerous c-Fos labelled cells in the ipsilateral dorsal horn, and bilaterally in lamina VIII and in other areas of the ventral horn. Four weeks after induction of the arthritis, although marked inflammation of the ankle was still present, all the expression of c-Fos had returned to the basal levels. One hour after formalin stimulation of the ankle or hindpaw skin of normal rats expression of c-Fos was observed throughout the ipsilateral, but not contralateral dorsal horn.

In addition, c-Fos expression was induced in the contralateral deep, but not superficial laminae, at a density similar to that produced ipsilaterally by formalin stimulation of the ankle of normal rats. Formalin stimulation of the contralateral ankle in monoarthritic rats (i.e. the non-inflamed ankle) induced an ipsilateral expression of c-Fos which was similar to that observed after stimulation of the arthritic ankle. This stimulation of the normal ankle also resulted in an expression of c-Fos in the contralateral deep, but not superficial laminae, that was similar to that induced ipsilaterally by stimulation of the arthritic ankle. Finally, formalin stimulation of the hindpaw skin (which was not inflamed) of the arthritic limb induced the same number of c-Fos labelled cells in the superficial laminae as did formalin stimulation of the skin of normal rats; but in the deep laminae there was a 1.6-fold increase in the number of labelled cells.

Tremor was also present in his right hand. His daily life was independent as a otorhinolaryngologist. He visited our clinic on March 24, 1977 when he was mentally sound and showed mild parkinsonism consisting of masked face, stooped posture, small step gait, bradykinesia, and right side dominant rigidity and tremor. He showed good response to trihexyphenidyl and amantadine HCl. Two month later, he developed dyskinesia and some worsening of parkinsonism, and was admitted to our hospital for the first time. He was treated with 400 to 600 mg/day of levodopa/ carbidopa. He showed marked improvement, however, dyskinesia remained in his mouth. He was doing well until 77 years of age (June of 1993) when he developed hallucination and motor fluctuations. He was admitted again to our hospital on June 22, 1993. On admission, he was alert and appeared mentally sound. However, Hasegawa dementia scale was 18/30. Upward gaze was slightly restricted (3/5). Voice was somewhat small but no masking was noted. His posture was stooped and the gait was of small step. Dyskinesia was noted during walk. No rigidity nor tremor was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were lost but no sensory loss or motor weakness was noted. Routine laboratory studies were unremarkable. A cranial CT scan revealed only mild to moderate cortical atrophy. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits, however, motor action potentials could not be obtained with stimulation to the right common peroneal nerve. He was treated with 600 mg/day of levodopa with carbidopa, 100 mg of amantadine HCl, 300 mg of Dops, and 25 mg of tiapride. He continued to show motor fluctuations, and was discharged on July 23, 1993. Since then his motor functions had become progressively worse with frequent falls, but he was still able to walk without support. On October 3 of 1994, he went to bed as usual. On the next morning, he was found dead in his bed at 9: 30. The patient was discussed in neurological CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had young-onset Parkinson's disease with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra.

Macroscopically, the external appearance of the brain was unremarkable except for slight frontal atrophy. The substantia nigra showed depigmentation in the lateral part, but the pigmentation of the medial part was well preserved. Upon histologic examination, the number of pigmented neurons in the dorsomedial part was well preserved. In the lateral part, pigmented neurons were well preserved in the dorsal area, however, in the ventral area, only non-pigmented neurons were seen; they appeared to be neurons in the pars reticulata. No gliosis was seen in any of the nigral areas. No Lewy bodies were seen in the remaining neurons. So-called immature neurons with rounded shape without neuromelanin could not be detected. The locus coeruleus neurons were well preserved. The putamen and the other basal ganglia structures were also intact. Slight myelin pallor was noted in the subcortical white matter, however, otherwise cerebral cortices were normal. The histology of this patient is unique in that only the ventrolateral part of the substantia nigra showed abnormal finding consisting of lack of pigmented neurons without gliosis. It is not clear whether the nigral change represents degeneration or a congenital \"hypoplasia'. To our knowledge, such a unique pathology of the substantia nigra has not been reported in the literature.

For example, selective lesions (permanent or reversible) of the cerebellum block both acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning. Correspondingly, electrophysiological and brain-imaging studies indicate learning-related plasticity in the cerebellum. The involvement of the cerebellum in eyeblink conditioning is also supported by stimulation studies showing that direct stimulation of the two major afferents to the cerebellum (the mossy fibers emanating from the pontine nucleus and climbing fibers originating from the inferior olive) can substitute for the peripheral conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US), respectively, to yield normal behavioral learning. In the present study, we examined the relative contribution of the cerebellar cortex versus deep nuclei (specifically the interpositus nucleus) in eyeblink learning by using mutant mice deficient of Purkinje cells, the exclusive output neurons of the cerebellar cortex. We report that Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice exhibit a profound impairment in the acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning in comparison with their wild-type littermates. Nevertheless, the pcd animals did acquire a subnormal level of conditioned eyeblink responses. In contrast, wild-type mice with lesions of the interpositus nucleus were completely unable to learn the conditioned eyeblink response. These results suggest that both cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei are important for normal eyeblink conditioning.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "710", "title": "Spinal release of immunoreactive dynorphin A(1-8) with the development of peripheral inflammation in the rat.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "9134980", "authors": ["Riley, RC", "Zhao, ZQ", "Duggan, AW"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The synchronization of fast (mainly 30 to 40 Hz) oscillations in intrathalamic and thalamocortical (TC) networks of cat was studied under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia and in behaving animals by means of field potential, extra- and intracellular recordings from multiple sites in the thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus, dorsal (sensory, motor, and intralaminar) thalamic nuclei, and related neocortical areas. Far from being restricted to tonically activated behavioral states, the fast oscillations also appeared during resting sleep and deep anesthesia, when they occurred over the depolarizing component of the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation and were suppressed during the prolonged hyper-polarizations of RE, TC, and cortical neurons. The synchronization of fast rhythms among different thalamic foci was robust. Fast rhythmic cortical waves and subthreshold depolarizing potentials in TC neurons were highly coherent; however, the synchronization of the fast oscillation required recordings from reciprocally related neocortical and thalamic foci, as identified by monosynaptic responses in both directions. The short-range spatial confinement of coherent fast rhythms contrasted with the large-scale synchronization of low-frequency sleep rhythms. Transient fast rhythms, appearing over the depolarizing envelope of the slow sleep oscillation, became sustained when brain activation was elicited by stimulation of mesopontine cholinergic nuclei or during brain-active behavioral states in chronic experiments. These data demonstrate that fast rhythms are part of the background electrical activity of the brain and that desynchronization, used to designate brain-active states, is an erroneous term inasmuch as the fast oscillations are synchronized not only in intracortical but also in intrathalamic and TC networks.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "75", "title": "Presynaptic GABAB receptors modulate IPSPs evoked in neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei in vitro.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "9426872", "authors": ["Mouginot, D", "G\u00e4hwiler, BH"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Olfactory stimulation evokes a column of activity within the olfactory bulb extending from the glomerular layer to the granule cell layer that can be visualized with 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, optical imaging, Fos protein immunohistochemistry and c-fos mRNA in situ hybridization.

The fast oscillations also appear during the sleep-like EEG patterns of ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, but they are selectively suppressed during the prolonged phase of the slow (<1-Hz) sleep oscillation that is associated with hyperpolarization of cortical neurons. The fast (30- to 40-Hz) rhythms are synchronized intracortically within vertical columns, among closely located cortical foci, and through reciprocal corticothalamic networks. The fast oscillations do not reverse throughout the depth of the cortex. This aspect stands in contrast with the conventional depth profile of evoked potentials and slow sleep oscillations that display opposite polarity at the surface and midlayers. Current-source-density analyses reveal that the fast oscillations are associated with alternating microsinks and microsources across the cortex, while the evoked potentials and the slow oscillation display a massive current sink in midlayers, confined by two sources in superficial and deep layers.

Field potentials were recorded in the granule cell layer of superfused hemibrain preparations, and the amplitude of the large positive peak was compared following stimulation of the olfactory nerve (ON) and lateral olfactory tract (OT). In preparations superfused with normal amphibian Ringer's solution, the large peak occurred 14-21 ms after either ON or OT stimulation. It therefore appeared to reflect the activation of granule cell synapses with mitral cells, as in olfactory bulbs of other species. In three groups of preparations that were superfused with single concentrations of DA, significant decreases were observed in the amplitude of the large peak of ON- and OT-evoked potentials with increases in concentration from 5-200 microM. Moreover, with 5 microM DA and 50 microM DA, significant decreases were observed in the amplitude of the large peak of ON-evoked potentials with increases in superfusion time from 1-15 min. With each DA concentration tested, the mean percentage decrease in the ON-evoked potentials was significantly larger than the mean percentage decrease in the OT-evoked potentials. In five groups of preparations that were superfused with single concentrations of FLU, significant decreases were also observed in the amplitude of the large peak of ON- and OT-evoked potentials with increases in concentration from 0.5-150 microM. With 100 microM FLU and 150 microM FLU, significant decreases were observed in the amplitude of the large peak of both ON- and OT-evoked potentials with increases in superfusion time from 5-10 min. With each FLU concentration tested, the mean percentage change in the ON-evoked potentials was significantly larger than the mean percentage change in the OT-evoked potentials. The stronger effects of DA and FLU on the ON-evoked than OT-evoked potentials suggested that both drugs target receptors in the rostral (superficial) layers of the salamander olfactory bulb which have a higher density or affinity for DA and FLU than receptors in the more caudal (deep) layers of the bulb. When preparations were superfused with an equimolar mixture of DA and FLU at the ED50 concentrations (50 microM for both), FLU blocked approximately 50% of the decrease in the amplitude of the ON-evoked potentials relative to the decrease measured in preparations superfused with DA alone. Since FLU depressed the amplitude of ON-evoked potentials when it was tested alone, however, the rostral DA receptors could occur on both the olfactory receptor cell axons and their postsynaptic targets, or FLU could limit mitral/tufted cell excitation by affecting other types of receptors or voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Results of this study which show that DA and FLU reduce the amplitude of evoked potentials in the salamander olfactory bulb provide evidence for the occurrence of DA receptors in the amphibian brain. More importantly, the stronger effects of DA and FLU on the ON-evoked than OT-evoked potentials suggest that the DA receptors could function to limit the excitation of cells at an early synaptic level in the salamander bulb. By modulating spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic activity in the glomerular layer, the receptors could profoundly influence the initial encoding of information about odors.", "pages": "316-30"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "[Peroperative risks in cerebral aneurysm surgery].", "issue": "3", "pmid": "9108215", "authors": ["Mustaki, JP", "Bissonnette, B", "Archer, D", "Boulard, G", "Ravussin, P"], "year": "1996", "journal": "Annales fran\u00e7aises d'anesth\u00e8sie et de r\u00e8animation", "abstract": "This paper reports the occurrence of monosynaptic connections between dorsal root afferents and a distinct cell type-the giant neuron-deep in the dorsal horn of the turtle spinal cord. Light microscope studies combining Nissl stain and transganglionic HRP-labeling of the primary afferents have revealed the occurrence of axosomatic and axodendritic contacts between labeled boutons and giant neurons. The synaptic nature of these contacts has been confirmed by use of electron microscope procedures involving the partial three-dimensional reconstruction of identified giant neurons. Intracellular recording in spinal cord slices provided functional evidence indicating the monosynaptic connections between dorsal root afferents and giant neurons. The recorded neurons were morphologically identified by means of biocytin injection and with avidin conjugates. Electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral dorsal roots evoked synaptic responses with short, fixed latencies (1.6-5.6 ms), which remained unchanged at high frequencies (10 Hz). Excitatory polysynaptic potentials were also observed. By means of pharmacological procedures the short-latency response was dissected in two components: one insensitive to tetrodotoxin, the other abolished by the drug. The toxin-resistant component was presumed to be sustained by small-diameter C fibers.

Although 1 patient had increased ratings of laser pulse sensation, the amplitude of the LEP was always reduced on the side of increased pain or heat threshold in these CPS patients (Fisher exact test: P = 0.015).
