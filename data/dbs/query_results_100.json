The creation of the Kl\u00fcver-Bucy syndrome in monkeys opened new horizons in the pursuit of knowledge in human behavior and neuropathology. In the 1950s specialized functional neurosurgery was developed in association with stereotactic neurosurgery; deep brain electrodes were implanted for more precise recording of brain electrical activity in the evaluation and treatment of intractable mental disorders, including schizophrenia, \"pathologic aggression,\" and psychomotor seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy.

Nevertheless, the exact anatomical location of the electrode contacts used for chronic stimulation is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the existing literature on this issue. METHOD: We searched for studies on the anatomical location of active contacts published until December 2012. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies, published between 2002 and 2010, including 260 patients and 466 electrodes. One hundred and sixty-four active contacts (35\u00a0%) were identified within the STN, 117 (25\u00a0%) at the interface between STN and the surrounding structures, 184 (40\u00a0%) above the STN and one within the substantia nigra. We observed great discrepancies between the different series. The contra-lateral improvement was between 37 and 78.5\u00a0% for contacts located within the STN, between 48.6 and 73\u00a0% outside the STN, between 65.3 and 66\u00a0% at the interface. The authors report no clear correlation between anatomical location and stimulation parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative analysis of the anatomical location of active contacts is difficult, and all the methods used are debatable. The relationship between the anatomical location of active contacts and the clinical effectiveness of stimulation is unclear. It would be necessary to take into account the volume of the electrode contacts and the diffusion of the stimulation. We can nevertheless assume that the interface between dorso-lateral STN, zona incerta and Forel's fields could be directly involved in the effects of stimulation.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "", "title": "[From shock therapies to new neuromodulation techniques].", "issue": "286", "pmid": "11921113", "authors": ["Plaze, M", "Krebs, MO"], "year": "", "journal": "Soins. Psychiatrie", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The subcallosal cingulate and adjacent ventromedial prefrontal cortex (collectively referred to here as the subcallosal cortex or SCC) have been identified as key brain areas in emotional processing. The SCC's role in affective valuation as well as severe mood and motivational disturbances, such as major depression, has been largely inferred from measures of neuronal population activity using functional neuroimaging. On the basis of imaging studies, it is unclear whether the SCC predominantly processes 1) negatively valenced affective content, 2) affective arousal, or 3) category-specific affective information. METHODS: To clarify these putative functional roles of the SCC, we measured single neuron activity in the SCC of 15 human subjects undergoing deep brain stimulation for depression while they viewed emotionally evocative images grouped into categories that varied in emotional valence (pleasantness) and arousal. RESULTS: We found that the majority of responsive neurons were modulated by specific emotion categories, rather than by valence or arousal alone. Moreover, although these emotion-category-specific neurons responded to both positive and negative emotion categories, a significant majority were selective for negatively valenced emotional content. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that single SCC neuron activity reflects the automatic valuational processing and implicit emotion categorization of visual stimuli. Furthermore, because of the predominance of neuronal signals in SCC conveying negative affective valuations and the increased activity in this region among depressed people, the effectiveness of depression therapies that alter SCC neuronal activity may relate to the down-regulation of a previously negative emotional processing bias.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "136", "title": "Nigral stimulation for resistant axial motor impairment in Parkinson's disease?

This result differs from previous studies which reported a substantial cholinergic cell loss in the PPN of post-mortem PD brains and in 6-OHDA-lesioned monkeys.

Pain stimulation was applied both within an area of referred menstrual pain (lower back) and at a remote site outside of referred menstrual pain (forearm) in 12 healthy women with severe dysmenorrhea and 9 healthy women without dysmenorrhea, at 3 phases of the menstrual cycle: menstruation and follicular and luteal phases. Women rated their pain severity on a 100-mm visual analog scale every 30\u00a0seconds after injection until the pain subsided. In both groups of women, menstrual cycle phase had no effect on the reported intensity and duration of muscle pain. However, women with dysmenorrhea had increased sensitivity to experimental muscle pain both at the site of referred pain and at a remote nonpainful site, as assessed by peak pain severity visual analog scale rating, area under the visual analog scale curve, and pain duration, compared to women without dysmenorrhea. These data show that women with severe primary dysmenorrhea, who experience monthly menstrual pain, are hyperalgesic to deep muscle pain compared to women without dysmenorrhea.

Neurostimulation therapies are an open field in research for the treatment of TRD, involving the delivery of physical interventions either through electric current or a magnetic field to target selective or generalized brain regions. In this paper we review evidences for four brain-stimulation therapies, i.e. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), and we enlighten several new approaches regarding ECT, rTMS and epidural cortical stimulation (EpCS). ECT is the form of neurostimulation with the most extensive evidence, rTMS and VNS have a much smaller evidence base. There is emerging evidence that DBS is effective for otherwise TRD, but this is still an investigational approach. Other approaches are anecdotal reports. ECT and rTMS can be considered as a first-line treatment under specific circumstances. Evidence supporting VNS is less consistent and DBS remains an investigational treatment.

Like its medical counterpart, DBS is a highly personalized intervention that needs to be tailored to a patient's individual anatomy. And because of this, DBS like more conventional personalized medicine, can be highly specific where the object of care is an N\u00a0=\u00a01. But that is where the similarities end. Besides their differing medical and surgical provenances, these two varieties of personalized medicine have had strikingly different impacts. The molecular variant, though of a more recent vintage has thrived and is experiencing explosive growth, while DBS still struggles to find a sustainable therapeutic niche. Despite its promise, and success as a vetted treatment for drug resistant Parkinson's Disease, DBS has lagged in broadening its development, often encountering regulatory hurdles and financial barriers necessary to mount an adequate number of quality trials. In this paper we will consider why DBS-or better yet neuromodulation-has encountered these challenges and contrast this experience with the more successful advance of personalized medicine. We will suggest that personalized medicine and DBS's differential performance can be explained as a matter of timing and complexity. We believe that DBS has struggled because it has been a journey of scientific exploration conducted without a map. In contrast to molecular personalized medicine which followed the mapping of the human genome and the Human Genome Project, DBS preceded plans for the mapping of the human brain. We believe that this sequence has given personalized medicine a distinct advantage and that the fullest potential of DBS will be realized both as a cartographical or electrophysiological probe and as a modality of personalized medicine.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Accuracy of deep brain stimulation electrode placement using intraoperative computed tomography without microelectrode recording.", "issue": "", "pmid": "22503538", "authors": ["Burchiel, KJ", "McCartney, S", "Lee, A", "Raslan, AM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Primary myoclonus-dystonia is a childhood-onset autosomal-dominant movement disorder with myoclonic jerks and dystonia.

The etiology can be epileptic, postencephalitic, or posttraumatic, or the condition can be caused by brain malformations or perinatal insults. Erethism is often refractory to medication, and patients must often be interned in institutions, where they are managed with major restraining measures. The hypothalamus is a crucial group of nuclei that coordinate behavioral and autonomic responses and play a central role in the control of aggressive behavior. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posteromedial hypothalamus (PMH) has been proposed as a treatment for resistant erethism, although experience with this treatment around the world is scarce. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term outcome of PMH DBS in 6 patients with severe erethism treated at the authors' institution. Methods Medical records of 6 patients treated with PMH DBS for intractable aggressiveness were reviewed. The therapeutic effect on behavior was assessed by the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning preoperatively and at the last follow-up visit. Results Two patients died during the follow-up period due to causes unrelated to the neurosurgical treatment. Five of 6 patients experienced a significant reduction in aggressiveness (the mean Inventory for Client and Agency Planning general aggressiveness score was -47 at baseline and -25 at the last follow-up; mean follow-up 3.5 years). Similar responses were obtained with low- and high-frequency stimulation. In 4 cases, the patients' sleep patterns became more regular, and in 1 case, binge eating and polydipsia ceased.

RESULTS: Four cases (0.8% per lead, 1.3% per patient) of symptomatic cerebral venous infarction were identified out of 500 DBS lead implantation procedures between July 2002 and August 2009. All four patients had Parkinson's disease. Their DBS leads were implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (n = 2), and the globus pallidus internus (n = 2).

Recently, the mean 3-D Morel-Atlas of the basal ganglia and the thalamus was introduced. It combines information contained in histological data from ten post-mortem brains. We were interested whether the Morel-Atlas is applicable for the visualization of stimulation sites. METHODS: In a consecutive PD patient series, we documented preoperative MRI planning, intraoperative target adjustment based on electrophysiological and neurological testing, and perioperative CT target reconstruction. The localization of the DBS electrodes and the optimal stimulation sites were projected onto the Morel-Atlas. RESULTS: We included 20 patients (median age 62 years). The active contact had mean coordinates Xlat\u2009=\u2009\u00b112.1\u00a0mm, Yap\u2009=\u2009-1.8\u00a0mm, Zvert\u2009=\u2009-3.2\u00a0mm. There was a significant difference between the initially planned site and the coordinates of the postoperative active contact site (median 2.2\u00a0mm). The stimulation site was, on average, more anterior and more dorsal. The electrode contact used for optimal stimulation was found within the STN of the atlas in 38/40 (95\u00a0%) of implantations. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of stimulation sites in individual patients-as deduced from preoperative MR, intraoperative electrophysiology and neurological testing-showed a high degree of congruence with the atlas.

Electrode implant locations were the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM), globus pallidus internus (GPI), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 25, 23, and 12 patients, respectively. Target accuracy measurements were as follows: mean vector error 1.59 \u00b1 1.11 mm and mean deviation off trajectory 1.24 \u00b1 0.87 mm. There was no statistically significant difference between the accuracy of left and right brain electrodes. There was a statistically significant (negative) correlation between the distance of the closest approach of the electrode trajectory to the ventricular wall of the lateral ventricle and vector error (r(2) = -0.339, p < 0.05, n = 76), and the deviation from the planned trajectory (r(2) = -0.325, p < 0.05, n = 77). Furthermore, when the distance from the electrode trajectory and the ventricular wall was < 4 mm, the correlation of the ventricular distance to the deviation from the planned trajectory was stronger (r(2) = -0.419, p = 0.05, n = 19). Electrodes placed in the GPI were significantly more accurate than those placed in the VIM (p < 0.05). Only 1 of 119 electrodes required intraoperative replacement due to a vector error > 3 mm. In this series there was one infection and no intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Conclusions Placement of DBS electrodes using an intraoperative CT scanner and the NexFrame achieves an accuracy that is at least comparable to other methods.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Authenticity and autonomy in deep-brain stimulation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "16176368", "authors": ["Wardrope, A"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of medical ethics", "abstract": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) near the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has been posited to improve medication-intractable gait and balance problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, clinical studies evaluating this DBS target have not demonstrated consistent therapeutic effects, with several studies reporting the emergence of paresthesia and oculomotor side effects. The spatial and pathway-specific extent to which brainstem regions are modulated during PPN-DBS is not well understood. Approach. Here, we describe two computational models that estimate the direct effects of DBS in the PPN region for human and translational non-human primate (NHP) studies. The three-dimensional models were constructed from segmented histological images from each species, multi-compartment neuron models and inhomogeneous finite element models of the voltage distribution in the brainstem during DBS. Main Results. The computational models predicted that: (1) the majority of PPN neurons are activated with\u00a0-3\u00a0V monopolar cathodic stimulation; (2) surgical targeting errors of as little as 1\u00a0mm in both species decrement activation selectivity; (3) specifically, monopolar stimulation in caudal, medial, or anterior PPN activates a significant proportion of the superior cerebellar peduncle (up to 60% in the human model and 90% in the NHP model at\u00a0-3\u00a0V); (4) monopolar stimulation in rostral, lateral or anterior PPN activates a large percentage of medial lemniscus fibers (up to 33% in the human model and 40% in the NHP model at\u00a0-3\u00a0V) and (5) the current clinical cylindrical electrode design is suboptimal for isolating the modulatory effects to PPN neurons.

A region of the midbrain, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), has long been implicated in the control of urgent, survival-related behaviours. To test for PAG involvement in the processing of infant vocalizations, we recorded local field potentials from macroelectrodes implanted in this region in four adults who had undergone deep brain stimulation. We found a significant difference occurring as early as 49 ms after hearing a sound in activity recorded from the PAG in response to infant vocalizations compared with constructed control sounds and adult and animal affective vocalizations. This difference was not present in recordings from thalamic electrodes implanted in three of the patients. Time frequency analyses revealed distinct patterns of activity in the PAG for infant vocalisations, constructed control sounds and adult and animal vocalisations. These results suggest that human infant vocalizations can be discriminated from other emotional or acoustically similar sounds early in the auditory pathway.

As an alternative, the auditory midbrain implant (AMI) has been developed and implanted into deaf patients. Consisting of a single-shank array, the AMI is designed for stimulation along the tonotopic gradient of the inferior colliculus (ICC). Although the AMI can provide frequency cues, it appears to insufficiently transmit temporal cues for speech understanding because repeated stimulation of a single site causes strong suppressive and refractory effects. Applying the electrical stimulation to at least two sites within an isofrequency lamina can circumvent these refractory processes. Moreover, co-activation with short inter-site delays (<5 ms) can elicit cortical activation which is enhanced beyond the summation of activity induced by the individual sites. The goal of our study was to further investigate the role of the auditory cortex in this enhancement effect. In guinea pigs, we electrically stimulated two locations within an ICC lamina or along different laminae with varying inter-pulse intervals (0-10 ms) and recorded activity in different locations and layers of primary auditory cortex (A1). Our findings reveal a neural mechanism that integrates activity only from neurons located within the same ICC lamina for short spiking intervals (<6 ms). This mechanism leads to enhanced activity into layers III-V of A1 that is further magnified in supragranular layers. This integration mechanism may contribute to perceptual coding of different sound features that are relevant for improving AMI performance.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Thalamic modulation of cingulate seizure activity via the regulation of gap junctions in mice thalamocingulate slice.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "16629764", "authors": ["Chang, WP", "Wu, JJ", "Shyu, BC"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems could provide automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters and improve outcomes in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. The evoked compound action potential (ECAP), generated by activated neurons near the DBS electrode, may provide a suitable feedback control signal for closed-loop DBS. The objectives of this work were to characterize the ECAP across stimulation parameters and determine the neural elements contributing to the signal. We recorded ECAPs during thalamic DBS in anesthetized cats and conducted computer simulations to calculate the ECAP of a population of thalamic neurons. The experimental and computational ECAPs were similar in shape and had characteristics that were correlated across stimulation parameters (R(2)=0.80-0.95, P<0.002). The ECAP signal energy increased with larger DBS amplitudes (P<0.0001) and pulse widths (P<0.002), and the signal energy of secondary ECAP phases was larger at 10 Hz than 100 Hz DBS (P<0.002). The computational model indicated that these changes resulted from a greater extent of neural activation and an increased synchronization of post-synaptic thalamocortical activity, respectively. Administration of tetrodotoxin, lidocaine, or isoflurane abolished or reduced the magnitude of the experimental and computational ECAPs, glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX and APV reduced secondary ECAP phases by decreasing post-synaptic excitation, and the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol increased the latency of the secondary phases by augmenting post-synaptic hyperpolarization.

However, evoked-pain connectivity studies have employed cutaneous and/or brief stimuli, which induce sensations that differ appreciably from the clinical pain experience. Sustained myofascial pain evoked by pressure cuff affords an excellent opportunity to evaluate functional connectivity change to more clinically relevant sustained deep-tissue pain. Connectivity in specific networks known to be modulated by evoked pain (sensorimotor, salience, dorsal attention, frontoparietal control, and default mode networks: SMN, SLN, DAN, FCN, and DMN) was evaluated with functional-connectivity magnetic resonance imaging, both at rest and during a sustained (6-minute) pain state in healthy adults. We found that pain was stable, with no significant changes of subjects' pain ratings over the stimulation period. Sustained pain reduced connectivity between the SMN and the contralateral leg primary sensorimotor (S1/M1) representation. Such SMN-S1/M1 connectivity decreases were also accompanied by and correlated with increased SLN-S1/M1 connectivity, suggesting recruitment of activated S1/M1 from SMN to SLN. Sustained pain also increased DAN connectivity to pain processing regions such as mid-cingulate cortex, posterior insula, and putamen. Moreover, greater connectivity during pain between contralateral S1/M1 and posterior insula, thalamus, putamen, and amygdala was associated with lower cuff pressures needed to reach the targeted pain sensation. These results demonstrate that sustained pain disrupts resting S1/M1 connectivity by shifting it to a network known to process stimulus salience.

Patients were assessed 1 month before device implantation (T0), at 8 months of active stimulation (T1) and at 3-5 years of active stimulation (T2). QOL was measured with the WHO Quality of Life Scale-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) that covers physical, psychological, social and environmental domains. The study was conducted between April 2005 and January 2011 at the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. RESULTS: At T1 and T2, we found significant improvement (p<0.05) in the general score and in the physical, psychological and environmental domains of WHOQOL-BREF. Between T1 and T2, the physical and psychological domains improved further (p<0.05). At T2, the general score improved by a total of 90%, the physical and psychological domains both improved by 39.5% and the environmental domain improved by 16%. The social domain did not change between baseline and follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: In line with symptom improvement, patient's QOL improved in the general score and in three of the four WHOQOL-BREF domains. This suggests that the improvement caused by DBS is not limited to symptom reduction alone, but also has a positive influence on patients' perception of their physical, psychological, environmental and global QOL.

METHODS: PD patients were prospectively examined before and 3 months after surgery. Semistructured interviews regarding preoperative expectations and postsurgical subjective perceived outcome were conducted. These were analysed using content analysis. For statistical analyses, patients were classified according to their subjective perceived outcome, resulting in three different subjective outcome groups (negative, mixed, positive outcome). The groups were used for multiple comparisons between and within each group regarding motor impairment, quality of life (QoL), neuropsychiatric status and cognitive functioning, using standard instruments. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to find predictors of subjective negative outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyse cut-off scores for predictive tests. RESULTS: Of the 30 PD patients participating, 8 had a subjective negative outcome, 8 a mixed and 14 a positive outcome. All groups significantly improved in motor functioning. Patients with subjective negative outcome were characterised by preoperative unrealistic expectations, no postsurgical improvement in QoL, and significantly higher presurgical and postsurgical apathy and depression scores. Higher preoperative apathy and depression scores were significant predictors of negative subjective outcome. Cut-off scores for apathy and depression were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed-method approach proved useful in examining a patient's subjective perception of STN-DBS outcome.

Initial studies reported a significant early improvement in patients, followed by a decline within the first month of treatment, an unexpected phenomenon attributed to potential placebo effects or a physiological response to probe insertion that remains poorly understood. Here we characterized the behavioural antidepressant-like effect of DBS in the rat medial prefrontal cortex, focusing on modifications to rodent SCG correlate (prelimbic and infralimbic (IL) cortex). In addition, we evaluated the early outcome of DBS in the SCG of eight patients with resistant MDD involved in a clinical trial. We found similar antidepressant-like effects in rats implanted with electrodes, irrespective of whether they received electrical brain stimulation or not. This effect was due to regional inflammation, as it was temporally correlated with an increase of glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein immunoreactivity, and it was blocked by anti-inflammatory drugs. Indeed, inflammatory mediators and neuronal p11 expression also changed. Furthermore, a retrospective study indicated that the early response of MDD patients subjected to DBS was poorer when they received anti-inflammatory drugs. Our study demonstrates that electrode implantation up to the IL cortex is sufficient to produce an antidepressant-like effect of a similar magnitude to that observed in rats receiving brain stimulation. Moreover, both preclinical and clinical findings suggest that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs after electrode implantation may attenuate the early anti-depressive response in patients who are subjected to DBS.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 28 May 2013; doi:10.1038/mp.2013.63.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Initial cognitive dip after subthalamic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17143881", "authors": ["Kim, HJ", "Jeon, BS", "Yun, JY", "Kim, YE", "Yang, HJ", "Paek, SH"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Sequential behavior characterizes both simple everyday tasks, such as getting dressed, and complex skills, such as music performance.

We demonstrated an anticipatory modulation of pallidal beta-band neuronal oscillations that was specific to sequence boundaries, as compared to within-sequence elements, and independent of both the movement parameters and the initiation/termination of ongoing movement. The modulation at sequence boundaries emerged with training, in parallel with skill learning, and correlated with the degree of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in the dynamics of ongoing beta-band amplitude oscillations.

Its pathophysiology is poorly known, yet several neurotransmitter systems and brain areas have been implicated. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are most used antidepressant treatments. However, these drugs show slow onset of action and limited efficacy, making necessary the use of drug augmentation strategies or more aggressive interventions. Two important observations have emerged in recent years indicating that more rapid and effective antidepressant treatments are possible. Hence, the deep brain stimulation (DBS) of ventral anterior (subgenual) cingulate cortex (Cg25) evokes rapid mood improvements in subgroups of treatment-resistant depressive patients, likely mediated by a functional remodelling of cortico-limbic circuits. On the other hand, the non-competitive NDMA receptor antagonist ketamine can also evoke rapid (e.g., 2h) and persistent (up to 1wk) improvements in some treatment-resistant patients.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the rationale, methods and progress for each of these. LATEST FINDINGS: Results from a randomized, controlled trial investigating sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation have just been published. Reportedly the surgery is relatively simple and it is apparently the only therapy that provides relief acutely. SUMMARY: The rationale behind these therapies is based on growing evidence from clinical, hormonal and neuroimaging studies. The overall results are encouraging, but unfortunately not all patients have benefited. All the mentioned therapies require weeks to months of stimulation for a prophylactic effect to occur, suggesting brain plasticity as a possible mechanism, and only stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion has demonstrated an acute, abortive effect. Predictors of effect for all modes of neurostimulation still need to be identified and in the future, the least invasive and most effective strategy must be preferred as first-line therapy for intractable chronic cluster headache.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Stimulation of subthalamic nuclei restores a near normal planning strategy in Parkinson's patients.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "20585762", "authors": ["Mirabella, G", "Iaconelli, S", "Modugno, N", "Giannini, G", "Lena, F", "Cantore, G"], "year": "2013", "journal": "PloS one", "abstract": "To explore whether experiencing inflammatory pain has an impact upon intracortical synaptic organization, the planar multi-electrode array (MEA) technique and 2-dimensional current source density (2D-CSD) imaging were used in slice preparations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) from rats. Synaptic activity across different layers of the ACC was evoked by deep layer stimulation through one electrode. The layer-localization of both local field potentials (LFPs) and the spread of current sink calculated by 2D-CSD analysis was characterized pharmacologically. Moreover, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and changes in LTP magnitude were also evaluated. We found that under na\u00efve conditions, the current sink was initially generated in layer VI, then spread to layer V and finally confined to layers II-III. This spatial pattern of current sink movement typically reflected changes in depolarized sites from deep layers (V-VI) to superficial layers (II-III) where intra- and extracortical inputs terminate. In the ACC slices from rats in an inflamed state (for 2 h) caused by intraplantar bee-venom injection, the spatial profile of intra-ACC synaptic organization was significantly changed, showing an enlarged current sink distribution and a leftward shift of the stimulus-response curves relative to the na\u00efve and saline controls. The change was more distinct in the superficial layers (II-III) than in the deep site. In terms of temporal properties, the rate of LTP induction was significantly increased in layers II-III by inflammatory pain. However, the magnitude of LTP was not significantly enhanced by this treatment. Taken together, these results show that inflammatory pain results in distinct spatial and temporal plasticity of synaptic organization in the ACC, which may lead to altered synaptic transmission and modulation.", "pages": "75"}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Confocal microscopy for astrocyte in vivo imaging: Recycle and reuse in microscopy.", "issue": "", "pmid": "20921515", "authors": ["P\u00e9rez-Alvarez, A", "Araque, A", "Mart\u00edn, ED"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tongue protrusion dystonia can cause difficulty with speech, mastication, breathing, and swallowing. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is a widespread therapeutic alternative for treating medically refractory dystonia. To our knowledge, detailed reports regarding DBS for tongue protrusion dystonia are rare. In this report, we describe two patients with \"sticking out\" tongue protrusion who had undergone bilateral GPi DBS. METHODS: Operations were performed with surface electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, microelectrode recording, and macrostimulation to identify the point at which tongue kinetic cells respond most effectively. The most effective location for active contacts was identified according to burst EMG response in the posteroventral GPi. RESULTS: Two years after DBS, total Burke, Fahn, and Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale scores of two patients were improved from 12.5 to 1 (92.0%) and from 13 to 1 (92.3%), respectively. One 58-year-old woman who lost 7\u2009kg weight from not eating well improved enough to eat solid food and became free from choking. Another 54-year-old woman who had dysarthria and mumbled could speak more fluently and would not have complained difficulty in reading any more. CONCLUSION: Stimulation on posteroventral GPi for patients with idiopathic \"sticking-out\" tongue movement changes EMG pattern in orofacial muscles.

METHODS: Twenty-three patients were submitted to DBS-STN, and evaluated before and after surgery with respect to catecholamines and metabolites in 24-h urine measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. RESULTS: Of the 23 patients evaluated, a significant decrease of about 60% in the urinary excretion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA; in nmol/mg creatinine/24\u2005h) was observed 1\u2005week after DBS-STN. Moreover, in 17 patients with a follow-up of 8 weeks after surgery, there was a further 50% decrease in urinary l-DOPA levels, dropping to about 75% of the values before surgery. There was also a significant decrease in dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels 1\u2005week after DBS-STN that was no longer present 8\u2005weeks after. A significant increase in the DA/l-DOPA ratio was observed 1\u2005week after surgery, with a further increase 8\u2005weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION: After DBS-STN, the DA/l-DOPA ratio, an indirect measure of DA synthesis, increased.

Although equally effective, deep brain stimulation is considered second-line treatment in cluster headache because of its potentially life-threatening side effects. Most recently, stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion has also been shown to effectively abort acute cluster headache attacks.
