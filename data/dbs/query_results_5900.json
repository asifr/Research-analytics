By voltage clamping dissociated rat STN neurons with their own firing patterns, we found that pacemaking is driven by two kinds of subthreshold sodium current: a steady-state \"persistent\" sodium current and a dynamic \"resurgent\" sodium current, which promotes rapid firing by flowing immediately after a spike. These currents are strongly regulated by a process of slow inactivation that is active at physiological firing frequencies. Slow inactivation of the pacemaking sodium currents promotes a constant frequency of tonic firing in the face of small, steady changes in input and constitutes a form of adaptation at the single-cell level. Driving cells at a high rate (75 Hz) produced pronounced slow inactivation (60%-70%) of resurgent, persistent, and transient components of sodium current. This inactivation is likely to contribute to effects of clinical deep-brain stimulation on STN excitability.", "pages": "109-20"}, {"volume": "50", "title": "Computation of electric and magnetic stimulation in human head using the 3-D impedance method.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "12848926", "authors": ["Nadeem, M", "Thorlin, T", "Gandhi, OP", "Persson, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "abstract": "A comparative, computational study of the modeling of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is presented using a human head model. The magnetic fields from a typical TMS coil of figure-eight type is modeled using the Biot-Savart law. The TMS coil is placed in a position used clinically for treatment of depression. Induced current densities and electric field distributions are calculated in the model using the impedance method. The calculations are made using driving currents and wave forms typical in the clinical setting. The obtained results are compared and contrasted with the corresponding ECT results. In the ECT case, a uniform current density is injected on one side of the head and extracted from the equal area on the opposite side of the head. The area of the injected currents corresponds to the electrode placement used in the clinic. The currents and electric fields, thus, produced within the model are computed using the same three-dimensional impedance method as used for the TMS case. The ECT calculations are made using currents and wave forms typical in the clinic. The electrical tissue properties are obtained from a 4-Cole-Cole model. The numerical results obtained are shown on a two-dimenaional cross section of the model.

AEEG remains an important tool in epilepsy evaluation. In the near future, smaller, faster, and more sophisticated AEEGs will be developed. Seizure detection/anticipation systems will allow the wearer to be forewarned of a seizure so that appropriate safety measures can be taken. With further refinement in our understanding of nonlinear dynamic analysis to define the pre-ictal state, AEEG will be coupled with an accurate seizure anticipation device in a closed-loop system, providing a time window during which therapeutic intervention can occur, to prevent a seizure. The therapeutic intervention will most likely involve vagus nerve or deep brain stimulation. An alternative is that the patient may learn to recognize early symptoms of the pre-ictal state and use behavioral biofeedback interventions to avoid a clinical seizure. In order to achieve convenient ambulatory recording and seizure detection that could realistically improve the lives of patients with refractory epilepsy, the process of miniaturization of such a device to a convenient size must be accomplished. One of the aspects of epilepsy that patients find most frustrating, and that most limits activities, is the vulnerability to sudden unexpected incapacitation due to the occurrence of a seizure. With miniaturization of AEEG and seizure anticipation technology, and advancements in our ability to identify the transition from pre-ictal to ictal state, there is realistic hope that patients with refractory epilepsy may gain control over their seizures and enjoy significantly improved quality of life.", "pages": "109-20"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Electrophysiology of sensory and sensorimotor processing in mice under general anesthesia.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "12845822", "authors": ["Ellrich, J", "Wesselak, M"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Brain research.

The in-vitro electrophysiological technique is well established in mice. The effect of manipulations of the mouse genome on neuronal systems and networks has to be investigated under in-vivo conditions. Thus, the step from the rat to the smaller mouse seems to be important in terms of progress in molecular neurobiology. So far, there is no published study of sensory processing by electrophysiological means in mice under controlled general anesthesia. In this paper we describe a technique for electrophysiological recordings of sensory and sensorimotor processing in anesthetized mice. The mouse is anesthetized by continuous administration of the short-acting general anesthetic methohexital sodium salt via the jugular vein and artificially ventilated via a tracheotomy. The electrocardiogram and the carotid artery blood pressure are monitored. The sensorimotor jaw-opening reflex and the hindpaw withdrawal reflex are elicited by electric stimulation of the tongue and the sole of the hindpaw, respectively. The jaw-opening reflex is inhibited by deep brain stimulation of the rostral ventromedial medulla. On- and off-cells of the rostral ventromedial medulla and sensory neurons of the spinal trigeminal nucleus are extracellularly recorded by tungsten electrodes. General anesthesia can be reliably induced, maintained and sufficiently controlled in mice.

One type consisted of pressor responses accompanied by bradycardia. Such responses were elicited from a region 0.4 mm caudal to 0.8 mm rostral to the calamus scriptorius (CS); maximum responses were elicited from a site 0.6 mm rostral to the CS, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline and 1.2 mm deep from the dorsal medullary surface.

Between January, 1998 and September, 2002, a total of 110 stereotactic surgeries for movement disorders (57 RF-coagulations and 53 implantations of DBS) were performed. We investigated the type and number of complications for each of the following surgical targets; globus pallidus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Twenty-four neurological complications in 22 patients and 16 radiological/instrumental complications in 16 patients were verified among the 110 surgeries. Among the neurological complications, hemiparesis and mental disturbances were observed at a high rate, while intraoperative hemorrhage frequently occurred among the radiological/instrumental complications. The rate of neurological and radiological/instrumental complications for each of the stereotactic targets; the globus pallidus, thalamus, and STN-targeted surgeries, was 32.4%, 16.7%, 18.8% and 16.2%, 20.0%, 12.5%, respectively. The reason for the high rate of intraoperative hemorrhage may be associated with technical problems resulting from the penetration of vessels by needles, as well as the destruction of small vessels due to heat ablation. As for the mental disturbances, visual hallucinations (VH) occurred a high rate, especially during STN-DBS. Peduncular damage and/or L-dopa toxicity due to STN-DBS may have been associated with VH, so the STN-DBS may therefore be thought to change the threshold of stimulus-induced hallucinations. We also found that the procedures for DBS surgery, especially in younger patients, have a lower risk of complication, while, on the other hand, coagulation surgery for elderly patients is accompanied by of high risks, from the standpoint of surgical complications.", "pages": "109-20"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Kinetics of the uptake and distribution of the dopamine D(2,3) agonist (R)-N-[1-(11)C]n-propylnorapomorphine in brain of healthy and MPTP-treated G\u00f6ttingen miniature pigs.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "12833872", "authors": ["Cumming, P", "Gillings, NM", "Jensen, SB", "Bjarkam, C", "Gjedde, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Nuclear medicine and biology", "abstract": "The binding of radioligand agonists to dopamine receptors in living brain can be informative about the abundance of receptors which are coupled to intracellular second messenger systems.

To evaluate this we have compared the contribution of the two ears in albino and normally pigmented guinea pigs to the spatial tuning of auditory neurons in the deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Broadband noise stimuli at threshold and at suprathreshold intensities were presented from different azimuthal loudspeaker locations under free-field anechoic conditions, and auditory receptive fields were plotted before, during and after occluding the ipsilateral ear. We show that the deep layers of the albino SC contain a map of contralateral auditory azimuth along its anteroposterior axis, which is aligned with the visual map in the superficial layers above, just as in normal animals. We also show that threshold spatial responses are elicited only via the contralateral ear and at similar stimulus intensities (mean approximately 30 dB SPL) in the two pigmentation phenotypes. The mechanisms that maintain spatial tuning at sound intensities of 10-40 dB above threshold, however, differ markedly in these animals. Plugging the ipsilateral ear in normal guinea pigs caused significant expansions of their auditory receptive fields and loss of directional tuning, but in the albinos occlusion had little effect on these spatial properties. The results suggest that while spatial selectivity for relatively loud sounds among SC neurons is normally maintained via the binaural combination of contralateral excitatory drive and ipsilateral inhibition, it is achieved in albinos almost exclusively by monaural input from the contralateral ear. This finding is consistent with an excessive contralateral ear dominance of higher levels of the albino auditory system caused by anomalies of their acoustic chiasm, analogous to the monocular dominance of the visual system that results from excessive axon crossing at the optic chiasm in these animals.", "pages": "109-20"}, {"volume": "28 Suppl 1", "title": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder: development of demand-controlled deep brain stimulation with methods from stochastic phase resetting.", "issue": "", "pmid": "12830342", "authors": ["Tass, PA", "Klosterk\u00f6tter, J", "Schneider, F", "Lenartz, D", "Koulousakis, A", "Sturm, V"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "Synchronization of neuronal firing is a hallmark of several neurological diseases.

Rest tremor in subjects with Parkinson's disease receiving HF-DBS was recorded continuously throughout switching the deep brain stimulator on (at an effective frequency) and off. These data suggest that the stimulation induces a qualitative change in the dynamics, called a Hopf bifurcation, so that the stable oscillations are destabilized. We hypothesize that the periodic stimulation modifies a parameter affecting the oscillation in a time dependent way and thereby induces a Hopf bifurcation. We explore this hypothesis using a schematic network model of an oscillator interacting with periodic stimulation. The mechanism of time-dependent change of a control parameter in the model captures two aspects of the dynamics observed in the data: (1) a gradual increase in tremor amplitude when the stimulation is switched off and a gradual decrease in tremor amplitude when the stimulation is switched on and (2) a time delay in the onset and offset of the oscillations. This mechanism is consistent with these rest tremor transition data and with the idea that HF-DBS acts via the gradual change of a network property.

The arms are the most common body part affected and cause the most functional disability. The treatment of essential tremor includes medications, surgical options and other forms of therapy. Presently there is no cure for essential tremor nor are there any medications that can slow the progression of tremor. Treatment for essential tremor is recommended if the tremor causes functional disability. If the tremor is disabling only during periods of stress and anxiety, propranolol and benzodiazepines can be used during those periods when the tremor causes functional disability. The currently available medications can improve tremor in approximately 50% of the patients. If the tremor is disabling, treatment should be initiated with either primidone or propranolol. If either primidone or propranolol do not provide adequate control of the tremor, then the medications can be used in combination. If patients experience adverse effects with propranolol, occasionally other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as atenolol or metoprolol) can be used. If primidone and propranolol do not provide adequate control of tremor, occasionally the use of benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) can provide benefit.

Botulinum toxin in the hand muscles for hand tremor can result in bothersome hand weakness and is not widely used. There are other medications that have been tried in essential tremor and have questionable efficacy. These drugs include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. methazolamide), phenobarbital, calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nimodipine), isoniazid, clonidine, clozapine and mirtazapine. If the patient still has disabling tremor after medication trials, surgical options are usually considered. Surgical options include thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. These surgical options provide adequate tremor control in approximately 90% of the patients. Surgical morbidity and mortality for these procedures is low. Deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy have been shown to have comparable efficacy but fewer complications have been reported with deep brain stimulation. In patients undergoing bilateral procedures deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is the procedure of choice to avoid adverse effects seen with bilateral ablative procedures. The use of medication and/or surgery can provide adequate tremor control in the majority of the patients.", "pages": "109-20"}, {"volume": "98", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for movement disorders: morbidity and mortality in 109 patients.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "12023409", "authors": ["Umemura, A", "Jaggi, JL", "Hurtig, HI", "Siderowf, AD", "Colcher, A", "Stern, MB", "Baltuch, GH"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).

To learn whether STN DBS also influences the limbic loop, we investigated acute subjective psychotropic effects related to levodopa or bilateral STN DBS. After a median postoperative follow-up of 12 months, 50 PD patients completed the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), assessing subjective psychotropic effects in four conditions: off-drug/on-stimulation; off-drug/off-stimulation; on-drug/off-stimulation; and on-drug/on-stimulation. Both levodopa and STN DBS improved all the ARCI subscales, indicating subjective feelings of well being, euphoria, increase in motivation, and decrease in fatigue, anxiety, and tension. A suprathreshold dose of levodopa was significantly more effective than STN DBS, using the same electrical parameters as for chronic stimulation, on four of the five ARCI subscales. We concluded that 1) both STN DBS and levodopa have synergistic acute beneficial psychotropic effects in PD, 2) the psychotropic effects of both treatments need to be considered in the long-term management of chronic STN DBS, and 3) the results indicate an involvement of the limbic STN in mood disorders of PD.", "pages": "109-20"}, {"volume": "158 Spec no 1", "title": "[Parkinson disease: deep cerebral stimulation].", "issue": "", "pmid": "12752397", "authors": ["Krack, P"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Revue neurologique", "abstract": "Clinical outcomes of Parkinson's disease patients treated for 12 months with STN-DBS were analyzed.

Post-operative high-resolution MRI was performed in each patient to confirm lesion location, and this was correlated with clinical outcome. There was improvement in contralateral tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia in all patients followed for 6, 12 and 24 months, with the effect on tremor being greatest. L-dopa equivalent daily intake was approximately halved, and this resulted in a significant reduction in dyskinesia. Psychometric test scores were mostly unchanged or improved.

Low-dose propofol in one other dystonia patient also seemed to suppress GPi firing. These results indicate that an abnormally low basal ganglia output is not the sine qua non of dystonia.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used only since a few years in dystonia patients. This review summarizes the available data on pallidal and thalamic DBS for various dystonic syndromes. The major advantage of DBS as compared to radiofrequency lesioning is that it allows performing contemporaneous bilateral surgery with relatively low morbidity in these patients. The posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been the preferred target in most instances, thus far. While phasic dystonic movements may improve early after surgery, the response of tonic dystonic movements to chronic stimulation may be delayed. The most beneficial results have been achieved in patients with primary genetic generalized and segmental dystonia, myoclonic dystonia, and complex cervical dystonia. Outcome has been varied in patients with other dystonic disorders, in particular those with secondary dystonia. Most studies have reported on relatively short follow-up periods, on single cases, or were retrospective. Pallidal DBS has been shown to be effective in complex cervical dystonia yielding both symptomatic and functional benefit for up to 2.5 years of follow-up. Dramatic improvement has been obtained in children and in adults with DYT1 positive dystonia. Also, patients with non DYT1 genetic dystonia achieved sustained benefit for up to 2 years of follow-up. Preliminary experience indicates that choreoathetosis in patients with cerebral palsy responds less well to pallidal DBS, and that it may not be effective at all in some patients. In single instances unilateral pallidal DBS has been shown to yield valuable benefit in patients with hemidystonia. The experience with DBS for treatment of Meige syndrome and other focal dystonias has been explored only recently. There is much less experience with thalamic DBS for dystonia. Thalamic DBS has been shown to be effective in single cases with posttraumatic dystonia, postanoxic dystonia and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dystonia.

In our center, a predominantly MRI-directed method has been developed for targeting the STN. The STN is localized on T2-weighted images from a 1.5-T MRI scanner. Long acquisition, high-resolution images are acquired in both the axial and coronal planes under strict stereotactic conditions with the patient under general anesthesia. The boundary of STN is co-registered in both planes to give optimal 3-dimensional target definition. Stereotactic coordinates of the dorsolateral STN are recorded and the trajectory is planned down the axis of the nucleus in the coronal plane. Initially, per-operative macrostimulation was used for adjustment at the target prior to unilateral subthalamotomy in 26 patients. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Assessments of the lesions in post-operative images confirmed successful localisation of the lesions within the dorsolateral STN in all of the remaining 21 cases. In a subsequent series of 19 patients treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS), unilateral in 1 patient and bilateral in 18, the STN was targeted using the same MRI-directed method, guide tubes and radio-opaque stylettes were implanted, and target verification was entirely MRI-based. Following implantation of the guide tubes and stylettes, assessments of the per-operative MRI images for the 37 STN targetings confirmed a mean target error, between the stylette and the desired target in the axial plane, of 0.3 mm mediolaterally (SD = 0.4) and 0.4 mm anteroposteriorly (SD = 0.4), with median errors of 0.5 mm. This study demonstrates that MRI-directed targeting of the STN through guide tubes is accurate, and allows direct verification and corrections as necessary. Cumulative frequencies predict that the majority of DBS electrodes placed in this manner will be within 0.5 mm of the planned target. Because physiological methods are not required, the whole procedure can be performed under general anesthesia.

Although both targets have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of the cardinal motor signs of PD, the STN has gained greater popularity and is now considered the site of choice by most centers performing these procedures. This preference stems predominately from the belief that STN DBS provides greater improvement in reducing the motor manifestations of PD and allows a reduction in dopaminergic medication not permitted with GPi DBS. There are, however, a number of issues that must be considered before abandoning GPi in favor of STN as the surgical target of choice for DBS. The maximal benefit reported for GPi stimulation is not significantly different than that reported for the STN, 67 versus 71%, and while reductions in medication are required with STN stimulation to avoid inducing dyskinesia, GPi stimulation may directly suppress dyskinesia obviating any need to reduce medication. As such, many centers may not attempt to reduce antiparkinsonian medication with GPi DBS. In addition, there are significantly more reports of changes in mood, behavior and a higher incidence of adverse events reported for STN stimulation. Most studies of DBS are nonrandomized, assessment protocols are not standardized, and lead locations are not reported. Thus, before drawing conclusions regarding the optimal site for DBS for advanced PD we must take a critical eye to the present data and address the outstanding questions that remain with well-designed clinical trials that evaluate motor, nonmotor and adverse events and address the above clinical variables by randomizing patients, using standardized methods of assessment and defining the lead location.", "pages": "109-20"}]
