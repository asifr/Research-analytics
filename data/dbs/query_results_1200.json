Saccadic and manual reaction times were measured under as nearly identical conditions as possible in six patients with implanted subthalamic electrodes and in six age-matched controls with the stimulation either on or off. Median latency was found to be reduced by stimulation in a similar way to saccadic latency; in neither case was there a significant change in the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergotic Rate parameter \u03c3. For both types of response, the effect is to move the responses proportionately in the direction of average of responses in the control group. We therefore conclude that the previously described effects of stimulation on latency are not a phenomenon peculiar to saccades, increasing confidence in using saccadic latency measurements as a surrogate for more general responses when determining the efficacy of deep brain stimulation.", "pages": "179-83"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Verbal fluency in patients receiving bilateral versus left-sided deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "22264411", "authors": ["Sj\u00f6berg, RL", "Lidman, E", "H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m, B", "Hariz, MI", "Linder, J", "Fredricks, A", "Blomstedt, P"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative effects of unilateral (left-sided) versus bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on verbal fluency.

However, its functional significance in motor performance is not yet well understood. Here, we assessed whether event-related \u03b3 synchronization (ERS) recorded from the globus pallidus internus in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for medically intractable primary focal and segmental dystonia might code specific motor parameters. Pallidal local field potentials were recorded in 22 patients during performance of a choice-reaction-time task. Movement amplitude of the forearm pronation-supination movements was parametrically modulated with an angular degree of 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0. Only patients with limbs not affected by dystonia were tested. A broad contralateral \u03b3 band (35-105 Hz) ERS occurred at movement onset with a maximum reached at peak velocity of the movement. The pallidal oscillatory \u03b3 activity correlated with movement parameters: the larger and faster the movement, the stronger was the synchronization in the \u03b3 band. In contrast, the event-related decrease in beta band activity was similar for all movements. Gamma band activity did not change with movement direction and did not occur during passive movements. The stepwise increase of \u03b3 activity with movement size and velocity suggests a role of neuronal synchronization in this frequency range in basal ganglia control of the scaling of ongoing movements.", "pages": "179-83"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "Prominent 5-18 Hz oscillations in the pallidal-thalamic circuit in secondary dystonia.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "22262749", "authors": ["Tsang, EW", "Hamani, C", "Moro, E", "Mazzella, F", "Lozano, AM", "Yeh, IJ", "Chen, R"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Microelectrode recording (MER) is necessary for precision localization of target structures such as the subthalamic nucleus during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.

LFP signals are believed, in part, to reflect neural action potential activity, and LFP frequency modulations are linked to spiking events. Furthermore, LFP signals are increasingly accessible in human brain regions previously unreachable due to a proliferation of deep brain stimulation implantation procedures. Traditional LFP analysis involves computing power spectra densities (PSDs) of these signals, which captures power at various frequencies in the signal. However, PSDs are second order statistics and may not capture non-trivial temporal dependencies that exist in the raw data. In this paper, we propose an LFP analysis method that is useful for describing unique features of temporal dependencies in LFP signals. This method is based on autoregressive (AR) modeling and draws from the systems identification sub-field of systems and control. Specifically, we have built and analysed AR models of LFP activity, and have demonstrated statistically significant differences in temporal dependencies between diseased globus pallidus tissue and control regions in two dystonia patients receiving deep brain stimulation implantation.

We administered periodic pulse train DBS waveforms to the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) with frequencies ranging from 0-140 Hz, and computed statistics that quantified pathological bursting, oscillations, and synchronization in the BG as well as thalamic relay of cortical inputs. We found that none of the frequencies suppressed all pathological activity in BG, though the HF waveforms recovered thalamic reliability. Our rigorous study, however, led us to a novel DBS strategy involving low frequency multi-input phase-shifted DBS, which successfully suppressed pathological symptoms in all BG nuclei and enabled reliable thalamic relay.

Evaluation of the clinical evidence in TRD is complicated by the absence of a validated definition, and there is a need to move away from traditional definitions of remission based on severity of symptoms to one that includes normalisation of functioning. One potential way of improving treatment of TRD is through the use of predictive biomarkers and clinical variables. The advent of new treatments may also help by focusing on neurotransmitters other than serotonin. Strategies such as the switching of antidepressants, use of combination therapy with lithium, atypical antipsychotics and other pharmacological agents can improve outcomes, and techniques such as deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation have shown promising early results.

Knowledge about the connectivity of the human basal ganglia and thalamus has rapidly evolved over recent years through non-invasive imaging techniques, but has remained incomplete because of insufficient resolution and sensitivity of these techniques. Here, we present an imaging and computational protocol designed to generate a comprehensive in vivo and subject-specific, three-dimensional model of the structure and connections of the human basal ganglia. High-resolution structural and functional magnetic resonance images were acquired with a 7-Tesla magnet. Capitalizing on the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enriched contrast obtained at high-field MRI, detailed structural and connectivity representations of the human basal ganglia and thalamus were achieved. This unique combination of multiple imaging modalities enabled the in-vivo visualization of the individual human basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei, the reconstruction of seven white-matter pathways and their connectivity probability that, to date, have only been reported in animal studies, histologically, or group-averaged MRI population studies. Also described are subject-specific parcellations of the basal ganglia and thalamus into sub-territories based on their distinct connectivity patterns. These anatomical connectivity findings are supported by functional connectivity data derived from resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI).

OBJECTIVE: To verify the position of the DBS lead within the pons during PPTg targeting. METHODS: In 10 PD patients undergoing electrode implantation in the PPTg, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded after median nerve stimulation from the 4 DBS electrode contacts and from 2 scalp leads, placed in the frontal and parietal regions. RESULTS: The DBS electrode recorded a P16 potential (latency at contact 0: 16.33 \u00b1 0.76 ms). There was a P16 latency shift of 0.18 \u00b1 0.07 ms from contact 0 (lower) to contact 3 (upper). The scalp electrodes recorded the P14 far-field response (latency: 15.44 \u00b1 0.63 ms) and the cortical N20 potential (latency: 21.58 \u00b1 1.42 ms). The P16 potentials recorded by the intracranial electrode contacts are generated by the volley traveling along the medial lemniscus, while the scalp P14 potential represents a far-field response generated at the Obex level. Considering that the distance between the electrode contacts 0 and 3 is 6 mm, the distance of the electrode contact 0 from the Obex (\u0394Obex) was calculated by the equation: \u0394Obex=6x\u0394latency P14-PPTg0/\u0394latency PPTg0-PPTg3. The Obex-to-brainstem electrode distance obtained by the neurophysiological method confirmed that the electrode was located within the pons in all patients. Moreover, this distance was very similar to that issued from the individual brain MRI.

In Parkinson's disease, pedunculopontine nucleus stimulation is an emerging treatment for gait freezing. Local field potentials recorded from pedunculopontine nucleus electrodes in such patients have demonstrated oscillations in the alpha and beta frequency bands, reactive to self-paced movement. Whether these oscillations are topographically organized or relevant to locomotion is unknown. Here, we recorded local field potentials from the pedunculopontine nucleus in parkinsonian patients during rest and unconstrained walking. Relative gait speed was assessed with trunk accelerometry. Peaks of alpha power were present at rest and during gait, when they correlated with gait speed. Gait freezing was associated with attenuation of alpha activity. Beta peaks were less consistently observed across rest and gait, and did not correlate with gait speed. Alpha power was maximal in the caudal pedunculopontine nucleus region and beta power was maximal rostrally. These results indicate a topographic distribution of neuronal activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus region and concur with animal data suggesting that the caudal subregion has particular relevance to gait. Alpha synchronization, proposed to suppress 'task irrelevant' distraction, has previously been demonstrated to correlate with performance of cognitive tasks.

Many of these side effects, such as depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances, could be related to abnormal functioning of the serotonergic system, but much basic research remains to be done. Molecular studies in humans and animal models of the disease have reported diverse drastic changes to the serotonergic system. It has also been shown that the serotonergic system both plays a major role in the mechanism of action of the current therapies and is altered by the therapies. It has been reported that HFS-STN decreases serotonin release in several regions, mostly via inhibition of serotonergic neuron activity. The involvement of serotonergic neurons in L: -DOPA treatment is even more significant. First, serotonergic neurons, able to convert exogenous L: -DOPA to dopamine, are a major site to release dopamine throughout the brain. Second, the substitution of serotonin by newly synthesized dopamine in serotonin neurons leads to acute and chronic alteration of serotonin release and metabolism. Therefore, both therapeutic approaches, via distinct mechanisms, decrease serotonergic system activity and, rather than alleviating cognitive or mood disorders, tend to aggravate them.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed cortical sensitivity to facial semblance, the modulatory effects of context and temporal response dynamics. Results on all three fronts revealed systematic hemispheric differences. We found that: (i) activation patterns in the left fusiform gyrus correlate with image-level face-semblance, while those in the right correlate with categorical face/non-face judgements.

These observations have led to the use of GPi stimulation in patients with severe torticollis and Meige syndrome refractory to pharmacological agents as well to botulinum toxin injections. An increasing number of reports indicate the effectiveness of GPi stimulation in the treatment of intractable focal and segmental dystonia.

This may entail abnormal release of glutamate, the major source of which in STN is cortical afferents. Indeed, the cortico-subthalamic pathway is implicated in the emergence of excessive oscillations, which are reduced, as are symptoms, by dopamine-replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted to STN. Here we hypothesize that glutamatergic synapses in the STN may be differentially modulated by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS), the latter mimicking deep brain stimulation. Recordings of evoked and spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (EPSCs) were made from STN neurons in brain slices obtained from dopamine-intact and chronically dopamine-depleted adult rats. HFS had no significant effect on evoked (e) EPSC amplitude in dopamine-intact slices (104.4\u00b18.0%) but depressed eEPSCs in dopamine-depleted slices (67.8\u00b16.2%). Conversely, LFS potentiated eEPSCs in dopamine-intact slices (126.4\u00b18.1%) but not in dopamine-depleted slices (106.7\u00b110.0%). Analyses of paired-pulse ratio, coefficient of variation, and spontaneous EPSCs suggest that the depression and potentiation have a presynaptic locus of expression. These results indicate that the synaptic efficacy in dopamine-intact tissue is enhanced by LFS. Furthermore, the synaptic efficacy in dopamine-depleted tissue is depressed by HFS. Therefore the therapeutic effects of DBS in Parkinson's disease appear mediated, in part, by glutamatergic cortico-subthalamic synaptic depression and implicate dopamine-dependent increases in the weight of glutamate synapses, which would facilitate the transfer of pathological oscillations from the cortex.", "pages": "179-83"}, {"volume": "18 Suppl 1", "title": "New targets for DBS.", "issue": "", "pmid": "19959016", "authors": ["Benabid, AL", "Torres, N"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "Response inhibition as measured during a stop-signal task refers to the ability to halt an action that has already been set in motion. Cortical and sub-cortical structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN), that are active during attempts to inhibit action are thought to contribute to a 'stop-process' that must gain dominance over a 'go-process' if inhibition is to be successful. We recorded local field potential activity from the STN of Parkinson's disease patients with implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes during a stop-signal task. In particular we measured activity in the STN that has traditionally been associated with motor action (gamma-band, 60-100 Hz) and inhibition (beta-band, 10-30 Hz). Our data support the idea that beta activity in the STN is related to the inhibition of motor action. Further, we report that gamma oscillatory activity responds robustly to stop-signals as well as go-signals. This unexpected finding might suggest that gamma activity supports a go-process that not only responds to go-signals, but is also sensitive to stimuli that signal stopping.", "pages": "179-83"}, {"volume": "18 Suppl 1", "title": "Tandem deep brain stimulation--challenging new structural targets for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "20082981", "authors": ["Uitti, RJ"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "abstract": "The cognitive and behavioral effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) administered to the deep cerebral nuclei for epilepsy treatment is unknown.

We analyzed data from 24 severe treatment-resistant patients who underwent capsulotomy for OCD and were carefully followed-up one year after the surgery and at long term (mean 10.8 years after surgery). The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist was administered to assess the lifetime presence of the most common symptom types. We applied an algorithm to calculate the patients' scores on 4 well-established symptom dimensions: Contamination/cleaning, forbidden thoughts, symmetry/order and hoarding. Multiple regression models were employed to examine whether scores on certain symptom dimensions were predictive of long-term outcome. The presence and number of lifetime symptoms in the symmetry/order domain were associated with greater severity of OCD, depression and anxiety, as well as greater impairment in various functional domains like work, social and family life at both one-year and long-term follow-ups. These results remained consistently significant after controlling for preoperative psychopathology, scores on other OCD symptom dimensions, sex, age, age of onset, duration of follow-up, type of surgical procedure, number of operations and lesion volume.
