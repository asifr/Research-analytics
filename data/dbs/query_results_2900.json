Examples are pathological gambling, compulsive shopping and hypersexuality. Over the last decade, ICDs have become increasingly recognised as being associated with Parkinson disease (PD), with the literature highlighting a link between dopamine replacement therapy and the development of ICDs. Patients who develop ICDs in the context of compulsive anti-Parkinsonian drug use are described as having dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which is associated with repetitive complex stereotyped behaviours called punding. Case-control and observational studies have further noted that patients with PD who develop ICDs are more likely to have younger-onset PD, a history of alcohol dependence, novelty-seeking personality traits and psychiatric comorbidities. The pathophysiology of underlying mechanisms is not fully understood, but recent evidence suggests that dopaminergic drugs, particularly dopamine agonists, coupled with changes in reward pathways involving the ventral striatal and related circuitry, may play a role. Neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography and functional MRI have provided valuable information in this area: patients with DDS have been found to show enhanced dopamine release in the ventral striatum, suggesting functional abnormalities in the mesolimbic networks. Management of ICDs in patients with PD can be challenging, as they may not be aware of a change in their behaviour or may conceal their symptoms to avoid embarrassment. Currently, there is no clear evidence of an optimal treatment. Management is based on a careful balance of dopaminergic drugs with control of the aberrant behaviour, supported by psychological interventions.

Whereas earlier SEP components, occurring up to 100 ms after stimulus delivery, have been labeled 'preconscious', later responses have been associated with stimulus awareness. To date, how far these processes are primarily cortical or comprise additional subcortical operations remains open. Therefore, we recorded thalamic and scalp SEPs evoked by perceived as well as unperceived median nerve stimulation in neurosurgical patients with electrodes implanted into the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus for deep brain stimulation. At stimulation intensities below perceptual threshold, only thalamic SEP components appeared consistently during the first 75 ms after stimulus delivery. Stimulation that was perceived by the patients elicited cortical as well as thalamic SEPs that lasted longer than 75 ms.

Quantifying the activity of these patterns in individual subjects has provided an objective tool for the assessment of treatment efficacy and differential diagnosis. We have found that activity of the PD motor-related network is modulated by antiparkinsonian treatments such as dopaminergic therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) gene therapy. By contrast, the cognitive-related network is not altered by these interventions for PD motor symptoms. This pattern may however change in response to therapies targeting the cognitive symptoms of this disorder.

Interest in evaluating these sites for treatment of epilepsy has been enhanced by the success of vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy and DBS for movement disorders. Literature consists of mostly small and uncontrolled studies that are subject to limitations in interpretation.

Mechanisms of DBS are poorly understood, although investigations are actively being pursued. Little is known about optimal stimulation parameters.

In cats and rats, electrical stimulation delivered to the VMH has been shown to evoke an emotional \"panic attack-like\" escape behavior, and in humans, stimulation targeting nuclei just posterior or anterior to the VMH has reportedly induced panic attacks. The authors report findings obtained in an awake patient undergoing bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes into the hypothalamus that strongly implicates the VMH as being critically involved in the genesis of panic attacks. First, as the stimulating electrode progressed deeper into the VMH, the intensity of stimulation required to evoke an attack systematically decreased; second, while stimulation of the VMH in either hemisphere evoked panic, stimulation that appeared to be in the center of the VMH was more potent.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) receives prominent excitatory input directly from cortical areas implicated in dystonia pathogenesis and inhibitory input from the external globus pallidus. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the STN in dystonia by analyzing STN neuronal discharge in patients with idiopathic dystonia. Data were collected in awake patients undergoing microelectrode recording for implantation of STN deep brain stimulation electrodes. We recorded 62 STN neurons in 9 patients with primary dystonia. As a comparison group, we recorded 143 STN neurons in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Single-unit activity was discriminated off-line by principal component analysis and evaluated with respect to discharge rate, bursting, and oscillatory activity. The mean STN discharge rate in dystonia patients was 26.3 Hz (SD 13.6), which was lower than that in the PD patients (35.6 Hz, SD 15.2), but higher than published values for subjects without basal ganglia dysfunction. Oscillatory activity was found in both disorders, with a higher proportion of units oscillating in the beta range in PD. Bursting discharge was a prominent feature of both dystonia and PD, whereas sensory receptive fields were expanded in PD compared with dystonia. The STN firing characteristics, in conjunction with those previously published for GPi, suggest that bursting and oscillatory discharge in basal ganglia output may be transmitted via pathways involving the STN and provide a pathophysiologic rationale for STN as a surgical target in dystonia.", "pages": "678-83"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Research advances in geriatric depression.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "19834387", "authors": ["Alexopoulos, GS", "Kelly, RE"], "year": "2009", "journal": "World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)", "abstract": "Postural instability and falls are a major source of disability in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

The scan parameters of 3-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state are chosen in a way that T1WI can be obtained from conventional magnitude reconstruction and images with improved contrast between midbrain nuclei and surrounding tissues can be produced from the same data by performing susceptibility-weighted imaging reconstruction on a chosen region of interest.

At suprathreshold intensities, the patient's eyes remained open and conjugated throughout the stimulation period. The arousal effect ceased abruptly when DBS was discontinued. Behavioural arousal was accompanied by global cortical EEG activation in the gamma-frequency range (40-120 Hz) and by autonomic activation as evidenced by increased heart rate. The observed effect was reproducible in both hemispheres and topographically restricted to 6 out of 15 tested sites in the fibre-field between the GPi and the posterior aspect of the basal nucleus of Meynert. We conclude that the stimulated neural substrate in the subpallidal basal forebrain is involved in the premotor control of lid and eye position and the control of the activation state of the human neocortex. It may thus be important for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness in humans. It is suggested that subpallidal DBS released a downstream arousal circuit from anaesthesia-related inhibitory modulation either by direct excitation of an arousal nucleus or by inhibition of a sleep-promoting centre in the basal forebrain.", "pages": "678-83"}, {"volume": "623", "title": "Controversial action of positive modulator of subtype 7 of metabotropic glutamate receptors AMN082 on cortical epileptic afterdischarges in immature rats.", "issue": "1-3", "pmid": "10649575", "authors": ["Szczurowska, E", "Mares, P"], "year": "2009", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "abstract": "The effect of continuous electrical stimulation of the hippocampus bilaterally on seizures and memory was assessed in two subjects with seizures from both mesial temporal lobes who were not candidates for resective epilepsy surgery.

The cohort included n = 215 DBS patients. 25.6% of all 215 patients presented to the ED at least once, with the most common presentation occurring as a result of a decline in mental status when taking into account all visits (6%).

The objective of this works is to assess the role of posterior hypothalamus neuromodulation in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis patients. Five multiple sclerosis patients suffering from refractory recurrent trigeminal neuralgia involving all three trigeminal branches underwent deep brain stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus. The rationale of this intervention emerges from our earlier success in treating pain patients suffering from trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. After follow-up periods that ranged from 1 to 4 years after treatment, the paroxysmal pain arising from the first trigeminal branch was controlled, whereas the recurrence of pain in the second and third trigeminal branches necessitated repeated thermorhizotomies to control in pain in two patients after 2 years of follow-up.

Gait and speech were analysed on 11 Parkinsonian patients (PP) undergoing deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) and 11 control subjects under three conditions of velocity (natural, slow and speed). The patients were tested with and without l-dopa and stimulator ON or OFF. Locomotor parameters were recorded using an optoelectronic system. Speech parameters were recorded with a headphone while subjects were reading a short paragraph. The results confirmed that PP walk and read more slowly than controls. Patient's difficulties in modulating walking and speech velocities seem to be due mainly to an inability to internally control the step length and the interpause-speech duration (ISD). STN-DBS and levodopa increased patients' walking velocity by increasing the step length. STN-DBS and levodopa had no effect on speech velocity but restored the patients' ability to modulate the ISD. The walking cadence and speech index of rythmicity tended to be lower in patients and were not significantly improved by STN-DBS or levodopa. Speech and walking velocity as well as ISD and step length were correlated in both groups. Negative correlations between speech index of and walking cadence were observed in both groups.

Methods.\u2002The aim of this article is to review the published literature on electrical stimulation of the brain for epilepsy in animals and humans. Results.\u2002Animal and human research efforts have focused primarily on the study of the cerebellum, anterior thalamus, centromedian thalamus, substania nigra, caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Electrical stimulation of deep brain nuclei has in some instances controlled seizures and epilepsy. The advent of seizure detection devices used in closed-loop studies has in part redefined the strategy to prevent seizure occurrence and limit spread. Discussion.\u2002A number of studies in animals and humans indicate that electrical stimulation may be an alternative treatment for some patients with medically intractable epilepsy who are not candidates for conventional surgical options. Conclusion.\u2002The reduction in the number and/or severity of seizures found in some studies supports further investigation into the effects of electrical stimulation on the brain and the continuation of testing in animals and humans.", "pages": "678-83"}, {"volume": "256 Suppl 3", "title": "Management of non-motor complications in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17045296", "authors": ["Fujimoto, K"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "We propose an approach for desynchronization in an ensemble of globally coupled neural oscillators.
