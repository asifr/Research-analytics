Is there anything new?\" As the initial speaker at the symposium organized by the Parkinson's Disease Foundation in celebration of its 50th anniversary, I sought to address these questions, focusing on research published between the years 1997 and 2007. I cataloged the advances I considered most important in the field, recognizing my viewpoint is a subjective one and most likely differs from similar listings that others would put together. Space limitation allows me to discuss only a tiny fraction of the remarkable new findings that have been discovered during this 10-year span. Nevertheless, I expect the readers of this summation of advances in the field to be as impressed as I am on the wealth, breadth, and excitement stirring in the field of PD research. Included in this overview are highlights in both laboratory science and clinical science of PD research. In the former category are advances in knowledge on the genetics of PD; potential etiologic and pathogenic causes, especially the better understanding of endogenous factors within dopaminergic neurons; pathologic changes including deposition of alpha-synuclein aggregates; and the consequences of altered alpha-synuclein on the degradation of proteins by both the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and the lysosome. Clinical science has also been very active and impressively productive with important clinical advances. In this category are new information on the epidemiology of PD, including awareness of additional factors (besides smoking) that might slow the onset and worsening of PD, such as caffeine and urate; neuroimaging with positron emission tomography and single photon emission tomography; keener awareness of nonmotor features of PD and their impact on quality of life for the persons with PD and their family; recognition of behavioral complications of medications utilized to treat PD, such as impulse control problems; appreciation of the natural history of PD with the increasing impairments as the disease relentlessly worsens over time; the many controlled clinical trials attempting to slow the progression of the disease and to provide new symptomatic therapies; and surgical approaches to alleviate symptoms and progression, including cellular and gene therapy as well as deep brain stimulation.", "pages": "S71-5"}, {"volume": "25 Suppl 1", "title": "The nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease--an overview.", "issue": "", "pmid": "20187234", "authors": ["Lim, SY", "Lang, AE"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are very common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may result in significant disability.

However, only a few methods have a selective effect on the SGNs, which is of importance since it might be clinically more relevant to study hearing impairment with the hair cells undamaged. beta-Bungarotoxin is a venom of the Taiwan banded krait, which in vitro has been shown to induce apoptosis in neurons, leaving remaining cochlear cells intact. We wanted to create an in vivo rat model of selective damage to primary auditory neurons. Under deep anaesthesia, 41 rats received beta-Bungarotoxin or saline to the round window niche. At postoperative intervals between days 3 and 21 auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement, immunohistochemistry, SGN quantification and cochlear surface preparation were performed. The results in the beta-Bungarotoxin-treated ears, as compared with sham-operated ears, show significantly increased ABR thresholds at all postoperative intervals, illustrating a severe to profound hearing loss at all tested frequencies (3.5, 7, 16 and 28 kHz). Quantification of the SGNs showed no obvious reduction in neuronal numbers until 14 days postoperatively. Between days 14 and 21 a significant reduction in SGN numbers was observed.

Although a reduced serotonergic function has been linked to the psychiatric effects of antiparkinsonian treatments, biochemical evidence supporting this hypothesis is still lacking. By using a microdialysis approach in anesthetized rats, we investigated the ability of STN-HFS (130 Hz, 30 muA, 20 min) and l-DOPA (6-12 mg/kg) to change extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) monitored simultaneously in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPP), two brain regions involved in the regulation of mood and cognition that receive a distinct 5-HT innervation. The results show that STN-HFS inhibited 5-HT levels in the PFC and HIPP of sham-lesioned and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. The effect elicited by STN-HFS was blocked by the administration of the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin. l-DOPA (6 and 12 mg/kg) reduced 5-HT levels in the PFC and HIPP of 6-OHDA rats. STN-HFS did not further decrease 5-HT levels induced by l-DOPA, but attenuated l-DOPA-induced dopamine release in the PFC and HIPP. These neurochemical data show that STN-HFS inhibits 5-HT release by modulating serotonergic neuron activity, while the decrease in 5-HT levels induced by l-DOPA may include its direct action inside serotonergic neurons.

The Braak hypothesis proposes that the earliest pathological evidence of PD is found in the enteric nervous system, medulla and olfactory bulb, and only subsequently progresses (over years) to the substantia nigra and cortex. Non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, hyposmia and sleep disorders, may precede typical motor features of PD by several years. No treatment has been convincingly shown to slow PD progression (ie, a neuroprotective drug remains elusive). Symptomatic benefit from dopaminergic therapy is usually maintained throughout the course of the disease. The decision as to whether to commence treatment with either levodopa or a dopamine agonist needs to be individually tailored, but long-term outcomes appear to be equivalent. Advanced PD is complicated by the loss of non-dopaminergic neurones, resulting in symptoms that are largely unresponsive to dopaminergic therapy.

However, the STN neurons do show a change in background firing rate in response to stimulation, even when they are classified as sub-threshold by the VTA definition. Furthermore the whole neuron models are sensitive to regions of high current density, as the distribution of firing is centred on the electrode contact edges These results demonstrate the importance of accurate neuron models for fully appreciating the spatial effects of DBS on the immediate surrounding brain volume within small distances of the electrode, which are overlooked by previous models of isolated axons and individual neurons.", "pages": "S71-5"}, {"volume": "122", "title": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: correlation of active contacts and electrophysiologically mapped subthalamic nucleus.", "issue": "20", "pmid": "20142356", "authors": ["Zheng, Z", "Zhang, YQ", "Li, JY", "Zhang, XH", "Zhuang, P", "Li, YJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "abstract": "The analysis of long-latency event-related potentials (ERPs) is an important approach in the evaluation of certain cognitive functions, particularly selective attention, and in following their subsequent changes.

Cellular evidence has been provided in experimental animals that thalamic degeneration may not aggravate but rather counteract the effects of dopamine lesion.

This view fits with converging anecdotic and recent direct experience in patients that stress the potential of CM/PF deep brain stimulation (DBS) to alleviate motor disorders, notably tremor and dyskinesias. As a preclinical contribution to the characterization of this target, we investigated the functional impact of CM/Pf-DBS in the 6-hydroxydopamine hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD.

Unlike subthalamic nucleus, CM/Pf-HFS did not induce per se dyskinesias.

Options to prolong the effects of tDCS are further prolongation or repetition of tDCS.

Thus we explored the effects of different break durations on cathodal tDCS-induced cortical excitability alterations.

Optogenetic-based neurostimulation approaches are capable of activating individual synapses and yield the highest spatial control over brain circuit activity. Both electrical and light-based neurostimulation methods require intrusive procedures such as surgical implantation of electrodes or photon-emitting devices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has also shown therapeutic effectiveness and represents a recent paradigm shift towards implementing less invasive brain stimulation methods. Magnetic-based stimulation, however, has a limited focusing capacity and lacks brain penetration power. Because ultrasound can be noninvasively transmitted through the skull to targeted deep brain circuits, it may offer alternative approaches to currently employed neuromodulation techniques. Encouraging this idea, literature spanning more than half a century indicates that ultrasound can modulate neuronal activity. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of potential mechanisms underlying the actions of ultrasound on neuronal excitability, here, I propose the continuum mechanics hypothesis of ultrasonic neuromodulation in which ultrasound produces effects on viscoelastic neurons and their surrounding fluid environments to alter membrane conductance. While further studies are required to test this hypothesis, experimental data indicate ultrasound represents a promising platform for developing future therapeutic neuromodulation approaches.", "pages": "S71-5"}, {"volume": "88", "title": "Comparison of hippocampal Deep Brain Stimulation with high (130Hz) and low frequency (5Hz) on afterdischarges in kindled rats.", "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "11087781", "authors": ["Isra\u00ebl, M", "Steiger, H", "Kolivakis, T", "McGregor, L", "Sadikot, AF"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "In the last decades, the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has improved significantly with the introduction into the clinical practice of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): this has led to a renewed interest in this condition and development of appropriate therapeutic strategies, including non-pharmacological techniques.", "pages": "S71-5"}, {"volume": "67", "title": "Deep brain stimulation in the subgenual cingulate cortex for an intractable eating disorder.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "11094119", "authors": ["Baune, BT", "Dannlowski, U", "Domschke, K", "Janssen, DG", "Jordan, MA", "Ohrmann, P", "Bauer, J", "Biros, E", "Arolt, V", "Kugel, H", "Baxter, AG", "Suslow, T"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive and critical review of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments usually adopted in the management of OCD.
