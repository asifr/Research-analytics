Seventeen patients with a mean age of 59.3 \u00b1 7.1 years (range, 45-70), mean disease duration of 12.5 \u00b1 4.3 years (range, 7-20), and contraindications for STN DBS, underwent bilateral GPi DBS. They were evaluated before surgery and 6 months afterward, in accordance with Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantation recommendations. There were mean improvements of 41.1% in the UPDRS III motor score in the off-dopa condition and 20.3% in the activities of daily living score. Motor fluctuations were reduced by 22.9% and dyskinesias by 68.6%. Axial motor signs improved in the off-dopa condition by 34.2%. Neuropsychological performances remained unchanged at the 6-month assessment. Bilateral GPi DBS is both safe and effective in advanced parkinsonian patients with untreatable motor fluctuations, for whom STN DBS is contraindicated due to dopa-resistant axial motor signs or cognitive decline. As such, it should be regarded as a viable option for these patients.", "pages": "1839-46"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Long-term effect of unilateral pallidotomy on levodopa-induced dyskinesia.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "20568091", "authors": ["Kleiner-Fisman, G", "Lozano, A", "Moro, E", "Poon, YY", "Lang, AE"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Unilateral pallidotomy has been effectively used to treat parkinsonism and reduce levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID).

One of the causes involved in the genesis of the motor fluctuations that are observed in PD is the variable absorption of the medication due to an irregular or erratic emptying of the gastric content. Today, a method of therapy is now available that allows levodopa to be administered directly into the duodenum at a continuous rate by a perfusor. The medication is applied through a duodenal catheter implanted by means of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. This new form of administration has been marketed under the name of Duodopa, which is a pharmaceutical form of levodopa in a micronised suspension in a thickening gel consisting of sodium carmelose. It is presented in combination with levodopa (20 mg/mL) and a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa (5 mg/mL). Duodopa has proved to be effective in reducing the percentage of off time and in diminishing the periods with disabling dyskinesias. This therapy has also proved to be useful for relieving certain non-motor aspects associated with PD and presents fewer limitations regarding indication for advanced PD patients than those that usually exist for the case of deep brain stimulation. Although the therapy has proved to be effective, it is not free of complications arising from malfunctioning of the infusion system or in relation to the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.", "pages": "1839-46"}, {"volume": "152", "title": "Surgical strategy for insular cavernomas.", "issue": "10", "pmid": "20563609", "authors": ["Leal, PR", "Houtteville, JP", "Etard, O", "Emery, E"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "Surgical treatment of cavernomas arising in the insula (especially in dominant cerebral hemisphere) is challenging in reason of the proximity to the internal capsule and lenticulostriate arteries.

Usually studied with pharmacological or hormonal tools, CNS arousal can also be elevated by deep brain stimulation (DBS), in the human brain and in animals.

We demonstrate a novel approach for testing the effectiveness of DBS to increase arousal in intact female mice: all of the foregoing parameters are held constant. Only the temporal patterning of the pulses within the stimulation is varied. To create differentially patterned pulse trains, a deterministic nonlinear dynamic equation was used to generate a series of pulses with a predetermined average frequency. Three temporal patterns of stimulation were defined: two nonlinear patterns, Nonlinear1 (NL1) and Nonlinear2 (NL2), and the conventional pattern, Fixed Frequency (FF). Female mice with bilateral monopolar electrodes were observed before, during and after hippocampal or medial thalamic stimulation. NL1 hippocampal stimulation was significantly more effective at increasing behavioral arousal than either FF or NL2; however, FF and NL2 stimulation of the medial thalamus were more effective than NL1. During the same experiments, we recorded an unpredicted increase in the spectral power of slow waves in the cortical EEG.

Yet there are over 1 million tinnitus sufferers who still endure troublesome chronic, continuous head noises that are debilitating and interfere with activities of daily living. Here we show that application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy to a locus of caudate neurons (area LC) in the body of the nucleus, a subsite of the striatum that is not part of the classical auditory pathway, can decrease or increase tinnitus loudness perception. The DBS lead traversed through or was adjacent to area LC in six Parkinson's disease and essential tremor subjects with concomitant tinnitus who underwent implantation of the subthalamic or ventral intermediate nucleus. In five subjects where the DBS lead tip traversed area LC, tinnitus loudness in both ears was suppressed to a nadir of level 2 or lower on a 0-10 rating scale. In one subject where the DBS lead was outside area LC, tinnitus was not modulated. In three subjects with preoperative and postoperative audiograms, hearing thresholds were unchanged by area LC stimulation. Neuromodulation of area LC may be interrupting perceptual integration of phantom sensations generated in the central auditory system.

Recently, functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that amygdala hyperactivity is responsible for the symptoms of PTSD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can functionally reduce the activity of a cerebral target by delivering an electrical signal through an electrode. We tested whether DBS of the amygdala could be used to treat PTSD symptoms. Rats traumatized by inescapable shocks, in the presence of an unfamiliar object, develop the tendency to bury the object when re-exposed to it several days later. This behavior mimics the symptoms of PTSD. 10 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent the placement of an electrode in the right basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLn). The rats were then subjected to a session of inescapable shocks while being exposed to a conspicuous object (a ball). Five rats received DBS treatment while the other 5 rats did not. After 7 days of treatment, the rats were re-exposed to the ball and the time spent burying it under the bedding was recorded. Rats treated with BLn DBS spent on average 13 times less time burying the ball than the sham control rats. The treated rats also spent 18 times more time exploring the ball than the sham control rats. In conclusion, the behavior of treated rats in this PTSD model was nearly normalized.

Here, we analysed the spectral and spatial characteristics of 314 microelectrode trajectories from 128 patients undergoing subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease. We correlated the subthalamic nucleus pathophysiology with the outcome of surgery, as evaluated by the third section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (motor score), which was subdivided into tremor, rigidity, limb-bradykinesia and axial-bradykinesia subscores. beta-oscillatory activity (13-30 Hz) comprised a continuous stretch within the subthalamic nucleus, and was limited to a distinctly-bounded dorsolateral oscillatory region. Although less consistent and more sporadic, low-frequency (3-7 Hz) power was also increased in the dorsolateral oscillatory region. In contrast, the more ventral subthalamic nucleus was characterized by consistently reduced beta and increased gamma (30-100 Hz) activity. Neuronal responses to passive arm movement (analysed by their alignment to goniometer tracing of the joints' angular displacement) were significantly more common in the dorsolateral oscillatory region than the ventral subthalamic nucleus region (62 versus 25% of sites tested respectively, P<0.01). The length of the dorsolateral oscillatory region recorded in the macroelectrode-implanted trajectory predicted a favourable response to subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (R=0.67, P<0.0001). This correlation was also evident for improvement in the specific symptom subscores of rigidity, limb-bradykinesia and axial-bradykinesia (P<0.05). Similarly, increased subthalamic nucleus beta power was associated with postoperative improvement. In contrast, the preoperative response to levodopa did not correlate with dorsolateral oscillatory region length (P=0.33), however, it did tend to be associated with increased beta (and decreased low frequency) subthalamic nucleus power. Finally, the active macroelectrode contact, independently selected by optimal clinical outcome, coincided with the dorsolateral oscillatory region centre. On average, the location of the active contact was not significantly different from the dorsolateral oscillatory region centre (P=0.10), but was significantly different from the subthalamic nucleus centre (P<0.0001). We conclude that the spatial extent of the dorsolateral oscillatory region, which overlaps the motor territories of the subthalamic nucleus, predicts the outcome of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. Thus the frequency and spatial characteristics of the subthalamic nucleus trajectory may be used for deep brain stimulation outcome optimization.", "pages": "1839-46"}, {"volume": "66", "title": "Successful implantation of a deep brain stimulator for essential tremor in a patient with a preexisting cochlear implant: surgical technique: technical case report.", "issue": "6 Suppl Operative", "pmid": "12489094", "authors": ["De Los Reyes, K", "Chandrasekhar, SS", "Tagliati, M", "Alterman, R"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "abstract": "Perinatal anoxia rarely causes myoclonus as the main neurologic abnormality.

Thus, we examined the effect of a similar manipulation, pharmacological inactivation of the infralimbic cortex, the rodent correlate of BA25, in an animal model of antidepressant activity: the modified rat forced swim test. Transient inactivation of the infralimbic cortex using muscimol reduced immobility, an antidepressant-like effect in the test. Importantly, this activity was not the result of a general increase in locomotor activity. Activation of the infralimbic cortex using bicuculline did not alter behaviour. Finally, we examined the effect of muscimol in animals bred for high anxiety-related behaviour, which also display elevated depression-related behaviour. Transient inactivation of the infralimbic cortex decreased the high inborn depression-like behaviour of these rats.

We hypothesize that DBS relieves symptoms by minimizing pathologically disordered neuronal activity in the basal ganglia. In human participants with parkinsonism and clinically effective deep brain leads, regular (i.e., periodic) high-frequency stimulation was replaced with irregular (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation at the same mean frequency (130 Hz). Bradykinesia, a symptomatic slowness of movement, was quantified via an objective finger tapping protocol in the absence and presence of regular and irregular DBS. Regular DBS relieved bradykinesia more effectively than irregular DBS. A computational model of the relevant neural structures revealed that output from the globus pallidus internus was more disordered and thalamic neurons made more transmission errors in the parkinsonian condition compared with the healthy condition. Clinically therapeutic, regular DBS reduced firing pattern disorder in the computational basal ganglia and minimized model thalamic transmission errors, consistent with symptom alleviation by clinical DBS. However, nontherapeutic, irregular DBS neither reduced disorder in the computational basal ganglia nor lowered model thalamic transmission errors. Thus we show that clinically useful DBS alleviates motor symptoms by regularizing basal ganglia activity and thereby improving thalamic relay fidelity. This work demonstrates that high-frequency stimulation alone is insufficient to alleviate motor symptoms: DBS must be highly regular.

Effective treatment acting on the pathogenic cascade may increase the quality of life and outcome in patients with MID and may prevent a therapeutic nihilism occasionally upcoming with MIDs.", "pages": "1839-46"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "[Ethical aspects of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders].", "issue": "5", "pmid": "18541625", "authors": ["Schmetz, MK", "Heinemann, T"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an important component of the therapy of movement disorders and has almost completely replaced high-frequency coagulation of brain tissue in stereotactic neurosurgery. Despite the functional efficacy of DBS, which in parts is documented on the highest evidence level, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood. According to the current state of knowledge electrophysiological and functional data give evidence that high-frequency DBS has an inhibitory effect around the stimulation electrode whilst at the same time axons entering or leaving the stimulated brain area are excited leading to modulation of neuronal networks. The latter effect modifies pathological discharges of neurons in key structures of the basal ganglia network (e.g. irregular bursting activity, oscillations or synchronization) which are found in particular movement disorders such as Parkinson' s disease or dystonia. The introduction of technical standards, such as the integration of high resolution MRI into computer-assisted treatment planning, in combination with special treatment planning software have contributed significantly to the reduction of severe surgical complications (frequency of intracranial hemorrhaging 1-3%) in recent years. Future developments will address the modification of hardware components of the stimulation system, the evaluation of new brain target areas, the simultaneous stimulation of different brain areas and the assessment of different stimulation paradigms (high-frequency vs low-frequency DBS).", "pages": "1839-46"}, {"volume": "78", "title": "[Personality changes due to deep brain stimulation?].", "issue": "5", "pmid": "18955072", "authors": ["Klosterk\u00f6tter, J"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a safe and successful therapeutic option for patients with dystonia and tremor syndrome who do not respond sufficiently to conservative therapies. The most common target of DBS in patients with dystonia is the internal region of the globus pallidus (GPI). DBS of the GPI leads to long-lasting and remarkable improvement of dystonic movements in about 80% of patients. Recently it could be shown that not only patients with idiopathic dystonia but also patients with secondary dystonia can benefit from DBS although to a somewhat lesser extent. In patients with tremor syndromes, such as essential tremor, tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease or tremor in multiple sclerosis (MS) the intermediate ventral nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) as well as the subthalamic region proved to be promising targets for DBS electrodes. Especially in patients with essential tremor VIM-DBS leads to an often acute reduction of the tremor syndrome. In long-term observations, however, patients with essential tremor showed some tolerability to VIM-DBS leading to a slow increase of stimulation parameters to maintain a stable effect. VIM-DBS in patients with Parkinson's disease is rare and is reserved for elderly patients with pronounced tremor syndrome and little disease progression. Controlled studies and data on DBS in MS tremor are lacking and data are sparse and heterogeneous. Therefore, VIM-DBS in MS tremor patients has to be evaluated individually with caution. In summary patients with tremor syndromes as well as dystonia who cannot be adequately controlled with conservative therapy are good candidates for deep brain stimulation, a therapeutic option with moderate complications and risks and very good outcome for most patients.", "pages": "1839-46"}, {"volume": "81", "title": "[Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "19054696", "authors": ["Herzog, J", "Deuschl, G"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Der Nervenarzt", "abstract": "Since approximately 10 years investigations have been carried out on the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorders and depression. New fields of application are for Tourette's syndrome, substance abuse, dementia and anxiety. New functional, structural and molecular data have led to a new conceptualization of these disorders as dysfunctions of networks which process motivational and affective stimuli. DBS permits the selective and basically reversible modulation of such networks. So far adverse effects have been graded as marginal. In the field of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorders and depressive disorders uncontrolled studies have been published with initial satisfactory and concordant indications of the therapeutic effect of DBS in a variety of target areas of the brain. It is most important to provide a consistent interdisciplinary and durable development of concepts for a responsible use of DBS in patients with psychiatric disorders.
