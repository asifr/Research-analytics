Its mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood. In the present study, gene expression analyses were performed in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, i.e. striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. Using microarrays, gene expression was analysed in 1-mm-thick sagittal brain slices, including basal ganglia of five groups of male Wistar rats. These were unmanipulated rats (group A), unlesioned rats with implanted electrode but without stimulation (group B), unlesioned, stimulated rats (group C), 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with implanted electrode but without stimulation (group D), and finally 6-OHDA-lesioned and stimulated rats (group E). A statistically significant downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression induced by 6-OHDA lesion and an HFS-induced TH upregulation in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats could be detected. It could be hypothesized that the HFS-induced upregulation of TH is the result of neuronal STN modulation and mediated via projections from STN to substantia nigra pars compacta. Furthermore, a downregulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IIA and Homer1 was observed. This downregulation could result in a reduced sensitivity towards glutamate in basal ganglia downstream of STN.", "pages": "239-50"}, {"volume": "106", "title": "Localization of electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus on magnetic resonance imaging.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17240554", "authors": ["Pollo, C", "Vingerhoets, F", "Pralong, E", "Ghika, J", "Maeder, P", "Meuli, R", "Thiran, JP", "Villemure, JG"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "The authors describe a new method of localizing electrodes on magnetic resonance (MR) images and focus on the positions of both the most efficient contact and the electrode related to the MR imaging target.", "pages": "239-50"}, {"volume": "6", "title": "Recent advances in the treatment of chronic pain with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17239806", "authors": ["Fregni, F", "Freedman, S", "Pascual-Leone, A"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Thirty-one patients who had undergone bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) were included in this study.

GABA is a neurotransmitter in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that mediates analgesia locally, and also through activation of supraspinal sites. TENS reduces hyperalgesia through activation of receptor-mediated pathways at the level of the spinal cord, and supraspinally. The current study tested the hypothesis that either high or low frequency TENS applied to the inflamed knee joint increases GABA in the spinal cord dorsal horn and activates GABA receptors spinally. We utilized microdialysis to sample the extracellular fluid before, during and after TENS and analyzed GABA in dialysates with high performance liquid chromatography. We analyzed the extracellular GABA concentrations in animals with and without knee joint inflammation induced by intra-articular injection of kaolin and carrageenan. We further tested if spinal blockade of GABA receptors prevents the antihyperalgesia produced by TENS in rats with joint inflammation. We show that high frequency TENS increases extracellular GABA concentrations in the spinal cord in animals with and without joint inflammation. The increases in GABA do not occur in response to low frequency TENS, and there are no increases in glycine in response to low or high frequency TENS. However, the reduction in primary hyperalgesia by both high and low frequency TENS is prevented by spinal blockade of GABA(A) receptors with bicuculline. Thus, high frequency TENS increases release of GABA in the deep dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and both high and low frequency TENS reduce primary hyperalgesia by activation of GABA(A) receptors spinally.", "pages": "239-50"}, {"volume": "85", "title": "Neuropsychological effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "2-3", "pmid": "17234163", "authors": ["Bordini, BJ", "Garg, A", "Gallagher, CL", "Bell, B", "Garell, PC"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "For individuals with advanced Parkinson disease (PD), stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) reduces tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, but the effects of stimulation on gait and mobility are not fully understood.

Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms.

It therefore represents an attractive method for obtaining detailed maps of cortical organization (Vanduffel et al, 2001; Zhao et al, 2005). However, it remains to be determined how the spatial profile of CBV maps of cortical activity derived with MION compares with the profile of BOLD activation maps under a variety of different stimulation conditions. We used several stimulation paradigms to compare the spatial specificity of CBV versus BOLD activation maps in macaque area V1 at 4.7 T. We observed that: (1) CBV modulation is relatively stronger in deep cortical layers compared with BOLD, in agreement with studies in cats (Harel et al, 2006) and rodents (Lu et al, 2004; Mandeville and Marota, 1999) and (2) surprisingly, under large surround stimulation conditions, CBV maps extend along the cortical surface to cover large (>10 mm) regions of the cortex that are devoid of significant BOLD modulation.

The most striking change is the promotion of reactivity in the gamma frequency band, but it remains unclear whether the latter is itself a pathological feature, possibly associated with levodopa induced dyskinesias, or is primarily physiological. Gamma band reactivity in the cerebral cortex of humans without Parkinson's disease occurs contralateral to movement, so we posited that lateralization of subcortical gamma reactivity should occur following levodopa if the latter restores a more physiological pattern in patients with Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, we studied movement-related changes in STN LFP activity in 11 Parkinson's disease patients (age 59 +/- 2.7 years, three females) while they performed ipsi- and contralateral self-paced joystick movements ON and OFF levodopa. A bilaterally symmetrical gamma band power increase occurred around movement onset in the OFF state. Following levodopa this feature became significantly more pronounced in the subthalamic region contralateral to movement. The physiological nature of this asymmetric pattern of gamma reactivity was confirmed in the STN of two tremor patients without Parkinson's disease. Although levodopa treatment in the Parkinson's disease patients did not lead to lateralization of power suppression at lower frequencies (8-30 Hz), it did increase the degree of power suppression.

Extracellular field potentials in layer II/III consisting of an early component (fAP) and a late component (fPSP) were activated by electrical stimulation of the deep layers. The fPSP and intracellularly recorded excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) could be facilitated by paired-pulse stimulation at a low frequency (0.033Hz, pulse interval 20-400ms). An initial facilitation and subsequent depression were obtained when high frequency (12.5, 25 and 50Hz) tetanus stimulations were applied to the ACC slice. A post-tetanic augmentation 30s in duration was also observed. The effects of tetanic stimulation were altered in the presence of an increased or a decreased calcium concentration. Application of omega-conotoxin GVIA (CTX) in normal calcium concentration conditions decreased overall responses during tetanic stimulation similar to reducing calcium exposure. However CTX application did not increase paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) as is seen under low calcium conditions. These results indicate that calcium is involved in the formation of certain features of STP in layer II/III of the ACC and that N-type calcium channels contribute to some, but not all, components of these plastic changes.

These fibres fail to transmit consecutive antidromic spikes at the beginning of high-frequency stimulation, but are able to maintain a steady low-frequency (6-12 Hz) spike output during the stimulation. In addition, antidromic responses evoked from both branches are rarely present in cortical neurones with a more hyperpolarized membrane potential. Our data indicate that axon-mediated antidromic excitation in the cortex is strongly influenced by the myelo-architecture of the stimulation site and the excitability of individual cortical neurones.", "pages": "239-50"}, {"volume": "129", "title": "Deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease can mimic the 300 Hz subthalamic rhythm.", "issue": "Pt 12", "pmid": "17213863", "authors": ["Foffani, G", "Priori, A"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has the potential to significantly reduce motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).

Twenty-nine subsequently underwent surgery to the contralateral side and completed a second follow-up neuropsychological evaluation 15 months later.

We used [15O]-H2O positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 12 healthy women during a nonsexual resting state, clitorally induced orgasm, sexual clitoral stimulation (sexual arousal control) and imitation of orgasm (motor output control). Extracerebral markers of sexual performance and orgasm were rectal pressure variability (RPstd) and perceived level of sexual arousal (PSA). Sexual stimulation of the clitoris (compared to rest) significantly increased rCBF in the left secondary and right dorsal primary somatosensory cortex, providing the first account of neocortical processing of sexual clitoral information. In contrast, orgasm was mainly associated with profound rCBF decreases in the neocortex when compared with the control conditions (clitoral stimulation and imitation of orgasm), particularly in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus and anterior temporal pole. Significant positive correlations were found between RPstd and rCBF in the left deep cerebellar nuclei, and between PSA and rCBF in the ventral midbrain and right caudate nucleus. We propose that decreased blood flow in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex signifies behavioural disinhibition during orgasm in women, and that deactivation of the temporal lobe is directly related to high sexual arousal. In addition, the deep cerebellar nuclei may be involved in orgasm-specific muscle contractions while the involvement of the ventral midbrain and right caudate nucleus suggests a role for dopamine in female sexual arousal and orgasm.", "pages": "239-50"}, {"volume": "253 Suppl 7", "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "17210902", "authors": ["Okuma, Y"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the possible existence of gender-related neurophysiological differences in the oscillatory activity of the human subthalamic area.

In particular, it is unclear whether the pattern of innervation is the same for upper and lower facial muscles, and what is the motor cortical area giving rise to such innervation. We used electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease to activate motor tracts at a subcortical level. We examined the excitatory and inhibitory effects of unilateral single STN deep brain stimulation (sSTN-DBS) in 14 patients by taking recordings from facial, cervical and upper limb muscles on both sides. We measured the latency and amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and the latency and duration of the silent periods, and compared ipsilateral with contralateral responses and responses obtained in different muscles. Unilateral sSTN-DBS induced strictly contralateral MEPs in the trapezius, deltoid, biceps and thenar muscles. The same stimulus always induced bilateral MEPs in the orbicularis oculi, orbicularis oris, masseter and sternocleidomastoid at a mean latency in the range 6.0-9.1 ms. MEP latencies in the orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris were significantly longer than in the masseter and sternocleidomastoid (P < 0.01). A short latency small action potential was recorded in the ipsilateral orbicularis oculi that was likely generated by activation of extraocular muscles. During sustained voluntary muscle contraction, a silent period was recorded at similar onset latency on both sides. This period was significantly shorter in orbicularis oculi than in masseter, and in the ipsilateral side for both muscles (P < 0.01). sSTN-DBS is able to activate the descending projecting fibres in the corticobulbar tract eliciting bilateral MEPs and silent periods in facial and cranial muscles. This suggests that fibres to both ipsi- and contralateral motor nuclei descend together at the level of the STN.

The aim of this experimental study was to: (1) Establish an experimental pain model using electrical stimuli to describe characteristics of nociception from the human temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and overlying skin. (2) Test the hypothesis that there would be sex-related differences in TMJ sensitivity. Forty-three healthy subjects (24 men and 19 women) participated. Using two unipolar needle electrodes into the skin (above the TMJ) in one session or into the TMJ in the other session, sensory detection threshold (SDT), pain detection threshold (PDT), and summation threshold (SumT) were measured, before and after repetitive electrical stimulation. Painful repetitive electrical stimulation was applied for 20 min with individually adjustment of the intensity of the stimuli to keep the pain rating around five on a 0-10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Sensitivity to tactile and pin-prick stimuli were assessed at 11 sites around the TMJ using two von Frey nylon filaments (5.16 and 84.96 g), as well as pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PPTOL) before the stimulation, after 20 min of stimulation and finally 15 min after the end of stimulation. Numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 100 was used to rate the intensity of applied von Frey filaments. SDT, PDT, and SumT were higher in the TMJ than in the skin. These three measures increased after painful repetitive stimulation for 20 min (de-sensitization). In contrast to this effect, a hypersensitivity to pin-prick stimuli was detected around the TMJ area on the stimulated side after 20 min of electrical stimulation in the TMJ, but not in the skin. A bilateral hyposensitivity to tactile stimuli was detected after skin and TMJ stimulation. PPT and PPTOL did not show a significant change over time. Except for lower TMJ PPTOLs in women than men there were no significant sex-related differences in mechanical or electrical measures. The present findings indicate differences in the elicitation of hypersensitivity following repetitive electrical stimulation of skin and deep tissues. The mechanisms underlying these findings are not clear but differences in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression is a possibility. From a clinical point of view, the lack of sex differences in most of the used measures indicates that the higher prevalence of women than men amongst patients with persistent TMJ pain problems not entirely can be ascribed to a higher sensitivity of the TMJ.

Superficial layers of the EC convey the cortical input projections to the hippocampus, whereas deep layers of the EC relay hippocampal output projections back to the superficial layers of the EC or to other cortical regions. Whereas the EC expresses long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been determined. Because the axons of the stellate neurons in layer II of the EC form the perforant path that innervates the dentate gyrus granule cells of the hippocampus, we studied the mechanisms underlying the long-term plasticity in identified stellate neurons. Application of high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz for 1 s, repeated 3 times at an interval of 10 s) or forskolin (50 microM) failed to induce significant changes in synaptic strength, whereas application of pairing (presynaptic stimulation at 0.33 Hz paired with postsynaptic depolarization from -60 to -10 mV for 5 min) or low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 1 Hz for 15 min) paradigm-induced LTD. Pairing- or LFS-induced LTDs were N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent and occluded each other suggesting that they have the similar cellular mechanism. Pairing-induced LTD required the activity of calcineurin and involved AMPA receptor endocytosis that required the function of ubiquitin-proteasome system.

It is very uncommon in untreated patients and is more frequently seen as a complication of its treatment. In this review, the various types of dystonia occurring in PD, the differential diagnosis with other parkinsonian syndromes associated with dystonia and treatments available are revised. Dystonia unrelated to treatment can be typical (blepharospasm, torticollis), atypical (parkinsonian writer's cramp, camptocormia, anismus), or occurring in earlyonset Parkinson disease (the so-called kinesigenic foot dystonia, considered a hallmark of early-onset Parkinson's disease). Early and prominent dystonia in untreated patients with parkinsonism should raise the suspicion of other entities other than Parkinson's disease, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy or corticobasal degeneration. In patients on chronic dopaminergic treatment, peak-dose dystonia, diphasic dystonia and off-dystonia can be seen. The later constitutes the major dystonic feature of chronic levodopa therapy, and a wide variety of strategies are available to manage this complication. Among them, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has proved to be the most effective one. Dystonic reactions (mainly involving oculomotor cranial nerves and limbs) in operated patients (especially carriers of deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices) are increasingly being reported, constituting a new type of dystonia in patients with Parkinson's disease: dystonia linked to surgical treatment.", "pages": "239-50"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Cellular principles underlying normal and pathological activity in the subthalamic nucleus.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16123453", "authors": ["Bevan, MD", "Atherton, JF", "Baufreton, J"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Current opinion in neurobiology", "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling and least understood symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), and is usually observed in the advanced stage of the disease. FOG can be experienced on turning, in narrow spaces, whilst reaching a destination, and in stressful situations. FOG is commonly observed in the \"off\" state, but it can also be observed in the \"on\" state. Dual tasking (cognitive load) aggravates FOG. Visual or auditory cues often resolve FOG. Analysis of gait revealed that the rhythm of stepping suddenly jumps into high frequency (4-5 Hz) in FOG (hastening), and that floor reaction forces are disregulated. Stride-to-stride variability is increased in FOG. Hastening phenomenon was reported not only in PD patients but also in patients with striatal lesions. The basal ganglia and its frontal projections may be one of the essential lesion sites for FOG.A recent study using single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) revealed enhanced lateral premotor cortex (PMC) activity during paradoxical gait in PD, suggesting that PMC can compensate for the impaired function of the medial frontal cortex when cued by visual input. Treatment of FOG includes behavioural, medical, and surgical approaches. Tricks of all kinds (including external cues) are effective therapeutic approaches. If FOG occurs predominantly in the \"off\" state, dopaminergic therapy can be increased. For \"on\" freezing or if \"on\" response is otherwise optimised, the dose of the dopaminergic agent may be manipulated, but it could lead to the deterioration of parkinsonism.

It is becoming increasingly recognized as a prominent and disabling phenomenon during the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). In our experience, there is no clear correlation between camptocormia and levodopa treatment. In a few patients, the abnormal posture improved and in others it was unaltered or even became worse following levodopa administration. In a minority of fluctuating patients, there was a temporary deterioration during the \"off\" periods, but in most, the severity of camptocormia was unchanged during the \"on\" and \"off\" phases. In some patients it is associated with back pains, whereas in others it is painless. It occurs in sporadic PD as well as in postencephalitic and parkin-gene mutation PD and in other parkinsonian syndromes such as MSA. The pathogenesis of this striking clinical sign is unknown. It is definitely not due to a primary vertebral disease causing kyphosis such as ankylosing spondylitis, as the bent spine disappears when the patient lies on his back. The muscles involved may be the abdominal, paravertebral or both. It may by due to a peculiar dystonia or to an extreme form of rigidity.

The estimated prevalence in the general population of Europe seems to be lower, ranging from 1 in 330,000 to 1 in 200,000, although precise numbers are currently not available. The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined. Molecular genetic diagnostic and genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with age of onset below 26 years, and may also be considered in those with onset after 26 years having a relative with typical early onset dystonia. Treatment options include botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms, pharmacological therapy such as anticholinergics (most commonly trihexiphenydil) for generalized dystonia and surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus or intrathecal baclofen application in severe cases.
