Assuming that ICSS improves learning and memory increasing the activation of memory-related brain areas, the present work examined whether rats receiving an ICSS treatment immediately after the acquisition session of a two-way active avoidance conditioning (TWAA) show both an improved retention and a pattern of increased c-Fos and Nurr1 protein expression in the amygdala, hippocampus, dorsal striatum and/or lateral hypothalamus. The response of both activity-induced IEGs to ICSS was examined not only as markers of neural activation, but because of their reported role in the neural plasticity occurring during learning and memory formation. Results showed that the TWAA conditioning alone increased the expression of the two analysed IEGs in several hippocampal areas, and TWAA retention increased Nurr1 expression in amygdala. ICSS treatment increased the number of c-Fos and Nurr1 positive cells in almost all the brain regions studied when it was measured 70min, but not 48h, after the stimulation. Post-training ICSS treatment, as expected, facilitated the 48h retention of the conditioning. It is noteworthy that in CA3 conditioning and ICSS separately increased c-Fos expression, but this increasing was greater when both, conditioning and ICSS, were combined. Present results suggest that rapid and transient increased expression of these two synaptic plasticity and memory related IEGs in some hippocampal areas, such as CA3, could mediate the facilitative effects of ICSS on learning and memory consolidation.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Deep Brain Stimulation Targeted at the Nucleus Accumbens Decreases the Potential for Pathologic Network Communication.", "issue": "", "pmid": "23623188", "authors": ["Smolders, R", "Mazaheri, A", "van Wingen, G", "Figee, M", "de Koning, PP", "Denys, D"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Biological psychiatry", "abstract": "There are many children with intractable epilepsy who do not respond to anticonvulsant medications yet are not candidates for resective epilepsy surgery.

One factor that could play a role in the proper delivery of therapeutic stimulation by current DBS devices is the variability of the impedance at the interface between the electrode surface and surrounding tissue. OBJECTIVE: To analyze variability and trends in the impedance of chronically-implanted DBS electrodes in subjects with movement disorders. METHODS: We reviewed impedance values from medical records of DBS patients at an academic tertiary-care movement disorders center. The standard deviation of data recorded within individual subjects and single contacts were used as measures of longitudinal impedance variability. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) determined if a number of effects had significant influences on impedance. RESULTS: We analyzed 2863 impedance measurements from 94 subjects. Median variability, for subjects with follow-up from 6 months to 5 years (n\u00a0=\u00a077), was 194\u00a0\u03a9 for individual subjects and 141\u00a0\u03a9 for individual contacts, with a range spanning from 18 to over 600\u00a0\u03a9. The GLMM, incorporating all subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a094), identified time, electrical activity, implanted target, contact position on the electrode and side of implantation as significant predictors of impedance. Age and disease duration at surgery, gender or ethnicity were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that a significant amount of impedance variability can be expected in chronically implanted DBS electrodes and indicates a number of factors with possible predictive value.

Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long latency afferent inhibition (LAI) measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to measure sensorimotor integration. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been found to restore these abnormalities, but the time course of these changes is not known. We prospectively evaluated the short-term and long-term effects of STN DBS on SAI, LAI and proprioception. We hypothesised plasticity changes induced by chronic stimulation are necessary to normalise sensorimotor integration and proprioception. METHODS: Patients with PD were studied preoperatively, at 1 month and more than 6 months postoperatively. SAI was tested with median nerve stimulation to the wrist preceding TMS pulse to motor cortex by \u223c20 ms and LAI by 200 ms. Proprioception (distance and spatial errors) in the arm was quantitatively assessed. For postoperative assessments, patients were studied in the medication-off/stimulator-off, medication-off/stimulator-on, medication-on/stimulator-off and medication-on/stimulator-on conditions. RESULTS: 11 patients with PD and 10 controls were enrolled. Preoperatively, SAI and proprioception was abnormal during the medication-on conditions and LAI was reduced regardless of the medication status. STN DBS had no significant effect on SAI, LAI and proprioception at 1 month. However, at 6 months SAI, LAI and distance errors were normalised in the medication-on/stimulator-on condition.

Here, in humans undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation surgery, we use the novel technique of subdural electrocorticography in combination with subthalamic nucleus (STN) single-unit recording to study basal ganglia-cortex interactions at the millisecond time scale. We show that in patients with PD, STN spiking is synchronized with primary motor cortex (M1) local field potentials in two distinct patterns: first, STN spikes are phase-synchronized with M1 rhythms in the theta, alpha, or beta (4-30 Hz) bands. Second, STN spikes are synchronized with M1 gamma activity over a broad spectral range (50-200 Hz). The amplitude of STN spike-synchronized gamma activity in M1 is itself rhythmically modulated by the phase of a lower-frequency rhythm (phase-amplitude coupling), such that \"waves\" of phase-synchronized gamma activity precede the occurrence of STN spikes. We show the disease specificity of these phenomena in PD, by comparison with STN-M1 paired recordings performed in a group of patients with a different disorder, primary craniocervical dystonia.

Direct modulation of the NAS with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure currently under investigation in humans for the treatment of major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and addiction, may also be effective in ameliorating binge eating. Therefore, we examined the ability of DBS of the NAS to block this behavior in mice. c-Fos immunoreactivity was assessed as a marker of DBS-mediated neuronal activation. NAS DBS was found to reduce binge eating and increased c-Fos levels in this region. DBS of the dorsal striatum had no influence on this behavior, demonstrating anatomical specificity for this effect. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride, attenuated the action of DBS, whereas the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH-23390, was ineffective, suggesting that dopamine signaling involving D2 receptors underlies the effect of NAS DBS. To determine the potential translational relevance to the obese state, chronic NAS DBS was also examined in diet-induced obese mice and was found to acutely reduce caloric intake and induce weight loss.

Deep brain stimulation in epilepsy has targeted gray matter structures using high frequencies, but achieved limited success. We tested the hypothesis that low-frequency stimulation of the fornix reduces interictal epileptiform discharges and seizures in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, without affecting memory. Methods: We implanted depth electrodes in 11 patients for surgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. Low frequency stimulation of the fornix occurred in 4-hour sessions in the video-EEG unit. Mental status assessment was performed at baseline and during stimulation. We studied the effect of stimulation on hippocampal spikes and seizures. Results: There were no complications and the patients were unaware of the stimulation. Fornix stimulation elicited evoked responses in the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Hourly mini-mental status examination scores showed an increase during stimulation when compared to pre-stimulation MMSE, largely due to improvement in recall, possibly representing a practice effect. Hippocampal spikes were significantly reduced during and outlasting each stimulation session. Seizure odds (n=7) were reduced by 92% in the 2 days that followed stimulation. Interpretation: Low frequency stimulation of the fornix activates the hippocampus and other areas of the declarative memory circuit. The results of this preliminary study suggest that low-frequency stimulation is tolerable and reduces epileptiform discharges and seizures in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

The symposium speakers - Michael Greenberg, Erin Schuman, Chiara Cirelli, Michael Meaney, Catherine Dulac, Hopi Hoekstra, and Stanislas Dehaene - covered topics ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems level and behavior. Thus a single amino acid change in a transcriptional repressor can disrupt gene regulation through neural activity (Greenberg). Deep sequencing analysis of the neuropil transcriptome indicates that a large fraction of the synaptic proteome is synthesized in situ in axons and dendrites, permitting local regulation (Schuman). The nature of the 'reset' function that makes animals dependent of sleep is being revealed (Cirelli). Maternal behavior can cause changes in gene expression that stably modify behavior in the offspring (Meaney). Removal of a single sensory channel protein in the vomero-nasal organ can switch off male-specific and switch on female-specific innate behavior of mice in response to environmental stimulation (Dulac). Innate behaviors can be stably transmitted from parent to offspring through generations even when those behaviors cannot be expressed, as illustrated by the elaborate burrowing behavior in a rodent species, in which independent genetic regions regulate distinct modules of the burrowing pattern (Hoekstra). Finally, at the other extreme of the nature-nurture scale, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis in children and adults identified a brain area specifically involved in reading (Dehaene).

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to assess changes in aversive and appetitive motivational activation using modulation of the acoustic blink reflex (ABR) by rewarding and aversive stimuli. METHODS: ABR elicited during the viewing of erotic, food, aversive and neutral pictures was recorded in 11 off-medicated patients with the subthalamic stimulation switched ON and OFF, and in 11 control subjects. RESULTS: ABR to erotic stimuli was larger in patients in the ON compared to the OFF condition and controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Aversive stimuli caused a larger increase in the ABR in patients with the ON condition than in controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, we found a negative correlation of the ABR magnitude to food pictures in the ON condition with weight gain following subthalamic stimulation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, after adjustment to OFF condition). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that subthalamic stimulation affects motivational processing. Subthalamic stimulation may disturb appetitive engagement by erotic cues and increase aversive activation in PD patients.

Sleep in mammals is a dynamic process involving different stages of sleep intensity, and these are typically associated with measurable changes in brain activity (Blake and Gerard, 1937; Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Webb and Agnew, 1971). Evidence for different sleep stages in invertebrates remains elusive, even though it has been well established that many invertebrate species require sleep (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2003). Here we used electrophysiology and arousal-testing paradigms to show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transitions between deeper and lighter sleep within extended bouts of inactivity, with deeper sleep intensities after \u223c15 and \u223c30 min of inactivity. As in mammals, the timing and intensity of these dynamic sleep processes in flies is homeostatically regulated and modulated by behavioral experience. Two molecules linked to synaptic plasticity regulate the intensity of the first deep sleep stage. Optogenetic upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate during the day increases sleep intensity at night, whereas loss of function of a molecule involved in synaptic pruning, the fragile-X mental retardation protein, increases sleep intensity during the day. Our results show that sleep is not homogenous in insects, and suggest that waking behavior and the associated synaptic plasticity mechanisms determine the timing and intensity of deep sleep stages in Drosophila.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "340", "title": "Injectable, cellular-scale optoelectronics with applications for wireless optogenetics.", "issue": "6129", "pmid": "23580530", "authors": ["Kim, TI", "McCall, JG", "Jung, YH", "Huang, X", "Siuda, ER", "Li, Y", "Song, J", "Song, YM", "Pao, HA", "Kim, RH", "Lu, C", "Lee, SD", "Song, IS", "Shin, G", "Al-Hasani, R", "Kim, S", "Tan, MP", "Huang, Y", "Omenetto, FG", "Rogers, JA", "Bruchas, MR"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "Increased oscillations in the beta band are thought to be related to motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Late-stage PD patients have deficits in saccades in addition to difficulties with limb movements arising from impaired functions of the BG. We investigated saccade-related changes in beta-band (15-30 Hz) oscillatory activities in the human STN while PD patients performed visually guided prosaccades and antisaccades, the latter requiring suppression of reflexive responses and volitional initiation of saccades. We recorded local field potentials from deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted in the STN in human PD patients 1-5 d after surgery and compared prosaccades and antisaccades with these and with limb movements. Saccade-related beta-band desynchronizations were observed just before and during saccades in all subjects, suggesting that reduction of beta-band oscillatory activity in the STN is related to preparation and execution of saccades. Furthermore, beta-band desynchronizations for antisaccades started earlier, were sustained for longer periods, were of greater magnitude, and were observed more often than prosaccades.

METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, consecutive PD outpatients fulfilling criteria for DDS were assessed over a 6-year period (2005-2011). They were compared with 70 PD cases matched for age at onset, gender and disease duration, and with 1281 subjects with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. DDS patients and matched controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Strategies for DDS patients management and the outcome at the last follow-up visit were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with DDS were identified, reporting history of depression, family history of PD and drug abuse, greater difference between 'Off' versus 'On' motor symptoms compared to age-matched controls.

PD patients are known to have deficits in proprioception, but the effects are often subtle, with paradigms typically restricted to one or two joint movements in a plane. Moreover, the effects of STN DBS on proprioception are virtually unexplored. We tested the following hypotheses: first, that PD patients will show substantial deficits in unconstrained, multi-joint proprioception, and, second, that STN DBS will improve multi-joint proprioception. Twelve PD patients with bilaterally implanted electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus and 12 age-matched healthy subjects were asked to position the left hand at a location that was proprioceptively defined in 3D space with the right hand. In a second condition, subjects were provided visual feedback during the task so that they were not forced to rely on proprioception. Overall, with STN DBS switched off, PD patients showed significantly larger proprioceptive localization errors, and greater variability in endpoint localizations than the control subjects. Visual feedback partially normalized PD performance, and demonstrated that the errors in proprioceptive localization were not simply due to a difficulty in executing the movements or in remembering target locations. Switching STN DBS on significantly reduced localization errors from those of control subjects when patients moved without visual feedback relative to when they moved with visual feedback (when proprioception was not required). However, this reduction in localization errors without vision came at the cost of increased localization variability.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "27", "title": "Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: impact of the disorder and of treatment.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "23580175", "authors": ["Subramaniam, M", "Soh, P", "Vaingankar, JA", "Picco, L", "Chong, SA"], "year": "2013", "journal": "CNS drugs", "abstract": "Neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD), have become a promising field for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).

Less is known about the effect of stimulation on cognitive function and the capacity to walk while dual tasking, an ability that has been related to fall risk. Everyday walking takes place in complex environments that often require multi-tasking. Hence, dual tasking gait performance reflects everyday ambulation as well as gait automaticity. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of sub-thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on dual task walking in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Gait was assessed using a performance-based test and by quantifying single-task and dual task walking conditions in 28 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. These tests were conducted in 4 conditions: \"off\" medication, with the stimulator turned on and off, and \"on\" medication, with the stimulator turned on and off. A previously validated, computerized neuro-psychological battery assessed executive function, attention and memory \"off\" and \"on\" deep brain stimulation, after subjects took their anti-Parkinsonian medications. RESULTS: Stimulation improved motor function and the spatiotemporal parameters of gait (e.g., gait speed) during both single-task and dual task walking conditions. Attention improved, but executive function did not. The dual task effect on gait did not change in response to stimulation. For example, during serial 3 subtractions, gait speed was reduced by -0.20 +/- 0.14 while off DBS and off meds and by -0.22 +/- 0.14 m/sec when the DBS was turned on (p = 0.648). Similarly, on medication, serial 3 subtractions reduced gait speed by -0.20 +/- 0.16 m/sec off DBS and by -0.22 +/- 0.09 m/sec on DBS (p = 0.543). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral sub-thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves motor symptoms, certain features of gait and even some aspects of cognitive function. However, stimulation apparently fails to reduce the negative impact of a dual task on walking abilities.

OCD commonly affects young adults, is associated with other comorbid mental illnesses and often has a large treatment gap (the proportion of individuals who have OCD and require care but do not receive treatment). OCD thus runs a chronic and disabling course which compromises an individual's functioning and well-being and ultimately has a rather detrimental impact on the lives of both patients and their families. Researchers and clinicians are increasingly paying attention to humanistic outcomes to encompass broader indicators of disease burden and outcome, one of which is quality of life (QoL). In this review, we provide a summary of the current knowledge of QoL in OCD, its socio-demographic and clinical correlates, and the effects of therapeutic interventions on QoL among those with OCD. Overall, studies indicate that those with OCD had diminished QoL across all domains relative to normative comparison subjects. Patients with OCD scored better on QoL domains than patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), whereas they showed no difference or scored worse than patients with schizophrenia. Although research on socio-demographic correlates of QoL in OCD is largely contradictory, most studies suggest that symptom severity and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms are predictors of decreased QoL in OCD, with numerous studies showing this association across multiple domains associated with QoL. Studies assessing QoL as an outcome of treatment have found an improvement in QoL in people with OCD after treatment with pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy with some studies suggesting that this improvement in QoL is correlated with improvement in symptoms. A few studies have also evaluated other forms of treatment like partial hospitalisation programmes and deep brain stimulation for those with treatment-resistant OCD and found that QoL scores improve with treatment. A major gap in the field is the lack of instruments that measure QoL specifically in patients with OCD. It is evident that OCD affects specific domains and thus there is a pressing need for the development of multidimensional instruments that are reliable and valid. There is also a need for studies assessing QoL in individuals with OCD among both clinical and community samples with adequate sample size to examine socio-demographic and clinical correlates simultaneously. These populations ought to be followed longitudinally to examine QoL with the clinical course of the illness, and to help establish temporal relationships. Studies that examine improvements in QoL with treatment need to be designed carefully: sample size requirements should be met, raters must be blinded, and randomly assigning subjects to different arms would ensure that some of the inherent biases in open-label studies are avoided.

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation compared with long-term medical treatment. We performed a cost-utility analysis using a lifetime Markov model for Parkinson's disease. Health utilities were evaluated using the EQ-5D generic health status measure. Data on effectiveness and adverse events were obtained from clinical studies, published reports, or meta-analyses. Costs were assessed from the German health care provider perspective. Both were discounted at 3% per year. Key assumptions affecting costs and health status were investigated using one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses.

This study used a nonhuman primate (Macaca fuscata) model of BG-meditated motor tics, and investigated the short-term neuronal mechanism that might underlie the beneficial effects of GPi-HF-DBS. In parallel with behavioral tic expressions, phasic alterations of neuronal activity emerged in the pallidum following focal disinhibition of the striatum with bicuculline. We delivered HF-DBS in the GPi in such a way that on-stimulation and off-stimulation conditions alternated every 30 s. Analysis of electromyographic (EMG) records showed that during on-stimulation, there were significant reductions in tic-related EMG amplitude. Analysis of pallidal activity showed that GPi-HF-DBS induced both sustained and transient patterns of excitation and inhibition in both segments of the GP. Population-scale firing rates were initially raised relative to baseline, but were not significantly different by the time stimulation ceased. Modulation of behavior and neuronal firing rates were associated with the reduction of tic-related phasic activity in pallidal cells. Examination of short-latency responses showed that firing rate changes were strongly associated with locking of the cells' activity with the HF-DBS pulse. This temporal locking often induced multiphasic changes of firing rates in individual cells, which dynamically changed across the stimulation period. These results support clinical studies that reported success in treating motor tics with GPi-HF-DBS, and demonstrate that the underlying local mechanism within the GP is suppression of tic-related activity through temporal locking with the stimulation pulse.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation with a new device in Parkinson's disease: an open-label trial.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "20069392", "authors": ["Liu, HG", "Ma, Y", "Zhang, K", "Ge, M", "Meng, FG", "Feng, T", "Wan, XH", "Guo, Y", "Wang, RZ", "Yang, AC", "Hu, WH", "Guo, JZ", "Zhang, JG"], "year": "", "journal": "Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society", "abstract": "Research indicated that: (i) vaginal orgasm (induced by penile-vaginal intercourse [PVI] without concurrent clitoral masturbation) consistency (vaginal orgasm consistency [VOC]; percentage of PVI occasions resulting in vaginal orgasm) is associated with mental attention to vaginal sensations during PVI, preference for a longer penis, and indices of psychological and physiological functioning, and (ii) clitoral, distal vaginal, and deep vaginal/cervical stimulation project via different peripheral nerves to different brain regions.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Gender differences in quality of life following subthalamic stimulation for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "20084552", "authors": ["Hariz, GM", "Limousin, P", "Zrinzo, L", "Tripoliti, E", "Aviles-Olmos, I", "Jahanshahi, M", "Hamberg, K", "Foltynie, T"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine the association of VOC with: (i) sexual arousability perceived from deep vaginal stimulation (compared with middle and shallow vaginal stimulation and clitoral stimulation), and (ii) whether vaginal stimulation was present during the woman's first masturbation.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "91", "title": "Use of pallidal deep brain stimulation in postinfarct hemidystonia.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "20349573", "authors": ["Witt, J", "Starr, PA", "Ostrem, JL"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "A sample of 75 Czech women (aged 18-36), provided details of recent VOC, site of genital stimulation during first masturbation, and their recent sexual arousability from the four genital sites.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "91", "title": "Unilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation in a patient with dystonia secondary to episodic ataxia type 2.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "20353885", "authors": ["Harries, AM", "Sandhu, M", "Spacey, SD", "Aly, MM", "Honey, CR"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "The association of VOC with: (i) sexual arousability perceived from the four genital sites and (ii) involvement of vaginal stimulation in first-ever masturbation.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "91", "title": "Chronic evaluation of a clinical system for deep brain stimulation and recording of neural network activity.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "20600245", "authors": ["Stypulkowski, PH", "Stanslaski, SR", "Denison, TJ", "Giftakis, JE"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "VOC was associated with greater sexual arousability from deep vaginal stimulation but not with sexual arousability from other genital sites.

The authors present the 2-year safety results as well as early efficacy and metabolic effects in 3 patients undergoing bilateral LHA DBS in the first study of this approach in humans. Methods Three patients meeting strict criteria for intractable obesity, including failed bariatric surgery, underwent bilateral implantation of LHA DBS electrodes as part of an institutional review board- and FDA-approved pilot study. The primary focus of the study was safety; however, the authors also received approval to collect data on early efficacy including weight change and energy metabolism. Results No serious adverse effects, including detrimental psychological consequences, were observed with continuous LHA DBS after a mean follow-up of 35 months (range 30-39 months). Three-dimensional nonlinear transformation of postoperative imaging superimposed onto brain atlas anatomy was used to confirm and study DBS contact proximity to the LHA. No significant weight loss trends were seen when DBS was programmed using standard settings derived from movement disorder DBS surgery. However, promising weight loss trends have been observed when monopolar DBS stimulation has been applied via specific contacts found to increase the resting metabolic rate measured in a respiratory chamber. Conclusions Deep brain stimulation of the LHA may be applied safely to humans with intractable obesity. Early evidence for some weight loss under metabolically optimized settings provides the first \"proof of principle\" for this novel antiobesity strategy.

These LFP recordings have numerous clinical implications and might someday be used to optimize DBS outcomes in closed-loop systems. However, the origin of the recorded LFP is poorly understood. Therefore, the goal of this study was to theoretically analyze LFP recordings within the context of clinical DBS applications. This goal was achieved with a detailed recording model of beta oscillations (\u223c20 Hz) in the subthalamic nucleus. The recording model consisted of finite element models of intraoperative microelectrodes and DBS macroelectrodes implanted in the brain along with multi-compartment cable models of STN projection neurons. Model analysis permitted systematic investigation into a number of variables that can affect the composition of the recorded LFP (e.g. electrode size, electrode impedance, recording configuration, and filtering effects of the brain, electrode-electrolyte interface, and recording electronics). The results of the study suggest that the spatial reach of the LFP can extend several millimeters. Model analysis also showed that variables such as electrode geometry and recording configuration can have a significant effect on LFP amplitude and spatial reach, while the effects of other variables, such as electrode impedance, are often negligible.

Although the pathophysiology of gambling remains unclear, several findings argue for a dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuits. To clarify the role of the subthalamic nucleus in pathological gambling, we studied its activity during economics decisions. We analyzed local field potentials recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus while parkinsonian patients with (n\u2009=\u20098) and without (n\u2009=\u20099) pathological gambling engaged in an economics decision-making task comprising conflictual trials (involving possible risk-taking) and non conflictual trials. In all parkinsonian patients, subthalamic low frequencies (2-12 Hz) increased during economics decisions. Whereas, in patients without gambling, low-frequency oscillations exhibited a similar pattern during conflictual and non conflictual stimuli, in those with gambling, low-frequency activity increased significantly more during conflictual than during non conflictual stimuli. The specific low-frequency oscillatory pattern recorded in patients with Parkinson's disease who gamble could reflect a subthalamic dysfunction that makes their decisional threshold highly sensitive to risky options. When parkinsonian patients process stimuli related to an economics task, low-frequency subthalamic activity increases. This task-related change suggests that the cognitive-affective system that drives economics decisional processes includes the subthalamic nucleus. The specific subthalamic neuronal activity during conflictual decisions in patients with pathological gambling supports the idea that the subthalamic nucleus is involved in behavioral strategies and in the pathophysiology of gambling. \u00a9 2013 Movement Disorder Society.", "pages": "46-57"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for essential tremor: a proof-of-concept study.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "15607296", "authors": ["Lipsman, N", "Schwartz, ML", "Huang, Y", "Lee, L", "Sankar, T", "Chapman, M", "Hynynen, K", "Lozano, AM"], "year": "2013", "journal": "Lancet neurology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) significantly reduces symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity.

Here, we investigate possible differences between women and men undergoing STN DBS, with respect to health-related quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients (18 women) received STN DBS. The impact of PD and its surgical treatment was compared between women and men, before and at mean of 19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0months after surgery, using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). RESULTS: Duration of disease at surgery and off-medication scores of the motor part of the UPDRS were similar in women and men. At baseline, women had lower doses of dopaminergic medication than men, experienced more disability due to dyskinesias, had more sensory symptoms and perceived more difficulties in mobility. Following DBS, both men and women showed equal and significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) improvement in off-medication scores on the UPDRS III. On the PDQ-39, women expressed improvement in ADL to a greater extent than men. Moreover, women but not men showed a positive effect on mobility, stigma and cognition as well as on the summary score of PDQ-39.
