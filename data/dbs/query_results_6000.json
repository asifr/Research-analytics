The binding potential of the dopamine D2 receptors of these patients was determined before and after surgery by using positron emission tomography scanning with 11C-nemonapride and it was compared with the value in eight healthy volunteers. The authors also examined whether changes in the D2 receptor binding potential were correlated with the clinical outcome. The clinical symptoms, especially those in the off state, were significantly improved after surgery. Preoperatively, the D2 receptor binding potential in the putamen was elevated by 27% (p < 0.01) and that in the thalamus was 29% lower than that in controls (p < 0.01). The D2 receptor binding potential in the putamen and thalamus returned to control levels after surgery. The preoperative level of the D2 receptor binding potential in the anterior cingulate cortex was comparable to that of controls, but it declined significantly after surgery, whereas the D2 receptor binding potential in other regions of both hemispheres showed no significant changes after surgery.

It proved effective in several models of epilepsy and was then tried in short-term, open-label and double-blind trials, leading to approval in Canada, Europe and the US. Follow-up observations in these patients demonstrated continued improvement in seizure control for up to 2 years. Close to 50% of treated patients have achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. This therapy was also useful as rescue therapy for ongoing seizures in some patients; many patients are more alert. The initial trials were completed in patients >/=12 years of age with refractory partial seizures. Subsequently, similar benefits were shown in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, hypothalamic hamartomas and primary generalised seizures. Implanting the generator and leads is technically easy, and complications are few. The method of action is largely unknown, although VNS appears to alter metabolic activity in specific brain nuclei. Considering that improvement in mood is frequently found in patients using VNS, it has undergone trials in patients with depression. Other illnesses deserving exploration with this unusual therapy are Alzheimer's disease and autism. Some aspects of VNS have proven disappointing. Although patients have fewer seizures, the number of antiepileptic drugs they take is not significantly reduced. In addition, there is no way to accurately predict the end of life of the generator. Optimal stimulation parameters, if they exist, are unknown. Deep brain stimulation is a new method for controlling medically refractory seizures. It is based on the observation that thalamic stimulation can influence the EEG over a wide area. Several thalamic nuclei have been the object of stimulation in different groups of patients.

Our experience also suggests that there is still a role for DBS in the control of central pain. Here we present a series of eight consecutive cases of intractable chronic pain of central origin treated with PVG DBS with an average follow-up of 9 months. In each case, two electrodes were implanted in the PVG and the ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus, respectively, under guidance of corneal topography/magnetic resonance imaging image fusion. The PVG was stimulated in the frequency range of 2-100 Hz in alert patients while pain was assessed using the McGill-Melzack visual analogue scale. In addition, local field potentials (FPs) were recorded from the sensory thalamus during PVG stimulation. Maximum pain relief was obtained with 5-35 Hz stimulation while 50-100 Hz made the pain worse. This suggests that pain suppression was frequency dependent. Interestingly, we detected low frequency thalamic FPs at 0.2-0.4 Hz closely associated with the pain. During 5-35 Hz PVG stimulation the amplitude of this potential was significantly reduced and this was associated with marked pain relief. At the higher frequencies (50-100 Hz), however, there was no reduction in the FPs and no pain suppression. We have found an interesting and consistent correlation between thalamic electrical activity and chronic pain. This low frequency potential may provide an objective index for quantifying chronic pain, and may hold further clues to the mechanism of action of PVG stimulation.

We discuss in the present paper, the possible physiological or pathological roles of oscillatory activities within the basal ganglia, and their relationship to cortical oscillations. Three aspects are presented: 1. What do we know from animal studies? 2. What do we know from neurophysiological studies in parkinsonian patients? 3. What is the effect of L-dopa treatment and electrical stimulation within basal ganglia circuits on cortical oscillations? Animal studies suggest that neuronal oscillations are spontaneously generated within the basal ganglia system, especially from the GPE and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but are mainly synchronized by cortical activity via the striatal inputs. Dopamine depletion results in a global increase of oscillations within the whole basal ganglia system, particularly in the GP-NST network. Oscillations within the basal ganglia may, in part, be related to tremor since they are enhanced, especially in the globus pallidus internus (GPI) and the STN, in human and animal dopaminergic depletion. However, they also play a role in the physiology of movement as revealed by coherence analysis between cortex, muscles and GPI/STN in parkinsonian patients undergoing deep brain stimulation. It is known that the basal ganglia may influence cortico-muscular oscillations such as the Piper rhythm and other rhythms in the beta band. In off-drug parkinsonian patients, low frequency oscillations (4-10 Hz) are favoured, presumably resulting in bradykinesia and low force. When medically (Ldopa) or surgically (deep brain stimulation) treated, these low frequency oscillations are replaced by high frequency (70 Hz) oscillations that are important for motor programs to be correctly executed.

In contrast, the primary cortical SEP component (N20) was significantly increased under succinylcholine (+17%). This cortical release from gating was not paralleled, however, by an increased thalamic response; rather, the primary thalamic response (P16) showed a slight (-9%) but highly significant amplitude reduction. As the recordings were performed in narcotised patients, any potentially variable attentional bias on part of the subjects can be excluded as confounding factor when comparing the two experimental conditions with vs. without reafferent somatosensory inflow. Thus, given the high signal-to-noise ratio of intrathalamically recorded SEP, the present study shows a distinct thalamo-cortical dissociation with the primary somatosensory cortex representing the predominant level exhibiting SEP gating.", "pages": "57-63"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Localization of clinically effective stimulating electrodes in the human subthalamic nucleus on magnetic resonance imaging.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "12522571", "authors": ["Saint-Cyr, JA", "Hoque, T", "Pereira, LC", "Dostrovsky, JO", "Hutchison, WD", "Mikulis, DJ", "Abosch, A", "Sime, E", "Lang, AE", "Lozano, AM"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still contraindicated in patients with implanted active medical devices, as the applied radiofrequency (RF) fields can lead to significant heating of the implants and the electrodes.

Initially positron emission tomography (PET) and now functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are causing a paradigm shift in psychiatry and the neurosciences. Psychiatry is abandoning the pharmacological model of 'brain as soup', used for much of the past 20 years. Instead, there is new realization that both normal and abnormal behavior arise from chemical processes that occur within parallel distributed networks in specific brain regions. Many of these pathological circuits are becoming well characterized, in disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease, to obsessive-compulsive disorder, to depression. Most recently, there has been an explosion of new techniques that allow for direct stimulation of these brain circuits, without the need for open craniotomy and neurosurgical ablation. The techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This review will describe these new tools, and overview their current and future potential for research and clinical neuropsychiatric use. The psychiatry of the future will be better grounded in a firm understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology (as well as pharmacology).

For this, activation of either the rostral or caudal parts of the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus was applied in a genetic model of absence seizures in the rat (GAERS). Single-shock (5 s) electrical stimulation of the rostral and caudal superior colliculus interrupted ongoing spike-and-wave discharges at an intensity (antiepileptic threshold) significantly lower than the intensity inducing behavioral effects. At this intensity, no interruption of licking behavior was observed in water-deprived rats. Repeated stimulations (5 s on/5 s off) at the antiepileptic threshold reduced absence seizures only during the first 10 min. Bilateral microinjection of a GABA antagonist (picrotoxin, 33 pmol/side) significantly suppressed spike-and-wave discharges when applied in the caudal aspect of the superior colliculus. This antiepileptic effect appears dissociated from an anxiogenic effect, as tested in an elevated plus maze test. Finally, bilateral injection of picrotoxin (33 pmol/side) appeared more effective in the superficial and intermediate layers of the caudal superior colliculus, whereas such injections had only weak effects on absence seizures when applied in the deep layers.

All of the cells tested responded well to a test spot moving across their receptive fields. When a background pattern was moved in the same or in a similar direction as that of the test spot, the responses of most deep tectal neurons to the test spot were maximally inhibited. Movement of the background in the opposite or near opposite direction produced minimal inhibition or even facilitation. For some deep tectal neurons, this directionally selective modulation by the moving background was maintained when the background motion was paired with different movement directions of the test spot (including both the preferred and least preferred directions). Thus, this selectivity for opposing motion was independent of the absolute direction of either the test spot or the background, a finding which is consistent with the results reported by Frost and Nakayama (1983), although they did not include all test spot directions. For some other neurons, identified here for the first time, the background movement selectively modulated the response only when the test spot moved in the neuron's preferred directions. These neurons lost selectivity for opposing motion when the test spot moved in nonpreferred directions.

Further, experiments in anaesthetised rats, using the expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos, as a marker of neuronal activation, report that pain arising from muscles, joints or viscera selectively activates the vlPAG.

Specifically: (i) injection of algesic substances into muscle, which preferentially activates spinal afferents, evoked Fos expression predominantly within the caudal vlPAG; whereas, (ii) noxious manipulations whose effects are mediated by (cardiopulmonary) vagal activation evoked preferential Fos-expression within the rostral vlPAG.

Eighty-seven IN cells were recorded from 38 slices. The vast majority of the cells responded to histamine stimulation with an excitatory response (79/87, 90.8%), and the rest of them showed no reaction (8/87, 9.2%). The histamine-induced excitation was not blocked by application of low-Ca(2+)/high-Mg(2+) medium (n=8), supporting a direct postsynaptic action of histamine. The histamine H(2) receptor antagonist ranitidine effectively blocked the excitatory response of IN cells to histamine (n=23), but the histamine H(1) receptor antagonist triprolidine could not significantly block the histamine-induced excitation, or only very slightly decreased the excitatory effect of histamine on the cells (n=21). On the other hand, the highly selective histamine H(2) receptor agonist dimaprit mimicked the excitatory effect of histamine on IN cells and the dimaprit-induced excitation was also blocked by ranitidine (n=14). Successively perfusing slices with the medium containing ranitidine and triprolidine, respectively, we found that ranitidine exhibited the same blocking effect on the dimaprit-induced excitation, but triprolidine had no such effect (n=8). Moreover, the histamine H(1) receptor agonist 2-pyridylethylamine did not show any effect on the IN cells (n=9).

Parkinson's disease was the first and primary test bed for this putative new therapeutic method. Various centers performed the grafting surgery and the behavioral evaluations in different ways, and observed a varying degree of symptomatic relief. This led to a plea for double blind placebo-controlled clinical trials, which have since been performed and of which the first outcomes were recently published. In the present paper this approach of experimental neurotransplantation in brain diseases is discussed and rejected. Neural grafting in the central nervous system is irreversible and is therefore not suitable for experimental approaches originally designed for and best suited to drug studies. For Parkinson's disease in particular, the technique is far from optimized to perform large-scale studies at this stage. Moreover, previous negative results of adrenal medulla tissue implantation in the brain of patients make placebo effects rather unlikely. Moral arguments concerning the validity of the informed consent, therapeutic misconception, and the risk/benefit ratio can be added in the plea against this control surgery. Finally, a recommendation is made for study designs that apply a disease-dedicated core assessment protocol (CAP) that can evaluate the period from pre-operative to post-convalescent stages quantitatively, and therefore, unbiased. The strength of these CAPs is that they allow comparisons of different grafting techniques, of results between centers and of other types of interventions and invasive treatments such as deep brain stimulation. On ethical grounds, it is unacceptable not to use a study design that circumvents sham or imitation surgery. It is a challenge for the neuroscience community to develop CAPs for brain diseases that are eligible for neurotransplantation in the future.", "pages": "57-63"}, {"volume": "69", "title": "Two advances in the management of Parkinson disease.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "12382123", "authors": ["Montgomery, EB"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine", "abstract": "Neuropsychologists are increasingly involved in surgical candidacy evaluations and postoperative neurobehavioral assessments of patients with movement disorders, most notably those with Parkinson's disease (PD).

The bipolar pulses considered here are symmetrical and consist of a positive and a negative monopolar pulse. A bipolar single pulse with the right intensity and duration desynchronizes a synchronized cluster provided the stimulus is administered at a vulnerable initial phase of the cluster's order parameter. A considerably more effective desynchronization is achieved with a bipolar double pulse consisting of two qualitatively different bipolar pulses. The first bipolar pulse is stronger and resets the cluster, so that the second bipolar pulse, which follows after a constant delay, hits the cluster in a vulnerable state and desynchronizes it. A bipolar double pulse desynchronizes the cluster independently of the cluster's dynamical state at the beginning of the stimulation. The dynamics of the order parameter during a bipolar single pulse or a bipolar double pulse is different from the dynamics during a monopolar single pulse or a monopolar double pulse. Nevertheless, concerning their desynchronizing effects the monopolar and the bipolar stimuli are comparable, respectively. This is significant for applications where bipolar stimulation is required. For example, in medicine and physiology charge-balanced stimulation is typically necessary in order to avoid tissue damage. Based on the results presented here, demand-controlled bipolar double-pulse stimulation is suggested as a milder and more efficient therapy compared to the standard permanent high-frequency deep brain stimulation in neurological patients.", "pages": "57-63"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Desynchronization of brain rhythms with soft phase-resetting techniques.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12378074", "authors": ["Tass, PA"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Biological cybernetics", "abstract": "The effect of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation on cortical electroencephalographic activity was examined in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 4 patients with epilepsy.
