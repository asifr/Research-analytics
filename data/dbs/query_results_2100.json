Here we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from various \"deep\" brain nuclei during exercise tasks designed to elicit the muscle pressor reflex. The patients studied had undergone neurosurgery for the treatment of movement or pain disorders, thus had electrodes implanted stereotactically either in the PAG, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus interna, thalamus, hypothalamus, or anterior cingulate cortex.

The aim of this paper was to critically review available data with respect to (1) the presence of PPTg neurons linked to reticulospinal projections, (2) the involvement of these neurons in modulating spinal reflexes, and (3) the participation of fibers close to or within the PPTg region in such modulation. The PPTg neurons are distributed in a large pontotegmental region, stimulation of which can evoke activity in hindlimb, shoulder and neck muscles, and potentiate motor responses evoked by stimulation of dorsal roots. This influence seems to be carried out by fast-conducting descending fibers, which likely run in the medial reticulospinal pathway. It is yet unclear which neurotransmitters are involved and on which elements of the gray matter of the spinal cord PPTg fibers synapse. The modulation of spinal cord activity which can be achieved by stimulating the PPTg region seems to be mediated not only by PPTg neurons, but also by tecto-reticular fibers which run in the pontotegmental area, and which likely are activated during PPTg-DBS. The importance of these fibers is discussed taking into account the degeneration of PPTg neurons in PD and the benefits in gait and postural control that PPTg-DBS exerts in PD.

The vast majority of the trials conducted on the technique have evaluated the efficacy of high-frequency rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using a set of parameters very similar to those originally described in the mid-1990s. This 'standard' form of rTMS clearly appears to have antidepressant efficacy, and its effects have now been confirmed in several large-scale clinical trials and a number of meta-analyses: response is better than that of sham stimulation, although the number of responders to treatment is relatively modest. A wide range of alternative forms of rTMS have been, or are currently being, evaluated. Low-frequency stimulation applied to the right prefrontal cortex appears to have similar efficacy to standard treatment and it is possible that the bilateral approaches may prove more effective. Novel methods of stimulation, such as priming stimulation, theta-burst stimulation and deep TMS, appear to be promising although require further evaluation.

Viscerosensory symptoms were elicited by more anterior electrode contacts with a subgroup of gustatory symptoms occurring after stimulation of electrode contacts in the central part of the insula.

If movement is encoded by patterns of activity then these may be disrupted by influences at once more subtle and more devastating than the increase or decrease of neuronal firing that dominate the usual models of the circuit. In the absence of dopamine the compositional capabilities of cell assemblies in the network could be disrupted by the generation of dominant synchronous activity that engages most of the system. Experimental evidence about Parkinson's disease suggests that dopamine loss produces abnormal patterns of activity in different nuclei. For example, increased oscillatory activity arises in the GPe, GPi, and STN and is reflected as increased cortical beta frequency coherence disrupting the ability to produce motor sequences. When the idea of deep brain stimulation was proposed - it was supported by the information that lesions of the subthalamus reversed the effects of damage to the dopamine input to the system. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that the stimulation acts by silencing the nucleus as was at first proposed. Perhaps the increased cortical beta activity caused by the lack of dopamine could have disabled the patterning of network activity. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus disrupts the on-going cortical rhythms. Subsequently asynchronous firing is reinstated and striatal cell assemblies and the whole basal ganglia circuit engage in a more normal pattern of activity.

Patients were withdrawn from antiparkinsonian medication and recorded at rest. We scanned the entire brain for oscillations coherent with LFPs recorded from the STN with a frequency domain beamformer. Coherent activity in the low (12-20 Hz) and high (20-35 Hz) beta range was found in the ipsilateral sensorimotor and the premotor cortex. Coherence in the alpha range (7-12 Hz) was observed at various locations in the ipsilateral temporal lobe. In a subset of subjects, the superior temporal gyrus consistently showed coherent alpha oscillations. Our findings provide new insights into patterns of frequency-specific functional connectivity between basal ganglia and cortex and suggest that simultaneous inter-regional interactions may be segregated in the frequency domain.

In addition to its clinical importance, DBS presents a powerful approach to target specific neural circuits and determine the functional relationship between the components of these circuits. We examined the effect of high-frequency stimulation of a crucial component of the limbic circuitry, the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), on the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, another component of the same circuitry. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis emerges as a strong correlate of antidepressant treatments; however, in most cases, the progenitor cell population targeted by a specific treatment is not known. Using reporter mouse lines designed to quantify changes in selected classes of neural progenitors, we found that high-frequency stimulation of the ATN increases symmetric divisions of a defined class of neural progenitors in the DG; this effect is later manifested as an increased number of new neurons. The affected class of neural progenitors is also affected by the antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) and physical exercise (running). This indicates that neurogenic stimuli of different natures can converge on the same neurogenic target in the DG.

To this end we previously introduced the method of optimal spectral tracking (OST) in the study of trial-varying parameters. In this extension to our work we modify the OST routines to provide an adaptive implementation capable of reacting to dynamic transitions in the underlying system state. In so doing, we generalise our approach to characterise both slow-varying and rapid fluctuations in time-series, simultaneously providing a metric of system stability. The approach is first applied to a surrogate dataset and compared to both our original non-adaptive solution and spectrogram approaches. The adaptive OST is seen to display fast convergence and desirable statistical properties. All three approaches are then applied to a neurophysiological recording obtained during a study on anaesthetic monitoring.

However, the specificity by which the central nervous system detects or 'senses' peripheral immune challenges is still poorly understood. In contrast to post-mortem c-Fos mapping, we recorded neural activity in vivo in two specific cortico-limbic regions relevant for processing visceral inputs and associating it with other sensory signalling, the amygdala (Am) and the insular cortex (IC). Adult rats were implanted with deep-brain monopolar electrodes and electrical activity was monitored unilaterally before and after administration of two different immunogens, the T-cell-independent antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the T-cell-dependent antigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). In addition, the neural activity of the same individuals was analysed after single as well as repeated antigen administration, the latter inducing attenuation of the immune response. Body temperature and circulating cytokine levels confirmed the biological activity of the antigens and the success of immunization and desensitization protocols. More importantly, the present data demonstrate that neural activity of the Am and IC is not only specific for the type of immune challenge (LPS versus SEB) but seems to be also sensitive to the different immune state (naive versus desensitization). This indicates that the forebrain expresses specific patterns of electrical activity related to the type of peripheral immune activation as well as to the intensity of the stimulation, substantiating associative learning paradigms employing antigens as unconditioned stimuli.

Subsequently, the improvements in rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia were compared between unipolar and bipolar modes using 60 \u03bcs pulse-width and 130 Hz frequency.

In this paper, we conducted a rigorous study to assess whether low frequency signals can restore behavior in PD patients by restoring neural activity in the BG to the normal state. We used a biophysical-based model of BG nuclei and motor thalamus whose parameters can be set to simulate the normal state and the PD state with and without DBS. We administered pulse train DBS waveforms to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with frequencies ranging from 1-150Hz. For each DBS frequency, we computed statistics on the simulated neural activity to assess whether it is restored to the normal state. In particular, we searched for DBS waveforms that suppress pathological bursting, oscillations, correlations and synchronization prevalent in the PD state and that enable thalamic cells to relay cortical inputs reliably. We found that none of the tested waveforms restores neural activity to the normal state.

In this study, we explored the effects of striatal stimulation (SS) in a rat model of chronic-phase ischemic stroke.

Rats were evaluated behaviorally coupled with neuroradiological assessment of the infarct volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at pre- and post-SS. The rats with SS showed significant behavioral recovery in the spontaneous activity and limb placement test compared to those without SS. MRI visualized that SS also significantly reduced the infarct volumes compared to that at pre-SS or without SS. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a robust neurogenic response in rats that received SS characterized by a stream of proliferating cells from the subventricular zone migrating to and subsequently differentiating into neurons in the ischemic penumbra, which exhibited a significant GDNF upregulation. In tandem with this SS-mediated neurogenesis, enhanced angiogenesis was also recognized as revealed by a significant increase in VEGF levels in the penumbra.

This procedure has been reported to permit a stable reduction of dopaminergic therapy requirements for up to 5 years, although some expectation of deterioration in non-dopaminergic signs has been recently stated. Our aim is to perform a literature-based review of papers available describing long-term post-operative follow-up after a bilateral implant for subthalamic DBS (STN-DBS). Only peer-reviewed published papers with a post-operative follow-up of at least 5 years were considered. Clinical outcome, disease progression and side effects were assessed at baseline and 2 (or 3 years) and 5 years after surgery. Seven papers were included in the review. A total of 238 patients were analyzed. STN-DBS was confirmed to be an effective treatment for selected patients with PD. In all studies, off-related motor symptoms improved dramatically, compared with pre-implant, at 2 (or 3, according to the study) years and this result persisted at 5-year evaluations. Antiparkinsonian drug reductions, improvements in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, functional measures and the progression of underlying PD were also reported in all series. Some axial scores, in particular postural stability and speech, improved transiently. Persisting adverse effects included eyelid opening apraxia, weight gain, psychiatric disorders, depression, dysarthria, dyskinesias, and apathy. The present review of the 5-year observations confirms that STN-DBS is a powerful method in the management of PD, but its long-term effects must be thoroughly assessed.", "pages": "583-93"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Deep brain stimulation mechanisms: beyond the concept of local functional inhibition.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "10495075", "authors": ["Deniau, JM", "Degos, B", "Bosch, C", "Maurice, N"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Determining the eligibility of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be challenging for general (non-specialised) neurologists. We evaluated the use of an online screening tool (Stimulus) that aims to support appropriate referral to a specialised centre for the further evaluation of DBS. Implementation of the tool took place via an ongoing European multicentre educational programme, currently completed in 15 DBS centres with 208 referring neurologists. Use of the tool in daily practice was monitored via an online data capture programme. Selection decisions of patients referred with the assistance of the Stimulus tool were compared to those of patients outside the screening programme. Three years after the start of the programme, 3,128 patient profiles had been entered. The intention for referral was made for 802 patients and referral intentions were largely in accordance with the tool recommendations. Follow-up at 6 months showed that actual referral took place in only 28%, predominantly due to patients' reluctance to undergo brain surgery. In patients screened with the tool and referred to a DBS centre, the acceptance rate was 77%, significantly higher than that of the unscreened population (48%). The tool showed a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 12% with a positive and negative predictive value of 79 and 75%, respectively. The Stimulus tool is useful in assisting general neurologists to identify appropriate candidates for DBS consideration. The principal reason for not referring potentially eligible patients is their reluctance to undergo brain surgery.", "pages": "583-93"}]
