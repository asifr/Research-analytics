Several lines of evidence indicate that ET is associated with cerebellar dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to find corroborating evidence for this claim by investigating balance and speech impairments in patients with ET. In addition, the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on balance and speech function was studied. A group of 25 ET patients including 18 with postural and/or simple kinetic tremor (ETpt) and seven ET patients with additional clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction (ETc) was compared to 25 healthy controls. In addition, 12 ET patients with thalamic DBS participated in the study. Balance control was assessed during gait and stance including tandem gait performed on a treadmill as well as static and dynamic posturography. Motor speech control was analyzed through syllable repetition tasks. Signs of balance impairment were found in early stages and advanced stages of ET. During locomotion, ET patients exhibited an increased number of missteps and shortened stride length with tandem gait. ETc patients and, to a lesser extent, ETpt patients had increased postural instability in dynamic posturography conditions that are sensitive to vestibular or vestibulocerebellar dysfunction. ETc but not ETpt patients exhibited significantly increased syllable durations. DBS had no discernable effect on speech performance or balance control. We conclude that the deficits in balance as well as the subclinical signs of dysarthria in a subset of patients confirm and extend previous findings that ET is associated with an impairment of the cerebellum.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "The treatment of persistent vascular hemidystonia-hemiballismus with unilateral GPi deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "19126811", "authors": ["Hasegawa, H", "Mundil, N", "Samuel, M", "Jarosz, J", "Ashkan, K"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Recent anatomical and clinical evidence has shown that the cerebellum, primarily considered a motor control structure, is also involved in higher cognitive functions and behavioural changes, such as impulsive behaviour. Impulsive behaviour has been shown in several studies to be increased by lesions of the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus. We performed deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the mediodorsal and ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nuclei in rats, clinically mimicking such a lesion, and tested them for changes in impulsive behaviour in a choice reaction time test. We then analysed the effects of this stimulation on c-Fos expression in both the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCbN) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and correlated these outcomes to the measured changes in impulsive behaviour. DBS of the MD thalamic nucleus increased impulsive behaviour without changing motor parameters. This was accompanied by a decrease in the c-Fos expression in all cerebellar nuclei; with a corresponding increase in c-Fos expression in the PFC. DBS of the VL thalamic nucleus caused no significant change in behaviour or c-Fos expression in either region. The present study demonstrates that impulsive behaviour involves the cerebellar nuclei, possibly through a decreased selective attention caused by a disruption of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways through the MD thalamic nucleus.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Pallidal deep brain stimulation in \"belly dancer's dyskinesia.\".", "issue": "11", "pmid": "19452565", "authors": ["Schrader, C", "Capelle, H", "Kinfe, T", "Krauss, JK"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a new promising target of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Based on the disynaptic excitatory projections of the dentatothalamocortical pathway to the motor cortex as well as to anterior and posterior cortical areas, we hypothesize that chronic electrical stimulation of the contralesional dentate (lateral cerebellar) nucleus output can enhance motor recovery after ischemia via augmentation of perilesional cortical excitability. Seventy-five Wistar rats were pre-trained in the Montoya staircase task and subsequently underwent left cerebral ischemia with the 3-vessel occlusion model. All survivors underwent stereotactic right lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) implantation of bipolar electrodes. Rats were then randomized to 4 groups: LCN stimulation at 10 pps, 20 pps, 50 pps or sham stimulation, which was delivered for a period of 6 weeks. Performance on the Montoya staircase task was re-assessed over the last 4 weeks of the stimulation period. On the right (contralesional) side, motor performance of the groups undergoing sham, 10 pps, 20 pps and 50 pps stimulation was, respectively, 2.5+/-2.7; 2.1+/-2.5; 6.0+/-3.9 (p<0.01) and 4.5+/-3.5 pellets. There was no difference on the left (ipsilesional) side motor performance among the sham or stimulation groups, varying from 15.9+/-6.7 to 17.2+/-2.1 pellets. We conclude that contralesional chronic electrical stimulation of the lateral cerebellar nucleus at 20 pps but not at 10 or 50 pps improves motor recovery in rats following ischemic strokes. This effect is likely to be mediated by increased perilesional cortical excitability via chronic activation of the dentatothalamocortical pathway.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Implantation of a pacemaker in a patient with severe Parkinson's disease and a pre-existing bilateral deep brain stimulator.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16520330", "authors": ["Ashino, S", "Watanabe, I", "Okumura, Y", "Kofune, M", "Ohkubo, K", "Nakai, T", "Hirayama, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "abstract": "Groups performing deep brain stimulation advocate post-operative imaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT)] to analyse the position of each electrode contact.

Several independent studies have suggested a decrease in grey matter in pain-transmitting areas in migraine patients. Most of these data are discussed as damage or loss of brain grey matter, reinforcing the idea of migraine as a progressive disease. However, given what we know about the nature of morphometric changes detectable by the methods we have to date, this interpretation is highly speculative and not supported by the data. It is likely that these changes are the consequence and not the cause of the respective headache syndromes, as they are probably not irreversible and only mirror the proportion or duration of pain suffered. Moreover, structural changes are not headache specific and have to be seen in the light of a wealth of pain studies using these methods. The studies in cluster headache patients prompted the use of stereotactic stimulation of the hypothalamic target point identified by functional and structural neuroimaging. Due to the nature of the methods used and due to a high anatomical variance it is more than questionable to use this point as a definite answer to the source of the headache in clusters and even more so when it is uncritically used in individuals. We need a way to study each patient individually using the functional imaging method with the highest spatial and temporal resolution available to enable us to target the seed point for deep brain stimulation on this individual basis. One of the major future challenges is to understand the behavioural consequences and cellular mechanisms underlying neuroanatomic changes in pain and headache.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "29 Suppl 5", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "18625864", "authors": ["Marconi, R", "Landi, A", "Valzania, F"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Management of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) should benefit from improved integration between in-hospital services and home care. In Italy the number of PD hospital admissions is large but there are no guidelines of appropriateness to address queries of health authorities on resource allocation.

This could be reduced if severe patients were provided with regular nursing and rehabilitation services at their homes and neurologists were actively involved in this process. Moreover, the application of infusion therapies (apomorphine or duodenal levodopa infusion) or deep brain stimulation would require integration with home care services after patient discharge.

These results suggest that the cFN output primarily influences a neural network involved in moving the eyes in the orbit. The present study further tested this hypothesis by examining whether head movements could be evoked by electrical microstimulation of the saccade-related region in the cFN. Long stimulation trains (200-300 ms) evoked staircase gaze shifts that were ipsi- or contralateral, depending on the stimulated site. These gaze shifts were small in amplitude and were essentially accomplished by saccadic movements of the eyes. Head movements were observed in some sites but their amplitudes were very small (mean=2.4 degrees). The occurrence of head movements and their amplitude were not enhanced by increasing stimulation frequency or intensity. In several cases, electrically evoked gaze shifts exhibited an eye-head coupling that was different from that observed in visually triggered gaze shifts.

There are important issues concerning the stimulated brain target, with different nuclei currently under investigation. Our group asked in this pilot study whether Tourette syndrome could be treated by tailoring specific brain targets for specific symptoms. Deep brain stimulation for Tourette syndrome may thus in the future be tailored and patient specific, utilizing specific target regions for individual clinical manifestations. In our early experience we did not adequately address non-motor clinical symptoms as we only used a thalamic target. More recently in an obsessive compulsive disease cohort we have had success in using the anterior limb of the internal capsule and nucleus accumbens region as targets for stimulation. We therefore explored the option of a \"rescue\" procedure for our Tourette patients with persistent obsessive-compulsive disorder following ventralis oralis/centromedianus-parafascicularis (Vo/CM-Pf) deep brain stimulation. Following two cases where rescue anterior limb of internal capsule/nucleus accumbens leads were employed, we performed two additional procedures (anterior limb of the internal capsule plus ventralis oralis/centromedianus-parafascicularis and anterior limb of the internal capsule alone) with some mild improvement of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder, although the number of observations in this case series was low.

Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that ICSS caused a rapid induction of c-Fos expression in hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA) 3 and dentatus gyrus areas. Moreover, using microarray or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, we showed that ICSS modulates the expression of 62 hippocampal genes shortly after training. Most of the proteins encoded by these genes, such as calmodulin-dependent-phosphodiesterase 1 A (Pde1a), are part of signal transduction machineries or are related to anti-apoptosis, as heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (Hspa1a). Importantly, 10 of the regulated genes have been previously related with learning and memory or neural plasticity, including the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (Cart), adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (Adcyap1), serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (Sgk), Ret proto-oncogene (Ret), and Fos. The fact that the Fos gene was differentially expressed in our microarray experiments validated our findings from our immunohistochemical studies mentioned above.

Anesthesia was maintained with propofol, rocuronium and remifentanil in perfusion during the intervention, which was uneventful. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and sedation was provided with remifentanil to allow slow, gradual emergence from anesthesia. The patient was discharged from hospital after placement of the implanted pulse generator, and subsequent follow-up showed improvement of the dystonia.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "9", "title": "Post-stroke pain.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "6189561", "authors": ["Kim, JS"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Expert review of neurotherapeutics", "abstract": "Deep-brain stimulation has been used to treat advanced Parkinson disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders that have not responded to other treatments.

As the aging population continues to increase, CPSP will become an even more important problem in the future. Although the pathogenesis of CPSP is not yet known, it has been suggested that underlying causes include hyperexcitation in the damaged sensory pathways, damage to the central inhibitory pathways, or a combination of the two. Adrenergic antidepressants are currently the first-line drugs for CPSP, but their effect is frequently incomplete. Antiepileptics, such as lamotrigine, can be used as an adjunctive therapy, while GABAergic drugs, such as gabapentin or pregabalin, have recently emerged as a potentially useful therapy.

We showed previously that high-frequency (HF) NAC DBS suppressed pyramidal cell firing and enhanced slow local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) via antidromic activation of corticostriatal recurrent inhibition. Using simultaneous multisite LFP recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats, we now show that NAC DBS delivered for 90 min at high or low frequency (LF) selectively affects spontaneous and evoked LFP oscillatory power and coherence within and between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral OFC, mediodorsal thalamus (MD), and NAC. Compared with LF or sham DBS, HF DBS enhanced spontaneous slow oscillations and potentiated evoked LFP responses only in OFC. HF DBS also produced widespread increases in spontaneous beta and gamma power and enhanced coherent beta activity between MD and all other regions. In contrast, LF DBS elevated theta power in MD and NAC. Analysis of acute NAC-induced oscillations showed that HF DBS increased and LF DBS decreased induced relative gamma coherence compared with sham DBS. These data suggest that HF (therapeutic) and LF (possibly deleterious) NAC DBS produce distinct region-specific and frequency band-specific changes in LFP oscillations. NAC DBS may achieve therapeutic effects by enhancing rhythmicity and synchronous inhibition within and between afferent structures, thereby normalizing function of a neural circuit that shows aberrant activity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "In vivo electrical impedance spectroscopy of tissue reaction to microelectrode arrays.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "19427999", "authors": ["Sudhyadhom, A", "Haq, IU", "Foote, KD", "Okun, MS", "Bova, FJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "abstract": "Several investigators have described the efficacy and safety of unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Presently, many types of dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitors, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor or other antiparkinsonian drugs are being developed. However, it is still very difficult to medically treat motor complications associated with levodopa therapy. Surgical intervention using DBS was possible to stimulate the subthalamic nucleus as the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus improves the cardinal parkinsonian symptoms and motor complication associated with levodopa treatment. DBS is a reversible treatment and the original status could be observed by turning off the stimulation. This procedure enables the observation of clinical outcomes or brain mechanisms under both the conditions of turned on and turned off stimulations. On the other hand, dystonia is heterogeneous and refractory and hence, it has been difficult to medically treat it. Since there was no effective treatment available for patients with generalized dystonia, these patients became disabled. However, recently, bilateral pallidal DBS has been shown to markedly improve the conditions of patients with generalized dystonia, and it has proven to be a reliable treatment. There are two characteristic clinical effects of pallidal DBS on dystonia. It improves primary hereditary generalized dystonia, particularly DYT 1, more prominently than secondary dystonia and its beneficial effects are observed over a period of time course. The beneficial effects of pallidal DBS in patients with dystonia are not immediate but progress over weeks to months. The brain mechanism underlying the improvement of pallidal DBS in dystonia has been unclear. Many studies on DBS in Parkinson's disease and dystonia have been carried out to elucidate the clinical outcomes and/or the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. In this review, the clinical outcomes of DBS for Parkinson's disease and dystonia will be focused on.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Dystonic storm due to Batten's disease treated with pallidotomy and deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "11140768", "authors": ["Sako, W", "Nishio, M", "Maruo, T", "Shimazu, H", "Matsuzaki, K", "Tamura, T", "Mure, H", "Ushio, Y", "Nagahiro, S", "Kaji, R", "Goto, S"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Auditory brainstem responses provide diagnostic value in pathologies involving the early parts of the auditory pathway.

The evidence of the generator sites is therefore fragmented and indirect, based strongly on lesion studies and animal models. Source modeling of EEG has been limited to grand averages across multiple subjects. Here, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to shed more light on the neural origins of the auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and to test whether such deep brain structures are accessible by MEG. We show that the magnetic counterparts of the electric ABRs can be measured in 30 min and that they allow localization of some of the underlying neural sources in individual subjects. Many of the electric ABR components were present in our MEG data; however, the morphologies of the magnetic and electric responses were different, indicating that the MEG signals carry information complementary to the EEG data. The locations of the neural sources corresponding to the magnetic ABR deflections ranged from the auditory nerve to the inferior colliculus.

Even when identified, there is a common perception that many of these symptoms are untreatable. The role of dopaminergic drugs in treating the various non-motor problems of PD, although clinically recognised, has received little attention. In this Review, we investigate the dopaminergic basis of the range of non-motor symptoms that occur in PD such as depression, apathy, sleep disorders (including rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder), and erectile dysfunction.

Defining how activities in spatially distributed brain regions overtly synchronize in narrow frequency bands is critical for understanding disease processes like Parkinson's disease. To address this, we studied cortical responses to electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) at various frequencies between 5 and 30 Hz in two cohorts of eight patients with Parkinson's disease from two different surgical centres. We found that evoked activity consisted of a series of diminishing waves with a peak latency of 21 ms for the first wave in the series. The cortical evoked potentials (cEPs) averaged in each group were well fitted by a damped oscillator function (r > or = 0.9, P < 0.00001). Fits suggested that the natural frequency of the subthalamo-cortical circuit was around 20 Hz. When the system was forced at this frequency by stimulation of the STN at 20 Hz, the undamped amplitude of the modelled cortical response increased relative to that with 5 Hz stimulation in both groups (P < or = 0.005), consistent with resonance. Restoration of dopaminergic input by treatment with levodopa increased the damping of oscillatory activity (as measured by the modelled damping factor) in both patient groups (P < or = 0.001). The increased damping would tend to limit resonance, as confirmed in simulations. Our results show that the basal ganglia-cortical network involving the STN has a tendency to resonate at approximately 20 Hz in Parkinsonian patients. This resonance phenomenon may underlie the propagation and amplification of activities synchronized around this frequency. Crucially, dopamine acts to increase damping and thereby limit resonance in this basal ganglia-cortical network.", "pages": "1985; author reply 1985-6"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Anaesthesia and Parkinson's disease: how to manage with new therapies?", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15218068", "authors": ["Mayberg, HS"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Current opinion in anaesthesiology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely applied clinical procedure for the alleviation of pathological neural activity, and is particularly effective in suppressing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
