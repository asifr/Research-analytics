In this paper, a shared protocol for intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring arising from the meetings of a panel of neurophysiologists of the DBS Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society is proposed. Intraoperative monitoring is composed by microrecordings and functional stimulation. In microrecordings, it is recommended to use at least 2-3 electrodes, descending with steps of 0.5-1 mm and waiting at least 60 s before changing the position. Functional stimulation is used to assess the clinical efficacy and the side effects induced by STN-DBS at different positions. Based on the therapeutic window, an algorithm to find the optimal target is proposed. The procedures for intraoperative monitoring for STN-DBS proposed here are safe, relatively cheap, take approximately 30-40 min per side and could offer valuable additional information to the surgeon.", "pages": "449-57"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Effect of midazolam on memory: a study of process dissociation procedure and functional magnetic resonance imaging.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "20412150", "authors": ["Tian, SY", "Zou, L", "Quan, X", "Zhang, Y", "Xue, FS", "Ye, TH"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Anaesthesia", "abstract": "To assess the effects of midazolam on explicit and implicit memories, 12 volunteers were randomly divided into the two groups: one with an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of 3 (mild sedation) and one with a score of 1 (deep sedation). Blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging was measured before and during an auditory stimulus, then with midazolam sedation, and then during a second auditory stimulus with continuous midazolam sedation. After 4 h, explicit and implicit memories were assessed. There was no evidence of explicit memory at the two levels of midazolam sedation. Implicit memory was retained at a mild level of midazolam sedation but absent at a deep level of midazolam sedation. At a mild level of midazolam sedation, activation of all brain areas by auditory stimulus (as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging) was uninhibited. However, a deep level of midazolam sedation depressed activation of the superior temporal gyrus by auditory stimulus. We conclude that midazolam does not abolish implicit memory at a mild sedation level, but can abolish both explicit and implicit memories at a deep sedation level.

To control abnormal spontaneous electrical activity in target brain areas DBS utilizes a continuous stimulation signal. This continuous power draw means that its implanted battery power source needs to be replaced every 18-24 months. To prolong the life span of the battery, a technique to accurately recognize and predict the onset of the Parkinson's disease tremors in human subjects and thus implement an on-demand stimulator is discussed here. The approach is to use a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and principal component analysis (PCA) with Local Field Potential (LFP) data recorded via the stimulation electrodes to predict activity related to tremor onset. To test this approach, LFPs from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) obtained through deep brain electrodes implanted in a Parkinson patient are used to train the network. To validate the network's performance, electromyographic (EMG) signals from the patient's forearm are recorded in parallel with the LFPs to accurately determine occurrences of tremor, and these are compared to the performance of the network. It has been found that detection accuracies of up to 89% are possible. Performance comparisons have also been made between a conventional RBFNN and an RBFNN based on PSO which show a marginal decrease in performance but with notable reduction in computational overhead.", "pages": "449-57"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder--a case report.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "20405672", "authors": ["Csig\u00f3, K", "Dome, L", "Val\u00e1lik, I", "Hars\u00e1nyi, A", "Demeter, G", "Racsm\u00e1ny, M"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Ideggy\u00f3gy\u00e1szati szemle", "abstract": "In the past 30 years it has been a great development in the unders-anding and therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The earliest work performed with in vitro preparations established that DCN cells have the capacity to translate membrane hyperpolarizations into a rebound increase in firing frequency. The primary means of distinguishing between DCN neurons has been according to cell size and transmitter phenotype, but in some cases, differences in the firing properties of DCN cells maintained in vitro have been reported. In particular, it was shown that large diameter cells in the rat DCN exhibit two phenotypes of rebound discharge in vitro that may eventually help define their functional roles in cerebellar output. A transient burst and weak burst phenotype can be distinguished based on the frequency and pattern of rebound discharge immediately following a hyperpolarizing stimulus. Work to date indicates that the difference in excitability arises from at least the degree of activation of T-type Ca(2+) current during the immediate phase of rebound firing and Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels that underlie afterhyperpolarizations. Both phenotypes can be detected following stimulation of Purkinje cell inhibitory inputs under conditions that preserve resting membrane potential and natural ionic gradients.

In this study, rCBF changes induced by hippocampal DBS are evaluated by subtraction analysis of stimulation on/off using small animal microSPECT of the rat brain. Rats (n=13) were implanted with a multi-contact DBS electrode in the right hippocampus and injected with 10 mCi of HMPAO-Tc99(m) during application of various hippocampal DBS paradigms and amplitudes and during sham stimulation. Subtraction analysis revealed that hippocampal DBS caused a significant decrease in relative rCBF, both in the ipsi- (the side of the implanted electrode) and contralateral hippocampus. Hypoperfusion spread contralaterally with increasing stimulation amplitude. A clear distinction in spatial extent and intensity of hypoperfusion was observed between stimulation paradigms: bipolar Poisson Distributed Stimulation induced significant hypoperfusion ipsi- and contralaterally (p<0.01), while during other stimulation paradigms, rCBF-changes were less prominent. In conclusion, small animal microSPECT allows us to draw conclusions on the location, spatial extent and intensity of the hypoperfusion observed in the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus, induced by hippocampal DBS.

Virtually all studies comparing presurgical to postsurgical verbal fluency performance have detected a decrease with DBS. The decline may be attributable in part to the surgical procedures, yet the relative contributions of stimulation effects are not known. In the present study, we used patient-specific DBS computer models to investigate the effects of stimulation on verbal fluency performance. Specifically, we investigated relationships of the volume and locus of activated STN tissue to verbal fluency outcome. Stimulation of different electrode contacts within the STN did not affect total verbal fluency scores. However, models of activation revealed subtle relationships between the locus and volume of activated tissue and verbal fluency performance. At ventral contacts, more tissue activation inside the STN was associated with decreased letter fluency performance. At optimal contacts, more tissue activation within the STN was associated with improved letter fluency performance.

The unique feature of cluster headache is the distinctive circadian and circannual periodicity in the episodic forms. The attacks are stereotypic--they are of extreme intensity and short duration, occur unilaterally, and are associated with robust signs and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Although the pathophysiology of cluster headache remains to be fully understood, there have been a number of recent seminal observations. To exclude structural mimics, patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of cluster headache warrant at least a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in their work-up. The medical treatment of cluster headache includes acute, transitional, and maintenance prophylaxis. Agents used for acute therapy include inhalation of oxygen, triptans, such as sumatriptan, and dihydroergotamine. Transitional prophylaxis refers to the short-term use of fast-acting agents. This typically involves either corticosteroids or an occipital nerve block. The mainstay of prophylactic therapy is verapamil.

Nevertheless, levodopa treatment and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) have been shown to improve motor deficits and temporal estimation skills in such patients. So far, temporal estimation tasks in PD patients have evaluated the ability to reproduce intervals of time, but never the duration of an action. Here we investigated: (1) the ability of PD patients to reproduce the duration of their previous actions as compared to their ability to reproduce intervals of time and (2) the effect that DBS-STN has on both skills. Nineteen PD patients with DBS-STN and 19 controls were requested to reproduce the duration of an action and that of an interval of time. The patients were tested in the following treatment conditions: on stimulation/off medication, off stimulation/off medication and off stimulation/on medication. The results demonstrated that patients in the off stimulation/off medication condition under-reproduced the duration of their actions while accurately reproducing the duration of time intervals. The accuracy of the performance improved significantly in both treatment regimens.

STN electrical stimulation elicited a stimulus time-locked increase in striatal dopamine release that was both stimulus intensity- and frequency-dependent. Intensity-dependent (1-7V) increases in evoked dopamine release exhibited a sigmoidal pattern attaining a plateau between 5 and 7V of stimulation, while frequency-dependent dopamine release exhibited a linear increase from 60 to 120Hz and attained a plateau thereafter (120-240Hz). Unlike previous rodent models of STN DBS, optimal dopamine release in the striatum of the pig was obtained with stimulation frequencies that fell well within the therapeutically effective frequency range of human DBS (120-180Hz). These results highlight the critical importance of utilizing a large animal model that more closely represents implanted DBS electrode configurations and human neuroanatomy to study neurotransmission evoked by STN DBS.

We found a reliable NBR measured in rat somatosensory cortex in response to unilateral electrical whisker stimulation, which was located in deeper cortical layers relative to the positive BOLD response. Separate optical measurements (two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry) revealed that the NBR was a result of decreased blood volume and flow and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin. Neural activity in the NBR region, measured by multichannel electrodes, varied considerably as a function of cortical depth. There was a decrease in neuronal activity in deep cortical laminae. After cessation of whisker stimulation there was a large increase in neural activity above baseline. Both the decrease in neuronal activity and increase above baseline after stimulation cessation correlated well with the simultaneous measurement of blood flow suggesting that the NBR is related to decreases in neural activity in deep cortical layers.

We constructed a computational model of the subthalamopallidal network, trained it to fit in vivo recordings from parkinsonian monkeys, and evaluated its response to STN DBS. The network model was created with synaptically connected single compartment biophysical models of STN and pallidal neurons, and stochastically defined inputs driven by cortical beta rhythms. A least mean square error training algorithm was developed to parameterize network connections and minimize error when compared to experimental spike and burst rates in the parkinsonian condition. The output of the trained network was then compared to experimental data not used in the training process. We found that reducing the influence of the cortical beta input on the model generated activity that agreed well with recordings from normal monkeys. Further, during STN DBS in the parkinsonian condition the simulations reproduced the reduction in GPi bursting found in existing experimental data. The model also provided the opportunity to greatly expand analysis of GPi bursting activity, generating three major predictions. First, its reduction was proportional to the volume of STN activated by DBS. Second, GPi bursting decreased in a stimulation frequency dependent manner, saturating at values consistent with clinically therapeutic DBS. And third, ablating STN neurons, reported to generate similar therapeutic outcomes as STN DBS, also reduced GPi bursting. Our theoretical analysis of stimulation induced network activity suggests that regularization of GPi firing is dependent on the volume of STN tissue activated and a threshold level of burst reduction may be necessary for therapeutic effect.", "pages": "449-57"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Factors related to extended hospital stays following deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "4104275", "authors": ["Strowd, RE", "Cartwright, MS", "Passmore, LV", "Ellis, TL", "Tatter, SB", "Siddiqui, MS"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Intracranial neurostimulation for pain relief is most frequently delivered by stimulating the motor cortex, the sensory thalamus, or the periaqueductal and periventricular gray matter. The stimulation of these sites through MCS (motor cortex stimulation) and DBS (deep brain stimulation) has proven effective for treating a number of neuropathic and nociceptive pain states that are not responsive or amenable to other therapies or types of neurostimulation. Prospective randomized clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of these intracranial therapies have not been published. Intracranial neurostimulation is somewhat different than other forms of neurostimulation in that its current primary application is for the treatment of medically intractable movement disorders. However, the increasing use of intracranial neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic pain, especially for pain not responsive to other neuromodulation techniques, reflects the efficacy and relative safety of these intracranial procedures. First employed in 1954, intracranial neurostimulation represents one of the earliest uses of neurostimulation to treat chronic pain that is refractory to medical therapy. Currently, 2 kinds of intracranial neurostimulation are commonly used to control pain: motor cortex stimulation and deep brain stimulation. MCS has shown particular promise in the treatment of trigeminal neuropathic pain and central pain syndromes such as thalamic pain syndrome. DBS may be employed for a number of nociceptive and neuropathic pain states, including cluster headaches, chronic low back pain, failed back surgery syndrome, peripheral neuropathic pain, facial deafferentation pain, and pain that is secondary to brachial plexus avulsion. The unique lack of stimulation-induced perceptual experience with MCS makes MCS uniquely suited for blinded studies of its effectiveness.

Previous preclinical studies have demonstrated that STN-DBS can attenuate the degeneration of a relatively intact nigrostriatal system from dopamine (DA)-depleting neurotoxins. The present study examined whether STN-DBS can provide neuroprotection in the face of prior significant nigral DA neuron loss similar to PD patients at the time of diagnosis. STN-DBS between 2 and 4 weeks after intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) provided significant sparing of DA neurons in the SN of rats. This effect was not due to inadvertent lesioning of the STN and was dependent upon proper electrode placement.

This disease manifests as tremors that usually occur in the hands, but they may also be present in the head, face, tongue, and lower limbs. Radiofrequency thalamotomy (RF) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are common invasive procedures with proven track records that are used to treat ET. Although these procedures have high success rates, they still put patients at risk of potential side effects and are invasive by nature. Thalamotomy using the gamma knife (GK) also produces favorable outcomes in treating tremors, without the complications associated with invasive neurosurgery procedures. This report describes the presenting symptoms and extended treatment outcome for a patient with an advanced case of ET, who received GK thalamotomy treatment six years ago. Because of this non-invasive treatment, she regained the ability to paint and live with an improved quality of life. We also discuss and review the relevant literature regarding the risks and benefits of this treatment modality. GK thalamotomy is one effective option for the treatment of ET, and due to its noninvasive nature, it has a different risk profile than neurosurgery. We suggest that GK thalamotomy should be presented as one viable treatment option to all ET patients, and should be recommended to those who would be best served by less invasive treatment techniques.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Cognitive event-related potentials and oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus.", "issue": "", "pmid": "837228", "authors": ["Allert, N", "Kelm, D", "Blahak, C", "Capelle, HH", "Krauss, JK"], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of hypertension and its mode of progression are complex, multifactoral and incompletely understood. However, there is accumulating evidence from humans and animal models of hypertension indicating that excessive central sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) plays a pathogenic role in triggering and sustaining the essential hypertensive state (the so-called 'neuroadrenergic hypothesis'). Importantly, augmented central sympathetic outflow has also been implicated in the initiation and progression of a plethora of pathophysiological processes independent of any increase in blood pressure, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, the sympathetic nervous system constitutes an important putative drug target in hypertension. However, traditional pharmacological approaches for the management of essential hypertension appear ineffective in reducing central sympathetic outflow. Recently, several new and promising therapeutic strategies targeting neurogenic hypertension have been developed. The present report will provide a brief update of this topic with a particular emphasis on human studies examining the efficacy of novel pharmacological approaches (central sympatholytics and statins), lifestyle modification (aerobic exercise training, weight loss and stress reduction) and surgical intervention (renal denervation, chronic carotid baroreflex stimulation and deep brain stimulation) in reducing excessive central sympathetic activation in hypertension.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "Suicide attempts after subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "", "pmid": "837229", "authors": ["Shin, HW", "Chang, JW", "Kang, SY", "Sohn, YH"], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "The PINK1 type of young-onset Parkinson disease is characterized by variable combinations of rigidity, bradykinesia, and rest tremor, often making it clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson disease.
