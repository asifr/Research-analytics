The target has, however, varied substantially among different neurosurgeons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamus and posterior subthalamic area (PSA) in relation to electrode location. METHODS: 36 (17Vim / 19 PSA) patients, with 44 DBS electrodes, were included in this retrospective study. The effect of stimulation was evaluated with standardized settings for each contact using items from the essential tremor rating scale (ETRS). RESULTS: When each contact was evaluated regarding the treated hand with standardized stimulation, the electrode contact providing the best effect in the individual patient was in 54% located in the zona incerta (Zi) or radiation prelemniscalis (raprl) and in 12 % the Vim. 40 contacts provided a tremor reduction of >90%. Of these, 43% were located in the PSA and 18% in the Vim according to the Schaltenbrandt atlas. 37 of these 40 contacts were found in the PSA group. CONCLUSION: More contacts yielding an optimal effect were found in the PSA group than in the Vim. Many patients operated upon in the Vim got the best effect in a contact located in the PSA. This might suggest that the PSA is a more efficient target than the Vim.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Conceptual and ethical issues with brain-hardware interfaces.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "21934620", "authors": ["Clausen, J"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Current opinion in psychiatry", "abstract": "Progress in neurosciences, increasing computational power, and ongoing miniaturization of micro-technological components enable both a better understanding of human brain functions and development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Human cognitive operations take place in hierarchically structured neural organizations in the brain. The process of low-order neural representation of sensory stimuli becoming integrated in high-order cortices is also known as cognitive binding. Combining neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and anesthetic manipulation, we examined how cognitive networks involved in auditory verbal memory are maintained in wakefulness, disrupted in propofol-induced deep sedation, and re-established in recovery. Inspired by the notion of cognitive binding, an functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided connectivity analysis was utilized to assess the integrity of functional interactions within and between different levels of the task-defined brain regions. Task-related responses persisted in the primary auditory cortex (PAC), but vanished in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and premotor areas in deep sedation. For connectivity analysis, seed regions representing sensory and high-order processing of the memory task were identified in the PAC and IFG. Propofol disrupted connections from the PAC seed to the frontal regions and thalamus, but not the connections from the IFG seed to a set of widely distributed brain regions in the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes (with exception of the PAC). These later regions have been implicated in mediating verbal comprehension and memory. These results suggest that propofol disrupts cognition by blocking the projection of sensory information to high-order processing networks and thus preventing information integration. Such findings contribute to our understanding of anesthetic mechanisms as related to information and integration in the brain.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "7", "title": "Invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "14520655", "authors": ["Nguyen, JP", "Nizard, J", "Keravel, Y", "Lefaucheur, JP"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Nature reviews. Neurology", "abstract": "Distinct thalamic nuclei, like the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus and the centromedian/parafascicular complex (CM/Pf), are embedded in different basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops, which were shown to integrate cognitive and emotional aspects of human behavior. Despite well described connections on a microscopic scale, derived from tracing studies in animals, little is known about the intrinsic anatomical connections of these nuclei in humans. This lack of knowledge limits not only interpretation of functional imaging studies but also estimation of direct effects of deep brain stimulation which treats diseases as different as epilepsy or major depression. Therefore, non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies are key to analyzing connectivity patterns and elaborate approaches to close this gap. For our study, we explored the structural connectivity of the MD thalamic nuclei and the CM/Pf complex towards five cortical and six subcortical regions by using a preferential fiber calculation. We found both thalamic nuclei to be preferentially associated to distinct networks: whereas the MD is preferentially connected to prefrontal and limbic cortical regions, the CM is linked to subcortical regions. The anterior insula was the only cortical region associated with the subcortical network of the CM and the cortical network of the MD comprised one subcortical hub, the caudate nucleus, suggesting an integrative role of these two regions. Adding to predescribed anatomical tract tracing connectivities in animal studies, our finding lends support to the existence of similar basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in humans and we could show a robust distinction of preferential connectivity for both thalamic nuclei.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Deep brain stimulation in addiction: a review of potential brain targets.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "14688612", "authors": ["Luigjes, J", "van den Brink, W", "Feenstra, M", "van den Munckhof, P", "Schuurman, PR", "Schippers, R", "Mazaheri, A", "De Vries, TJ", "Denys, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "abstract": "Timing in the range of seconds referred to as interval timing is crucial for cognitive operations and conscious time processing. According to recent models of interval timing basal ganglia (BG) oscillatory loops are involved in time interval recognition. Parkinso\u0144s disease (PD) is a typical disease of the basal ganglia that shows distortions in interval timing. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a powerful treatment of PD which modulates motor and cognitive functions depending on stimulation frequency by affecting subcortical-cortical oscillatory loops. Thus, for the understanding of BG-involvement in interval timing it is of interest whether STN-DBS can modulate timing in a frequency dependent manner by interference with oscillatory time recognition processes. We examined production and reproduction of 5 and 15 second intervals and millisecond timing in a double blind, randomised, within-subject repeated-measures design of 12 PD-patients applying no, 10-Hz- and \u2265 130-Hz-STN-DBS compared to healthy controls.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise as a treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain and phantom limb pain. Compared with DBS, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is currently more frequently used, mainly because it is more easily performed, and has a wider range of indications (including central poststroke pain). Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MCS in the treatment of various types of neuropathic pain, although these trials included a limited number of patients and need to be confirmed by large, controlled, multicenter studies.

Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes.

This notion is exemplified by observations that gait is disturbed by most diseases that affect the BG. However, it is unclear in what way the BG are activated during gait. One method to investigate the activity of the BG is to record local field potentials (LFPs) from electrodes placed in the BG for therapeutic purposes. Nowadays, the globus pallidus internum (GPi) represents the target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in dystonia. LFPs recorded from this area have been shown to delineate activity associated with dystonic cramps but also activity that may be relevant for certain types of movement. In this study we recorded LFPs from DBS electrodes implanted into the GPi of eight patients with dystonia during walking on a treadmill machine and compared these data with data acquired during rest (sitting and standing). There was no difference in the power of frequency bands during the sitting and standing conditions. LFP power in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and gamma (60-90 Hz) frequency bands was higher during walking than during the resting conditions. Beta (15-25 Hz) frequencies were the only frequencies that were down-regulated during walking. The amplitude of the theta and alpha frequency bands was modulated during the gait cycle.

HFS decreased neuronal firing rates in rats with CCI up to ~50% except for spontaneous activity, whereas low-frequency stimulation had no effect. Compared to naive rats, burst firing properties (burst events, percentage of spikes in burst, and mean interburst time) were altered in rats with CCI, whereas these changes were reversed to near normal after HFS.

However, methods for long-term, stable recording of multiple single-units in deep brain regions and in dura-surrounded ganglion have not yet been established. In the present study, we propose a bundled microwire array design which is capable of long-term recording of the trigeminal ganglion and deep-brain units. This electrode set is easy to construct from common materials and tools found in an electrophysiological laboratory. The salient features of our design include: (1) short and separated tungsten microwires for stable chronic recording; (2) the use of a 30-guage stainless steel guide tube for facilitating penetration and aiming for deep targets as well as electrical grounding; (3) the inclusion of a reference of the same microwire material inside the bundle to enhance common mode rejection of far field noises; and (4) an adjustable connector. In our case, we used a 90\u00b0 backward bending connector so that implanted rats could perform the same hole-seeking behavior and their faces and the whiskers could be stimulated in the behaving state. It was demonstrated that this multi-channel electrode caused minimal tissue damage at the recording site and we were able to obtain good, stable single-unit recordings from the trigeminal ganglion and ventroposterior medial thalamus areas of freely moving rats for up to 80 days. This methodology is useful for the studies that require long term and high quality unit recording in the deep brain or in the trigeminal system.", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "68", "title": "Effect of pallidal deep brain stimulation on psychiatric symptoms in myoclonus-dystonia due to \u03b5-sarcoglycan mutations.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "22672380", "authors": [], "year": "2011", "journal": "Archives of neurology", "abstract": "This paper briefly describes how the electrical stimulation, used since antiquity to modulate the nervous system, has been a fundamental tool of neurophysiologic investigation in the second half of the eighteenth century and was subsequently used by the early twentieth century, even for therapeutic purposes. In mid-twentieth century the advent of stereotactic procedures has allowed the drift from lesional to stimulating technique of deep nuclei of the brain for therapeutic purposes. In this way, deep brain stimulation (DBS) was born, that, over the last two decades, has led to positive results for the treatment of medically refractory Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. In recent years, the indications for therapeutic use of DBS have been extended to epilepsy, Tourette's syndrome, psychiatric diseases (depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), some kinds of headache, eating disorders, and the minimally conscious state. The potentials of the DBS for therapeutic use are fascinating, but there are still many unresolved technical and ethical problems, concerning the identification of the targets for each disease, the selection of the patients and the evaluation of the results.", "pages": ""}]
