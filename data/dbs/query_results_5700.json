Sleep may also be affected by dopaminergic and anticholinergic drugs or coexisting depressive syndrome. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus (STN) effectively reduces PD motor disability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sleep architecture modifications after STN DBS. We assessed five patients (two men and three women, mean age 63.8+/-3.3 years, with a mean history of PD of 13.8+/-4.9 years) who underwent STN DBS. The mean levodopa equivalent dosage (LED) was 1010+/-318 mg before surgery and 116+/-93 mg 3 months after surgery. Polysomnography (PSG) with audiovisual recordings was performed on two separate nights, the first assessment in the week before surgery and the second 3 months after surgery. Three months after surgery, PSG showed an increase in total sleep time, in the longest period of uninterrupted sleep, and in the percentage of stage 3-4 NREM sleep, while there was a reduction of wakefulness after sleep onset. PLM, apnea-hyopnea index and REM sleep behaviour disorder were unaffected by STN DBS. STN DBS seems to be an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease because it improves the cardinal symptoms and also seems to improve sleep architecture.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Electrical stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for the treatment of intractable epilepsy.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "15030497", "authors": ["Kerrigan, JF", "Litt, B", "Fisher, RS", "Cranstoun, S", "French, JA", "Blum, DE", "Dichter, M", "Shetter, A", "Baltuch, G", "Jaggi, J", "Krone, S", "Brodie, M", "Rise, M", "Graves, N"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Epilepsia", "abstract": "Animal studies and sporadic case reports in human subjects have suggested that intermittent electrical stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus reduces seizure activity.

Because the extent of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation can be quantified in PD even at an early or preclinical stage of the disease, PET imaging may allow the selection of at-risk subjects for neuroprotective intervention trials. These techniques may also provide markers to follow progression of disease or evaluate the effects of neurorestorative interventions in patients who have more advanced disease. PET is expected to play an increasing role in the selection of patients who have PD for deep brain stimulation. Dopaminergic studies may have a limited clinical role in the diagnosis of patients who have symptoms that suggestive of PD yet do not respond to typical dopaminergic drugs, such as patients who have vascular parkinsonism or ET with mild resting tremor who may have normal dopaminergic innervation. The differential diagnosis between PD and multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration is not yet clearly established by PET, but combined pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic imaging may be able to distinguish early idiopathic PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders, in general. Huntington's chorea is characterized by more prominent striatal dopamine receptor loss, whereas nigrostriatal denervation is present to a lesser degree. Patients who have TS may have enhanced synaptic dopamine release in the putamen. Functional imaging studies have generally failed to demonstrate nigrostriatal denervation in essential tremor or idiopathic dystonia. Studies have shown striatal dopamine receptor loss in selected subtypes of dystonic patients. In conclusion, it is expected that PET will help us to better understand the pathophysiology of movement disorders, increase the diagnostic accuracy, allow preclinical diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic agents. Pharmacologic radioligand displacement studies and the development of new nondopaminergic ligands may further aid in the unraveling of cerebral mechanisms that underlie movement disorders.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "10", "title": "Deep-brain stimulation extends relief from Parkinson's.

A new approach to investigate this interaction in man is combining acoustic stimulation activating the startle system with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex. However, it is unclear whether the inhibition of TMS responses following acoustic stimulation occurs at the level of the motor cortex through reticulo-cortical projections or subcortically, perhaps through reticulo-spinal projections. We compared the influence of acoustic stimulation on motor effects elicited by TMS over motor cortical areas to those evoked with subcortical electrical stimulation (SES) through depth electrodes in five patients treated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. SES bypasses the motor cortex, demonstrating any interaction with acoustic stimuli at the subcortical level. EMG was recorded from the contralateral biceps brachii muscle. Acoustic stimulation was delivered binaurally through headphones and used as a conditioning stimulus at an interstimulus interval of 50 ms. When TMS was used as the test stimulus, the area and amplitude of the conditioned motor response was significantly inhibited (area: 57.5+/-12.9%, amplitude: 47.9+/-7.4%, as percentage of unconditioned response) whereas facilitation occurred with SES (area: 110.1+/-4.3%, amplitude: 116.9+/-6.9%).

At a physiological level, the existence of bimodal cells is well documented and it is known that correlated audiovisual input enhances localisation and orienting behaviours. Audiovisual perceptual interactions have also been demonstrated (e.g., the well-known McGurk effect). The present study explores motion perception and asks whether correlated audiovisual motion signals would be better detected than unimodal motions or bimodal motions in opposing directions. Using a dynamic random-dot field with variable motion coherence as a visual stimulus, together with an auditory motion defined by a stereo noise source smoothly translating along a horizontal trajectory, we find that correlated bimodal motion yields only a slight improvement (approximately a square root of two advantage) in detection threshold relative to unimodal detection. The size of this benefit is consistent with a statistical advantage rather than a bimodal facilitation account. Moreover, anticorrelated bimodal motion showed the same modest improvement, again speaking against linear summation but consistent with statistical combination of visual and auditory signals. These findings were replicated in peripheral as well as in central vision, and with translating visual objects as well as with spatially distributed visual motion.

Emergent properties are network characteristics that are not predictably based on properties of individual member neurons. Neuronal membership within networks is controlled by several mechanisms, including burst firing, gap junctions, endogenous and exogenous neuroactive substances, extracellular ions, temperature, interneuron activity, astrocytic integration and external stimuli. The effects of many CNS drugs in vivo may critically involve actions on specific brain loci, but this selectivity may be absent when the same neurons are isolated from the network in vitro where emergent properties are lost. Audiogenic seizures (AGS) qualify as an emergent CNS property, since in AGS the acoustic stimulus evokes a non-linear output (motor convulsion), but the identical stimulus evokes minimal behavioral changes normally. The hierarchical neuronal network, subserving AGS in rodents is initiated in inferior colliculus (IC) and progresses to deep layers of superior colliculus (DLSC), pontine reticular formation (PRF) and periaqueductal gray (PAG) in genetic and ethanol withdrawal-induced AGS. In blocking AGS, certain anticonvulsants reduce IC neuronal firing, while other agents act primarily on neurons in other AGS network sites. However, the NMDA receptor channel blocker, MK-801, does not depress neuronal firing in any network site despite potently blocking AGS. Recent findings indicate that MK-801 actually enhances firing in substantia nigra reticulata (SNR) neurons in vivo but not in vitro. Thus, the MK-801-induced firing increases in SNR neurons observed in vivo may involve an indirect effect via disinhibition, involving an action on the emergent properties of this seizure network.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Parkinson's disease patients with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation gain weight.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15293291", "authors": ["Macia, F", "Perlemoine, C", "Coman, I", "Guehl, D", "Burbaud, P", "Cuny, E", "Gin, H", "Rigalleau, V", "Tison, F"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Despite the risk of postoperative visual field defect following surgery within the temporo-parieto-occipital region, visual mapping has rarely been described, in particular at the subcortical level.

Results suggested that the selected measures were sensitive to Parkinsonian postural sway abnormalities and highlight differences in response to treatments.

To date the precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Better insight in the mechanism of action may identify seizure types or syndromes that respond to such a treatment and may guide the search for optimal stimulation parameters and finally improve clinical efficacy. In the past ten years some progress has been made through neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, neurochemical and cerebral blood flow studies in patients and animals undergoing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Interesting results have been found in VNS-treated patients that underwent evoked potential measurements, cerebrospinal fluid investigation, neuropsychological testing and PET, SPECT and fMRI testing. Desynchronisation of abnormal synchronous epileptic activity is one of the hypotheses on the mode of action that might primarily be responsible for an anti-seizure effect. There is however increasing evidence from research and clinical observation that VNS might establish a true and long-term anti-epileptic effect. It has been shown that VNS influences neurotransmission in the brain and provokes long-term changes in cerebral blood flow in areas crucial for epileptogenesis such as the thalamus and medial temporal lobe structures. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for epilepsy has regained interest. Central nervous system structures known to play a key role in the epileptogenic network such as the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus have been targeted. Another approach is to target the ictal onset zone such as the medial temporal lobe. At Ghent University Hospital 10 patients have been treated with long-term amygdalohippocampal DBS. Several hypotheses have been raised for the mechanism of action of DBS for refractory seizures. Seizure reduction may be due to a microlesion caused by electrode insertion or by provoking a reversible functional lesion due to the effect of electrical current on hyperexcitable tissue. Neurophysiological techniques such as evoked potentials monitoring and intraoperative single unit potential recordings may guide correct electrode placement, individual DBS titration and elucidation of the mechanims of action of DBS for epilepsy.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Stereotactic biopsy for multifocal, diffuse, and deep-seated brain tumors using Leksell's system.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "14978676", "authors": ["Yamada, K", "Goto, S", "Kochi, M", "Ushio, Y"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "Human postural control of upright stance sporadically can show an oscillatory behavior.

We found abnormal 1 Hz body sway oscillation in the SDA curves of PD patients that differed significantly from the body sway typically observed in control subjects during quiet stance. The 1 Hz body sway oscillation was associated with abnormally large and fast sway in the patients off treatment. Under treatment with levodopa, with 'deep brain stimulation' (subthalamic nucleus) and even more so with combined treatment, the oscillations in the SDA curves vanished and the sway became slower. The loss of oscillation and reduction of sway velocity were highly correlated with the improvements of patients' clinical motor assessment score. However, sway amplitude was not correlated with the patients' motor assessment score and patients reported clinical improvement under therapy even though sway amplitude increased on average. A simple feedback model of the postural control system with abnormally large internal noise could predict experimental measures both on and off treatment.

Hyperactivity of STN as a consequence of the loss of dopaminergic inputs to the BG is believed to be a major factor in producing the motor symptoms of PD. High-frequency (HF) deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN has recently become an important treatment in PD patients where medications no longer provide satisfactory therapy. However, the mechanisms underlying DBS therapy are unknown, and there is seemingly conflicting data suggesting inhibition or excitation of STN neurons. This study directly examined the effects of stimulation in STN on the activity of STN neurons in PD patients during functional stereotactic mapping prior to insertion of DBS electrodes. Electrical stimulation in STN was investigated in twelve PD patients by recording the neural activity of a cell in STN with one electrode while applying current pulses through a second electrode located about 600 microm away. Stimulation at high frequencies (100-300 Hz) was found to produce inhibition following the stimulus train in 42% of the 60 cells tested. Inhibition during the train was seen in 13 of 15 neurons where it was possible to detect such activity. Furthermore, in 44% of the cases where HF stimulation produced inhibition there was an early inhibition followed by rebound excitation and a further inhibitory period, suggesting that the inhibitions observed are due to hyperpolarization. In eight of the 25 neurons inhibited by HF stimulation, the effects of single stimuli were determined and revealed that in seven of these there was an inhibitory period of 15-20 ms following each stimulus. Thus, the present findings suggest that local HF stimulation inhibits many STN neurons. However, these studies could not determine whether the stimulus also directly excited the cell and/or its axon, but other recent findings suggest that this is likely the case. Therefore, the overall effects of DBS stimulation in STN are likely to be inhibition of intrinsic and synaptically mediated activity, and its replacement by regular high-frequency firing.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Surgery in Tourette syndrome.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "14745096", "authors": ["Temel, Y", "Visser-Vandewalle, V"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Though intraoperative neurophysiology is essential to precisely define the definitive target, little is known regarding its predictive value in defining the most effective contact for chronic deep brain stimulation.

In contrast to the task we used previously, the new version required the monkey to dissociate perceptual judgments from preparation to execute specific operant saccades. The monkey discriminated between 2 opposed directions of motion in a random-dot motion stimulus and was required to maintain the decision in memory throughout a delay period before the target of the required operant saccade was revealed. We hypothesized that perceptual decisions made in this paradigm would be represented in an \"abstract\" or \"categorical\" form within the brain, probably in the frontal cortex, and that decision-related neural activity would be eliminated from spatially organized preoculomotor structures such as the SC. To our surprise, however, a small population of neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC fired in a choice-specific manner early in the trial well before the monkey could plan the operant saccade. Furthermore, the representation of the decision during the delay period appeared to be spatial: the active region in the SC map corresponded to the region of space toward which the perceptually discriminated stimulus motion flowed. Electrical microstimulation experiments suggested that these decision-related SC signals were not merely related to covert saccade planning. We conclude that monkeys may employ, in part, a spatially referenced mnemonic strategy for representing perceptual decisions, even when an abstract, categorical representation might appear more likely a priori.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "99", "title": "Surgery for Parkinson disease in the United States, 1996 to 2000: practice patterns, short-term outcomes, and hospital charges in a nationwide sample.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "11839597", "authors": ["Eskandar, EN", "Flaherty, A", "Cosgrove, GR", "Shinobu, LA", "Barker, FG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Detrusor hyperreflexia is a relevant clinical symptom for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.

Because recent functional studies suggested that a hyperactivity of the posterior hypothalamus might be the primary cause of Cluster Headaches (CH) bouts, we designed a prospective study to explore the therapeutic effectiveness of chronic high-frequency stimulation of this region for the treatment of CH. Nine electrodes were stereotactically implanted in the posterior hypothalamus in eight patients suffering from intractable chronic CH. The stereotactic coordinates of the targeted area were 3\u00a0mm behind the mid-commissural point, 5\u00a0mm below the mid-commissural point, and 2\u00a0mm lateral from the midline. Since initiating this treatment in our center, all of the eight patients have improved. Steroid administration has been progressively withdrawn. All of the patients reported that they were pain-free at 1-26\u00a0months of follow-up. Three of the eight patients were pain-free without any medication while five of the eight required low doses of methysergide and/or verapamil. No noxious side effects from chronic high-frequency hypothalamic stimulation have been observed nor have we encountered any acute complications from the implant procedure. Tolerance was not observed. We conclude that these preliminary results indicate that hypothalamic stimulation is safe and effective for the treatment of drug-resistant, chronic CH. In addition, these data confirm the \"central\" pathogenesis for chronic CH.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "24", "title": "Six years' experience in deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: advantages and limitations of use of neurophysiological intraoperative microreading.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "12407177", "authors": ["Nordera, GP", "Mesiano, T", "Durisotti, C", "Bartolomei, L", "Piacentino, M", "Colombo, F", "Toso, V"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Acute pathologic neurologic laughter has been described as an ictal phenomenon in epilepsy, as a result of electrical brain stimulation to the cortex and to deep brain structures, in brain tumors, and in stroke.

Previously diagnosed with medically refractory complex partial seizures, our patient was admitted to the hospital with phenytoin toxicity. During video-EEG monitoring she experienced multiple brief absence seizures as well as a prolonged episode of absence status epilepticus. Immediately following cessation of the seizure she began to laugh. Her laughter was mirthful and infectious. This lasted several minutes and was followed immediately by several minutes of crying and then a return to normal. We propose that diffuse cortical inhibition led to release of subcortical structures involved in emotional expression.

Separate scans were run during deep (natural vs. man-made decision) and shallow (color vs. black-and-white decision) encoding and during old/new recognition of pictures initially presented in one of the two encoding conditions. A baseline condition consisting of a scrambled, color photograph was used as a contrast in each scan. Recognition accuracy was greater for the pictures on which semantic decisions were made at encoding, consistent with the expected levels of processing effect. A mixed-effects model was used to compare fMRI differences between conditions (deep-baseline vs. shallow-baseline) in both encoding and retrieval. For encoding, this contrast revealed greater activation associated with deep encoding in several areas, including the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), left middle temporal gyrus, and left anterior thalamus. Increased left hippocampal, right dorsolateral, and inferior frontal activations were found for recognition of items that had been presented in the deep relative to the shallow encoding condition. We speculate that the modulation of activity in these regions by the depth of processing manipulation shows that these regions support effective encoding and successful retrieval. A direct comparison between encoding and retrieval revealed greater activation during retrieval in the medial temporal (right hippocampus and bilateral PHG), anterior cingulate, and bilateral prefrontal (inferior and dorsolateral). Most notably, greater right posterior PHG was found during encoding compared to recognition. Focusing on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) region, our results suggest a greater involvement of both anterior MTL and prefrontal regions in retrieval compared to encoding.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "37", "title": "[Current therapies for parkinson's disease.

Because the STN has been shown to represent an important relay station not only in motor basal ganglia circuits, the modification of brain areas also involved in non-motor functioning can be expected by this intervention. To determine the impact of STN-DBS upon the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlc), we performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in eight patients with advanced PD before surgery as well as in the DBS on- and off-conditions 4 months after electrode implantation and in ten age-matched healthy controls. Before surgery, PD patients showed widespread bilateral reductions of cortical rCMRGlc versus controls but a hypermetabolic state in the left rostral cerebellum. In the STN-DBS on-condition, clusters of significantly increased rCMRGlc were found in both lower thalami reaching down to the midbrain area and remote from the stimulation site in the right frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and parietal cortex, whereas rCMRGlc significantly decreased in the left rostral cerebellum. Therefore, STN-DBS was found to suppress cerebellar hypermetabolism and to partly restore physiologic glucose consumption in limbic and associative projection territories of the basal ganglia. These data suggest an activating effect of DBS upon its target structures and confirm a central role of the STN in motor as well as associative, limbic, and cerebellar basal ganglia circuits.", "pages": "207-10"}, {"volume": "3", "title": "Complications and adverse effects of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's patients.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "12655065", "authors": ["Guehl, D", "Tison, F", "Cuny, E", "Benazzouz, A", "Rougier, A", "Bioulac, B", "Burbaud, P"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Expert review of neurotherapeutics", "abstract": "Measurements of the chronaxies and refractory periods with extracellular stimuli have been used to conclude that large diameter axons are responsible for the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS).

Computer simulation was used to determine the sensitivity of chronaxie and refractory period to the neural element stimulated. The results demonstrate that chronaxies and refractory periods were dependent on the polarity of the extracellular stimulus and the electrode-to-neuron distance, and indicate that there is little systematic difference in either chronaxies or refractory periods between local cells or axons of passage with extracellular stimulation.
