Because the conversion of a bilaterally evoked response to a unilaterally evoked one appears anesthesia-dependent, we hypothesized that central facilitation is an essential component of a bilateral adductor reflex and that its disturbance could result in weakened sphincteric closure. Six adult 50 kg pigs were used in this study. During electrical stimulation of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (iSLN) using bipolar platinum-iridium electrodes, the force of the evoked glottic closure response was measured using a pressure transducer positioned between both vocal cords, while electromyographic evoked response was recorded from both thyroarytenoid muscles under varying levels [0.5-1.0 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC)] of isoflurane anesthesia. The force of glottic closure appeared less under deep anesthesia, even with bilateral stimulation of the iSLN, than under light anesthesia with unilateral stimulation. As anesthetic levels approached 1.0 MAC, the glottic closing force decreased to 52-72% of the force measured under 0.5 MAC light anesthesia. Although it is generally understood that alteration of central facilitation by deepening anesthesia abolishes the crossed adductor reflex, the biomechanical effects of altered central facilitation on force differentials have never been previously demonstrated.

This freezing phenomenon which induces falls sometimes constitutes an initial sign. Like the gait initiation failure, freezing can be controlled by sensory stimulation, notably visual inputs, but also by more sustained attention. FALLS ARE MAINLY CONNECTED WITH BOTH POSTURAL INSTABILITY AND RIGIDITY: They are poorly influenced by dopaminergic therapies. The progressive decrease of step width represents a main factor in their occurrence. PRECOCITY OF GAIT DISORDERS IS UNUSUAL IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE: Other parkinsonian syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy and vascular parkinsonian syndrome must then be evoked. Their association with a cognitive impairment and abnormal sphincter behaviour infers a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus. GAIT IMPROVES WITH L-DOPA THERAPY: Speed, step length and duration of the swing phase are increased without change of cadence. Progressive loss of L-dopa efficiency on gait and postural stability contrasts with the persistent effect on tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia; a functional abnormality of nondopaminergic systems can explain these symptoms. In the following stages, gait troubles increased by motor fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements are less controlled by L-dopa therapy. PHYSICAL THERAPY PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN THERAPEUTIC MANAGEMENT: An individual or collective rehabilitation project must be established according to the stage of evolution; the exercises aim to protect postural control and coordination. Visual or sound rhythmic inputs can be employed in the case of gait initiation failure. THE EFFECTS OF FUNCTIONAL NEUROSURGERY ARE IN THE COURSE OF EVALUATION: Thermolesion and chronic electrical stimulation of deep brain structures have opposite effects on gait troubles. Bilateral thalamotomy or pallidotomy are sometimes a source of disequilibrium. Chronic thalamic stimulation does not induce either benefits or adverse effects. On the other hand, stimulation of the internal pallidum improves gait kinematic parameters; improved postural adjustments have also been reported.

Finally, the scientific evidence has shown good outcomes of neurostimulation methods for chronic neuropathic pain control. Recent research efforts have revealed new potential mechanisms of action of neurostimulation. Whereas its action was widely explained by gate control theory in the past, it seems that neuromodulation acts also by modulation of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Three neurostimulation methods are currently used in clinical practice: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The SCS and PNS are excellent treatment choices for certain forms of neuropathic pain. The new indications for SCS are end-stage peripheral vascular disease and ischemic heart disease, whereas PNS is used for the treatment of occipital neuralgia and chronic pelvic pain.

Significant correlations were evident between the improvement in motor performance and the regional cerebral blood flow changes mediated by stimulation.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become the preferred target in the past few years since our group demonstrated that high-frequency stimulation in this nucleus improves all cardinal features of PD, including resting tremor. This benefit in the parkinsonian symptoms allows a drastic reduction in daily levodopa requirements. Dyskinesias become drastically attenuated, possibly as a consequence of reduced dopaminergic medication but also because STN DBS may stabilize basal ganglia output activity, thus avoiding the problems associated with standard levodopa replacement therapy. DBS of the STN is associated with a marked improvement of motor function even in patients with advanced PD. Such a large degree of benefit in parkinsonian features relies on two crucial points that must be taken into consideration for achieving the best possible results with this technique: proper selection of patients and accuracy in targeting the STN. From a neurosurgical point of view, we believe that the most precise localization of the STN is obtained by using ventriculography to determine the stereotactic coordinates of the STN.

From the single dipole model, the equivalent current dipole (ECD) following the helix stimulation was estimated to be near the neck area of SI in all the subjects. In the lobulus stimulation, the ECDs were estimated around the neck area of SI in four subjects, in the face area in one subject, and in the deep white matter in two subjects. In the tragus stimulation, the ECDs were estimated around the neck area of SI in three subjects, in the hand area of SI in two subjects, and in the deep white matter in two subjects.

Because of this strategic position, subicular cells can modulate output of the hippocampus and, thus, play a significant part in memory, spatial processing, and seizure amplification and propagation from the hippocampus. Despite its important role as a hippocampal interface with different brain regions, present knowledge of the subiculum and the plastic properties of the synapses on the subicular neurons is rather limited. By using IR-DIC videomicroscopy and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse hippocampal slices, I demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1-subicular cell synapses can be readily induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the afferents, but not by pairing of low-frequency stimulation with depolarization of postsynaptic cells. This tetanus-induced LTP is input specific, insensitive to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 3-[(R)-2Carboxipiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (R-CPP), and reduces paired-pulse facilitation in potentiated synapses. Subsequent morphologic analysis of the recorded cells, which were filled either with Lucifer Yellow or Biocytin, revealed pyramidal-shaped neurons localized predominantly in the deep layer of the subiculum, close to the CA1 border. Axons of the majority of these neurons extended to the alveus and on toward the hippocampus, probably exiting it via the fornix. These data indicate that CA1-subicular cell synapses in mice exhibit LTP, which can be expressed presynaptically, and its induction does not require NMDA-receptor activation.

Antidromically conducted responses produced in single muscle afferents by stimulation at these two spinal levels were recorded from fine lateral gastrocnemius nerve filaments. In all fibers examined, stimulation of one branch, with strengths producing action potentials, increased the intraspinal threshold of the other branch when applied at short conditioning testing stimulus intervals (<1.5-2.0 ms), because of the refractoriness produced by the action potentials invading the tested branch. Similar increases in the intraspinal threshold were found in branches showing tonic PAD and also during the PAD evoked by stimulation of group I afferent fibers in muscle nerves. It is concluded that during tonic or evoked PAD, axonal branches in the dorsal columns and myelinated terminals of muscle afferents ending deep in the L6 and L3 segmental levels continue to be invaded by action potentials.

During the initial acquisition (720 trials), the groups did not differ with regard to their rate of learning or their overall level of responding.

Its mean value was 64.6+/-25.4 micros (SD) for the thalamic nucleus and 75.3+/-25.5 micros for the internal pallidum. Corrections to the mean values were made because the tau(sd) values were based on voltage-duration measurements using polarizable electrodes.

Although treatment of these problems has improved with the emergence of numerous pharmacologic and surgical therapies, the various options can make it confusing. Pharmacologic treatment is the first step. Polytherapy is often the rule in this case with a variety of agents available as adjunctive therapy with levodopa. These adjuncts include dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (tolcapone), controlled-release formulations of levodopa, monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors (selegiline), and amantadine. The treatment can consist of any of a number of combinations of these agents. No single algorithm can be used in all patients; therapy should be individualized. Physicians treating these patients need to be well versed in late complication patterns as well as the medications chosen. In addition, optimal doses vary, and often patients are considered treatment failures and taken off medications before reaching that level. In the more complicated cases, patients should be evaluated by specialists in movement disorders. With this in mind, some guidelines are offered for the pharmacologic approach to patients with fluctuating responses to medications. For simple wearing off, controlled-release levodopa (Sinemet CR, Dupont Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE), COMT inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, and dopamine agonists are reasonable options. For more complicated fluctuations, dopamine agonists with limits on levodopa are the first choice, especially when dyskinesia is present; when dyskinesia is not a factor, COMT inhibitors may be used. For dyskinesia specifically, dopamine agonists or addition of amantadine can be helpful. Surgery should be a treatment of last resort for patients in whom medical therapy fails. Patients who are candidates for medial pallidotomy should be fluctuators with severe dyskinesia and \"off\" periods that have not improved with pharmacologic therapy. Thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) should be used only in patients with tremor-predominant disease and severe intractable tremor that is unresponsive to medication and occurs not only at rest but with posture and action as well.

The main benefit of botulinum toxin injection is for head tremor, whereas its efficacy in hand tremor is variable.

The advantages of DBS in either the subthalamic nuclei (STN) or the internal part of the globus pallidus are that implantation of leads into these nuclei can be performed bilaterally, and that DBS is a reversible treatment. Pallidotomy and thalamotomy are permanent lesions and if performed bilaterally these lesions often cause unacceptable complications.

The stimulation sites include the thalamic nucleus ventralis intermedius(Vim), globus pallidus internus(GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The clinical data of DBS therapy currently available from the literature, together with our own experience, are reviewed. The results of our double blinded evaluation of the effects of GPi and STN stimulation are also summarized. DBS therapy affords the best effect on tremor when the Vim is selected as the stimulation site. DBS therapy is also useful for controlling rigidity when the GPi or STN is stimulated. Improvement of bradykinesia may often be induced by DBS therapy involving the GPi or STN. Dopa-induced dyskinesia can be attenuated effectively by the direct and/or indirect effects of DBS therapy. Two advantages of GPi and STN stimulation were identified in our double blinded evaluation. Firstly, the stimulation can supplement a reduced action of levodopa during the off-period. It thus improves the patient's daily activities through attenuation of the motor fluctuations. Secondly, the stimulation can replace part of the action of levodopa during the on-period. It thus attenuates dopa-induced dyskinesia through a reduced dose of medication. More importantly, the stimulation improves the daily activities in dopa-intolerant patients who are being administered a small dose of levodopa because of unbearable side effects. In addition, GPi stimulation has its own inhibitory effect on dopa-induced dyskinesia.", "pages": "310-4"}, {"volume": "12", "title": "Brain activation during reading in deep dyslexia: an MEG study.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "11068457", "authors": ["Laine, M", "Salmelin, R", "Helenius, P", "Marttila, R"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "abstract": "Modern neuronavigation systems lack spatial accuracy during ongoing surgical procedures because of increasing brain deformation, known as brain shift.

A total of 1050 units were isolated from five hemispheres of four animals. Receptive fields (RFs) and submodalities were identified for 90% of isolated neurons in areas 3a and 3b. The percentage decreased as the recoding site moved to the more caudal areas. Deep or skin submodality neurons were dominant in area 3a or area 3b, respectively. Deep submodality neurons increased in more caudal areas and were the majority in areas 2 and 5. These observations were consistent with those in the hand and/or digit or arm and/or trunk region. The identified neurons were classified by their RF positions into four types: the foot, leg, foot and leg, or hindlimb and other body parts type. Among 831 identified neurons, 33 neurons had bilateral RFs, 14 had ipsilateral RFs, and the rest (N=784) had contralateral RFs. The relative incidence of neurons with bilateral or ipsilateral RFs among identified neurons was less than 1% in areas 3a, 3b, and 1, and 16% or 25% in areas 2 or 5, respectively. Within areas 2 and 5, the percentage of neurons with bilateral or ipsilateral RFs was significantly smaller in the foot type (5%) than in other RF types (24-57%). RFs of the foot type were on the sole or single toe but never on multiple toes. These observations contrasted with the previous findings that neurons with bilateral RFs were more frequently seen in the hand and/or digit region and that RFs on multiple digit tips were dominant there. The present study thus demonstrated that neurons with bilateral RFs do exist in the hindlimb region. Similarly to the forelimb region, they were found mostly in areas 2 and 5, the caudalmost areas of the postcentral gyrus and hierarchically higher stages in information processing. The relative paucity of neurons with bilateral RFs on the foot, especially those with RFs on multiple toes, may reflect functional differences between the foot and the hand.", "pages": "310-4"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of subthalamic area for severe proximal tremor.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11020125", "authors": ["Kitagawa, M", "Murata, J", "Kikuchi, S", "Sawamura, Y", "Saito, H", "Sasaki, H", "Tashiro, K"], "year": "2000", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation by high frequency (HFS) has been developed starting in the thalamic target (Vim) from pragmatic observations and subsequently followed by other targets, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pallidum as an application of current knowledge from basic preclinical research in neuroscience. The mechanism involved by this neurosurgical approach is not completely solved. For Vim we have formed the hypothesis that HFS induces a jamming of sensory-motor loops but for the STN, from our experimental research in rats we have shown that HFS induces functional inhibition of cell activity in the target nuclei. In our patients the implantation of the stimulation electrodes was carried out stereotactically, under local anesthesia, using ventriculography, MRI, microrecordings and clinical evaluation of the effects of stimulation on rigidity. When the stimulation is turned ON in the STN area a significant decrease in rigidity was determined by the neurologists. Stimulation or even penetration of the electrode may be responsible for transient dyskinesias. The average location of the clinically efficient contact of the chronic stimulating electrodes is statistically located at 5.02 +/- 0.71 1/12 degrees of AC-PC in the AP direction, at -1.5 +/- 0.66 1/8 degrees of the height of the thalamus in the ventricle direction, with laterality at 11.98 +/- 1.12 mm in the lateral direction.

There is strong improvement of the symptoms of the triad in which akinesia, rigidity, and tremor are reduced on average to 41. 6, 48.6, and 27%, respectively, when compared with the previous preoperative level.
