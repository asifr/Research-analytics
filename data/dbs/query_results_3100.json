These symptoms can be improved when electrodes are implanted in deep brain structures and electrical stimulation is delivered chronically at high frequency (>100 Hz). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) onset or cessation affects PD signs with different latencies, and the long-term improvements of symptoms affecting the body axis and those affecting the limbs vary in duration. Interestingly, these effects have not been systematically analyzed and modeled. We compare these timing phenomena in relation to one axial (i.e., locomotion) and one distal (i.e., tremor) signs. We suggest that during DBS, these symptoms are improved by different network mechanisms operating at multiple time scales. Locomotion improvement may involve a delayed plastic reorganization, which takes hours to develop, whereas rest tremor is probably alleviated by an almost instantaneous desynchronization of neural activity in subcortical structures. Even if all PD patients develop both distal and axial symptoms sooner or later, current computational models of locomotion and rest tremor are separate. Furthermore, a few computational models of locomotion focus on PD and none exploring the effect of DBS was found in the literature. We, therefore, discuss a model of a neuronal network during DBS, general enough to explore the subcircuits controlling locomotion and rest tremor simultaneously. This model accounts for synchronization and plasticity, two mechanisms that are believed to underlie the two types of symptoms analyzed. We suggest that a hysteretic effect caused by DBS-induced plasticity and synchronization modulation contributes to the different therapeutic latencies observed. Such a comprehensive, generic computational model of DBS effects, incorporating these timing phenomena, should assist in developing a more efficient, faster, durable treatment of distal and axial signs in PD.", "pages": "E2"}, {"volume": "73", "title": "Long-term effects of pallidal deep brain stimulation in tardive dystonia.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15304657", "authors": ["Gruber, D", "Trottenberg, T", "Kivi, A", "Schoenecker, T", "Kopp, UA", "Hoffmann, KT", "Schneider, GH", "K\u00fchn, AA", "Kupsch, A"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "High-frequency stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is a highly effective therapy in primary dystonia.

Materials and Methods.\u2002Fourteen patients affected by movement disorders (12 Parkinson's disease and 2 progressive supranuclear palsy) underwent surgery for bilateral or monolateral implantation of stimulating electrodes in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. The correct placement of electrodes was established and verified by combining angio-CT scans with magnetic resonance imaging. Intraoperative and postoperative evaluations were made to assess the clinical effectiveness of stimulation according to different Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale items and neurophysiologic parameters. Results.\u2002No major complications occurred following the insertion of electrodes into the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Neuroimaging showed that the electrode contacts were always correctly placed below the ponto-mesencephalic line. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus improved gait, posture, and speech, and modulated reflexes integrated at spinal or pontine levels. Conclusions.\u2002The surgical targeting of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus requires a careful adaptation of the traditional stereotactic approaches owing to the high variability of brainstem anatomy from one patient to another. The insertion of the leads in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus as well as their activation did not appear to induce serious adverse effects. The correct positioning of stimulating electrodes in pontine structures such as the pedunculopontine nucleus may be ascertained not only through neuroimaging techniques but also through clinical neurophysiology. The evolution of the surgical planning that we have developed emphasizes the limited value of single-unit recordings to identify the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and highlights the opportunities offered by functional evaluations of neurophysiologic parameters.

PET measurements of glucose or oxygen consumption show a widespread approximately 45% reduction in cerebral energy consumption with anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. Because baseline brain energy consumption has been shown by (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be almost exclusively dedicated to neuronal signaling, we propose that the high level of brain energy is a necessary property of the conscious state. Two additional neuronal properties of the conscious state change with anesthesia. The delocalized fMRI activity patterns in rat brain during sensory stimulation at a higher energy state (close to the awake) collapse to a contralateral somatosensory response at lower energy state (deep anesthesia). Firing rates of an ensemble of neurons in the rat somatosensory cortex shift from the gamma-band range (20-40 Hz) at higher energy state to <10 Hz at lower energy state. With the conscious state defined by the individual's behavior and maintained by high cerebral energy, measurable properties of that state are the widespread fMRI patterns and high frequency neuronal activity, both of which support the extensive interregional communication characteristic of consciousness.

In those patients who showed a clinical placebo response, there was a decrease in firing rate in STN neurons that was associated with a decrease in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and an increase in the ventral anterior (VA) and anterior ventral lateral (VLa) thalamus. These data show that placebo decreases STN and SNr activity whereas it increases VA/VLa activity. By contrast, placebo non-responders showed either a lack of changes in this circuit or partial changes in the STN only. Thus, changes in activity in the whole basal ganglia-VA/VLa circuit appear to be important in order to observe a clinical placebo improvement, although the involvement of other circuits, such as the direct pathway bypassing the STN, cannot be ruled out.

We revisited this issue to examine the potential for generating rebound bursts in DCN cells in response to synaptic inputs in vitro. Both a Transient and Weak Burst phenotype could be distinguished in on-cell extracellular recordings or whole-cell recordings in response to inhibitory synaptic input. We found that the rebound burst response was a sensitive function of stimulus intensity, such that increasing stimulus intensity significantly raised the probability for evoking bursts while decreasing pause duration. The threshold for reliably generating rebound bursts was approximately 40 percent of maximum intensity, a level that evokes an IPSC corresponding to only a small number of the inhibitory terminals known to impinge on DCN cells.

Such measures offer clinical utility as reliable and objective indicators of brain dysfunction in individuals and indicate potential as biomarkers for the improvement of diagnostic specificity and for informing treatment decisions and prognostic assessments. Common to most of the anxiety disorders is basal instability in cortical arousal, as reflected in measures of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) measures tend to correlate with symptom sub-patterns and be exacerbated by condition-specific stimulation. Also common to most of the anxiety disorders are condition-specific difficulties with sensory gating and the allocation and deployment of attention. These are clearly evident from evoked potential (EP) and event-related potential (ERP) electrical measures of information processing in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the phobias. Other'ERP measures clearly differentiate the disorders. However, there is considerable variation across studies, with inclusion and exclusion criteria, medication status and control group selection not standardized within condition or across studies. Study numbers generally preclude analysis for confound removal or for the derivation of diagnostic biomarker patterns at this time.

After the intervention, the patient was able to perform voluntary movements of outward rotation and abduction in the right foot and begin gait rehabilitation.

While apomorphine provides a similar level of motor benefit to levodopa, its long-term use is limited by compliance and injection site skin reactions. The administration of levodopa/carbidopa by continuous duodenal infusion allows replacement of all oral medications and permits achievement of a satisfactory therapeutic response paralleled by a reduction in motor complication severity. However, compared with apomorphine, it is more invasive as it requires a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.", "pages": "E2"}, {"volume": "92", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens reduces ethanol consumption in rats.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "14060771", "authors": ["Knapp, CM", "Tozier, L", "Pak, A", "Ciraulo, DA", "Kornetsky, C"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior", "abstract": "Recent studies have improved our knowledge of the factors responsible for the development of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease and the associated pathophysiology.

Neurophysiological studies have suggested that dyskinesias might reflect abnormal skill memorization processes within the cortico-subcortical loops.
