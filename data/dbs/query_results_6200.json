Modulation of the seizure threshold by stimulation of deep brain structures-in particular, of the STN-is a promising future treatment option for patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy.

However the oxygen-to-glucose index (OGI), which is the ratio of metabolic rates of oxygen to glucose, CMR(O2)/CMR(glc), diverges from the theoretical value of 6 as activity is increased. In vivo measurements of brain lactate show its concentration to increase with stimulation. The decreasing OGI with stimulation had led to the suggestion that activation, unlike resting activity, is supported by anaerobic glycolysis. To date a unifying concept that accommodates glucose oxidation at rest with lactate generation and OGI decrease during stimulation of brain is lacking. Furthermore, energetics that change with increasing activity are not consistent with a neuroenergetic model that has been proposed from 1-(13)C-glucose MRS experiments. That model, based upon in vivo MRS measurements and cellular studies by Pellerin and Magistretti, showed that glutamate neurotransmitter cycling was coupled to glucose oxidation over a wide range of brain activities from rest down to deep anesthesia. Here we reconcile these paradoxical observations by suggesting that anaerobic glucose consumption (which can provide energy rapidly) increases with activation to meet the power requirements of millisecond neuronal firing. It is proposed, in accord with our neuroenergetic model, that the extra glucose mobilized rapidly for glial clearance of glutamate, is not needed for the oxidative processes that are responsible for neuronal firing and glutamate release, and consequently it is effluxed as lactate. A stoichiometric relation between OGI and lactate concentration is derived from the neuroenergetic model, showing that the enhanced glucose uptake during activation is consistent with neuronal activity being energetically supported by glucose oxidation.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "171", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus lesions are neuroprotective against terminal 6-OHDA-induced striatal lesions and restore postural balancing reactions.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11786221", "authors": ["Carvalho, GA", "Nikkhah, G"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Word recall is facilitated when deep (e.g. semantic) processing is applied during encoding.

In rodents, ETX results in susceptibility to audiogenic seizures (AGS), and the DLSC are implicated as a critical component of the seizure network in a genetic form of AGS. Ethanol inhibits NMDA receptors, and the binding at these receptors is increased during ETX in certain brain regions. Therefore, the effect of focal microinjection into DLSC of a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP7) on ETX seizures was examined. AP7 (2 and 5 nmol/side) microinjected bilaterally into DLSC suppressed AGS, supporting a critical role of the DLSC in the AGS network during ETX. DLSC neuronal firing changes in behaving rats were subsequently examined, using chronically implanted microwire electrodes. Acoustically-evoked DLSC firing was significantly suppressed during ethanol intoxication and during ETX. However, DLSC neurons began firing tonically 1-2 s before the onset of the wild running behavior of AGS. Acoustically-evoked DLSC firing was suppressed during post-ictal depression with recovery beginning as the righting reflex returned. These data support a requisite role of the DLSC in AGS during ETX. These neuronal firing changes suggest an important role of DLSC neurons in generation of the wild running phase of AGS during ETX, which may be a general pathophysiological mechanism and a critical event in the initiation of wild running, since a similar pattern was seen previously in a genetic form of AGS.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "248", "title": "Influence of chronic bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "8783009", "authors": ["Dujardin, K", "Defebvre, L", "Krystkowiak, P", "Blond, S", "Dest\u00e9e, A"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Aim of our study was to investigate the different effects on attentional capacity of deep brain stimulation DBS (STN or GPi) and of l-dopa in PD patients.

Whether response enhancement or response depression is produced by this multisensory interaction is predictable based on several factors. These include: the organization of a neuron's visual and nonvisual receptive fields; the relative spatial relationships of the different stimuli (to their respective receptive fields and to one another); and whether or not the neuron is innervated by a select population of cortical neurons. The response enhancement or depression of SC neurons via multisensory integration has significant survival value via its profound impact on overt attentive/orientation behaviors.

This physiological capacity is, in turn, closely tied to changes in overt attentive and orientation responses. The present study shows that, in contrast to more altricial species, many deep layer SC neurons in the rhesus monkey are multisensory at birth. Such neurons can respond to stimuli from different sensory modalities, and all convergence patterns seen in the adult are represented. Nevertheless, these neurons cannot yet synthesize their multisensory inputs. Rather, they respond to combinations of cross-modal stimuli much like they respond to their individual modality-specific components. This immature property of multisensory neurons is in contrast to many of the surprisingly sophisticated modality-specific response properties of these neurons and of their modality-specific neighbors. Thus, although deep SC neurons in the newborn have longer latencies and larger receptive fields than their adult counterparts, they are already highly active and are distributed in the typical adult admixture of visual, auditory, somatosensory, and multisensory neurons. Furthermore, the receptive fields of these neurons are already ordered into well organized topographic maps, and the different receptive fields of the same multisensory neurons show a good degree of cross-modal spatial register. These data, coupled with those from cat, suggest that the capacity to synthesize multisensory information does not simply appear in SC neurons at a prescribed maturational stage but rather develops only after substantial experience with cross-modal cues.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Physiologic study of the subthalamic volume.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "9827607", "authors": ["Zincone, A", "Landi, A", "Piolti, R", "Appollonio, I", "Mariani, CB", "Pezzoli, G", "Gaini, SM", "Frattola, L"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Chronic high frequency (130 Hz) stimulation (HFS) of the thalamic target Vim, first used in our group in 1987 as a treatment of tremor of various origins, has been used over the last ten years in 137 patients. Since 1993, this method has been extended to two other targets (subthalamic nucleus (STN): 137 patients and the medial pallidum (GPi): 12 patients), based on recent experimental data in rats and monkeys. STN appears to be a target of major interest, able to control the three cardinal symptoms and to allow the decrease or suppression of levodopa treatment, which then also suppresses levodopa induced dyskinesias. The stereotactic technique is based on the determination of the target using ventriculography, MRI and electrophysiology, with both microrecording of single neuron activity and microstimulation inducing therapeutic symptom suppression and side effects. Chronic electrodes are then placed bilaterally at the best physiologically defined location and then connected to implantable stimulators (either 2 Itrel II or the new double channel Kinetra), operated at 130-185 Hz, 60 ms pulse width, 2.5 to 3.5 volts. There was no operative mortality and permanent morbidity was observed in 3 patients. The mechanisms of action of HFS are not fully understood, but are definitely related to high frequency and are probably different depending on the target. Inhibition of cellular activity or of neural network functions could be induced, by jamming of a retroactive loop for tremor, or by shutdown of neurotransmitter release in STN. Mechanisms within an individual target are also probably different for tremor or for other symptom alleviation. All cardinal symptoms are alleviated from tremor to akinesia and rigidity. This strong improvement allows the decrease of the drug dosage to approximately 30% of the preoperative level, which suppresses the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The off period dystonias are also suppressed as well as freezings and falls. The effects remain stable over more than 5 years and in the same period, the off stimulation-off medication UPDRS remains stable and does not increase at the usual rate The low rate of permanent complications, the minor side effects and their immediate reversibility, the possibility of bilateral implantation in one session and the long-term persistence of symptom relief are strong arguments which support chronic HFS of STN as the method of choice when a surgical procedure is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and even more when a bilateral procedure is necessary. Recent data show that STN stimulation could be useful in the treatment of dystonia as well as some forms of epilepsy.

To assess the brain's role in this 'emotional' hyperthermia, temperatures were continuously recorded in dorsal and ventral striatum and in deep temporal muscle of freely moving rats exposed to different arousing and mild stress stimuli (placement in the test cage, 20-s sound stimulation, i.v. saline injection, 3-min social interaction with conspecific, and 3-min tail-pinch). The stimuli caused brain hyperthermia of differing degrees but similar pattern, in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Ventral striatum had approximately 0.4 degrees C higher basal temperature than dorsal striatum, each of these brain temperatures was higher than that in deep temporal muscle. Maximal increases in brain temperature ( approximately 0.8-1.2 degrees C for 20-40 min) occurred upon placement in the test cages, during tail-pinch and during social interaction, all of which were accompanied by behavioral activation. These increases developed with short onset latencies (up to 5-15 s) and always preceded increases in muscle temperature. Significant but smaller increases in brain temperature ( approximately 0.2 degrees C for 4-6 min) were detected after sound stimulation and i.v. saline injection that induced minimal changes in behavior and no change in muscle temperature. Thus, it appears that brain hyperthermia can be triggered by quite different arousing or stressful stimuli that disturb an organism's homeostasis and demand adaptive responding. Although the exact mechanisms of local heat production in brain tissue remain to be confirmed, neuronal activation appears to be the primary triggering force behind changes in brain temperature that are sufficient to affect body temperature. Because most neural processes are temperature-dependent, change in local temperature may result in dramatic modulation of the efficiency of neural processes in situations critical for life-support and during adaptive behavior.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "71", "title": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease: effects of variation in stimulation parameters.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10084526", "authors": ["Rizzone, M", "Lanotte, M", "Bergamasco, B", "Tavella, A", "Torre, E", "Faccani, G", "Melcarne, A", "Lopiano, L"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The objective was to investigate the long term safety and efficacy of unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the VIM nucleus of the thalamus in Parkinson's disease.

In addition, animals with combined STN and striatal lesions exhibited a significant recovery in postural balancing reactions induced by 6-OHDA terminal lesions and did not show a significant impairment in any of the other behavioral parameters examined.

In another GPi patient, preliminary negative tests with the electrodes discouraged implantation of the stimulators, and the patient was not treated with chronic DBS. In the remaining group of eight patients including those previously treated with VLp DBS, chronic GPi DBS resulted in a significant improvement in the dystonia movement scale and disability scores.

Recently renewed interest in stereotaxy for dystonia has followed the resurgence of pallidotomy and the introduction of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) in the early 1990s. However, even since the 1950s, small series of patients treated with ablative surgery have been carefully studied, providing useful information, notably regarding the tolerability of surgery. In the setting of dystonia, thalamotomy was first performed with substantial benefits, but some authors outlined the great variability in outcome, and the high incidence of operative side-effects. In the 'modern' era of functional surgery for movement disorders, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) has emerged to be currently the best target for dystonia, based on small series of patients published in the last few years. Both bilateral posteroventral pallidotomy (PVP) and bilateral pallidal stimulation, performed by several teams, have benefited a variety of patients with severe dystonia, the most dramatic improvements being seen in primary dystonia with a mutation in the DYT1 gene. Whereas patients with secondary dystonia have often shown a lesser degree of improvement, some publications have nevertheless reported major benefit. There is today a strong need for carefully controlled studies comparing secondary and primary dystonia, DYT1 and non-DYT1 dystonia, ablative surgery and DBS, with additional assessment of neuropsychological changes, especially in children treated with bilateral pallidal procedures.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "8", "title": "Deep brain stimulation: the case for.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "3989783", "authors": ["O'Sullivan, DJ"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "abstract": "The functional organization of area 3a, a cortical field proposed to be involved in somato-motor-vestibular integration, has never been described for any primate. In the present investigation, the topographic organization and connections of area 3a were examined in marmosets using electrophysiological recording and anatomical tracing techniques. Multi-unit neuronal activity was recorded at a number of closely spaced sites; receptive fields (RFs) for neurons were determined, and the optimal stimulus was identified. In all cases, neurons in area 3a responded to the stimulation of deep receptors on the contralateral body. The representation of the body in area 3a was from the toes and foot, to the hindlimb, trunk, forelimb, hand and face in a mediolateral progression. In all cases electrophysiological results were related to myeloarchitecture, and the map in area 3a was found to be coextensive with a strip of lightly to moderately myelinated cortex just rostral to the darkly myelinated 3b. To examine the cortical connections of area 3a, injections of anatomical tracers were made into electrophysiologically identified body part representations. Area 3a has dense intrinsic connections and receives substantial inputs from the primary motor cortex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), areas 1 and 2, the second somatosensory area (S2), and areas in posterior parietal cortex (PP). The connections of area 3a indicate that integration of cortical representations of body parts occurs both within area 3a and between area 3a and other somatosensory and motor areas. In addition, there are differential patterns of interconnections between behaviorally relevant body part representations of area 3a, such as the forelimb, compared to other body part representations (hindlimb/ trunk), especially with 'higher order' cortical fields. This suggests that 3a may be an important component in a network that generates a common frame of reference for hand and eye coordinated reaching tasks.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Current and emerging treatments in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "4139420", "authors": ["Tan, AK"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore", "abstract": "This gene transfer experiment is the first Parkinson's Disease (PD) protocol to be submitted to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. The principal investigators have uniquely focused their careers on both pre-clinical work on gene transfer in the brain and clinical expertise in management and surgical treatment of patients with PD. They have extensively used rodent models of PD for proof-of-principle experiments on the utility of different vector systems. PD is an excellent target for gene therapy, because it is a complex acquired disease of unknown etiology (apart from some rare familial cases) yet it is characterized by a specific neuroanatomical pathology, the degeneration of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) with loss of dopamine input to the striatum. This pathology results in focal changes in the function of several deep brain nuclei, which have been well-characterized in humans and animal models and which account for many of the motor symptoms of PD. Our original approaches, largely to validate in vivo gene transfer in the brain, were designed to facilitate dopamine transmission in the striatum using an AAV vector expressing dopamine-synthetic enzymes. Although these confirmed the safety and potential efficacy of AAV, complex patient responses to dopamine augmenting medication as well as poor results and complications of human transplant studies suggested that this would be a difficult and potentially dangerous clinical strategy using current approaches. Subsequently, we and others investigated the use of growth factors, including GDNF. These showed some encouraging effects on dopamine neuron survival and regeneration in both rodent and primate models; however, uncertain consequences of long-term growth factor expression and question regarding timing of therapy in the disease course must be resolved before any clinical study can be contemplated. We now propose to infuse into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) recombinant AAV vectors expressing the two isoforms of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-65 and GAD-67), which synthesizes the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA. The STN is a very small nucleus (140 cubic mm or 0.02% of the total brain volume, consisting of approximately 300,000 neurons) which is disinhibited in PD, leading to pathological excitation of its targets, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). Increased GPi/SNpr outflow is believed responsible for many of the cardinal symptoms of PD, i.e., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbance. A large amount of data based on lesioning, electrical stimulation, and local drug infusion studies with GABA-agonists in human PD patients have reinforced this circuit model of PD and the central role of the STN. Moreover, the closest conventional surgical intervention to our proposal, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN, has shown remarkable efficacy in even late stage PD, unlike the early failures associated with recombinant GDNF infusion or cell transplantation approaches in PD. We believe that our gene transfer strategy will not only palliate symptoms by inhibiting STN activity, as with DBS, but we also have evidence that the vector converts excitatory STN projections to inhibitory projections. This additional dampening of outflow GPi/SNpr outflow may provide an additional advantage over DBS. Moreover, of perhaps the greatest interest, our preclinical data suggests that this strategy may also be neuroprotective, so this therapy may slow the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. We will use both GAD isoforms since both are typically expressed in inhibitory neurons in the brain, and our data suggest that the combination of both isoforms is likely to be most beneficial. Our preclinical data includes three model systems: (1) old, chronically lesioned parkinsonian rats in which intraSTN GAD gene transfer results not only in improvement in both drug-induced asymmetrical behavior (apomorphine symmetrical rotations), but also in spontaneous behaviors. In our second model, GAD gene transfer precedes the generation of a dopamine lesion. Here GAD gene transfer showed remarkable neuroprotection. Finally, we carried out a study where GAD-65 and GAD-67 were used separately in monkeys that were resistant to MPTP lesioning and hence showed minimal symptomatology. Nevertheless GAD gene transfer showed no adverse effects and small improvements in both Parkinson rating scales and activity measures were obtained. In the proposed clinical trial, all patients will have met criteria for and will have given consent for STN DBS elective surgery. Twenty patients will all receive DBS electrodes, but in addition they will be randomized into two groups, to receive either a solution containing rAAV-GAD, or a solution which consists just of the vector vehicle, physiological saline. Patients, care providers, and physicians will be blind as to which solution any one patient receives. All patients, regardless of group, will agree to not have the DBS activated until the completion and unblinding of the study. Patients will be assessed with a core clinical assessment program modeled on the CAPSIT, and in addition will also undergo a preop and several postop PET scans. At the conclusion of the study, if any patient with sufficient symptomatic improvement will be offered DBS removal if they so desire. Any patients with no benefit will simply have their stimulators activated, which would normally be appropriate therapy for them and which requires no additional operations. If any unforeseen symptoms occur from STN production of GABA, this might be controlled by blocking STN GABA release with DBS, or STN lesioning could be performed using the DBS electrode. Again, this treatment would not subject the patient to additional invasive brain surgery. The trial described here reflects an evolution in our thinking about the best strategy to make a positive impact in Parkinson Disease by minimizing risk and maximizing potential benefit. To our knowledge, this proposal represents the first truly blinded, completely controlled gene or cell therapy study in the brain, which still provides the patient with the same surgical procedure which they would normally receive and should not subject the patient to additional surgical procedures regardless of the success or failure of the study. This study first and foremost aims to maximally serve the safety interests of the individual patient while simultaneously serving the public interest in rigorously determining in a scientific fashion if gene therapy can be effective to any degree in treating Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "108-13"}, {"volume": "101", "title": "Thalamic stimulation in neuropathic pain: 27 years later.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "5035310", "authors": ["Gybels, J"], "year": "2001", "journal": "Acta neurologica Belgica", "abstract": "Chronic bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is known to improve motor function in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).
