After finishing his work, he fell into unconsciousness and drowned. Sometime later, he was rescued and treated as decompression sickness. When he became alert, severe action myoclonus and epileptic seizure appeared. 8 years later, he was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation. The danger of diving without equipment was indicated, because in sea bottom alveolar oxygen pressure (Pao2) is about 450 mmHg and alveolar air pressure 4.5 atmospheric pressure. In this condition patient could hold his breath longer time than in sea surface. When he finished his work and floated with muscle relaxing, however, his blood supply to the brain decreased. It was thought, therefore, that he fell into unconsciousness and drowned. In somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) by median nerve stimulation, giat patterns were recognized but there were differences between SEP of myoclonus epilepsy and that of this patient. P50 and N70-80 were giant in him, suggesting that he had a brain stem disturbance. Since the inhibition system of fast conducted fiber did not work well in this state, the component of slow conducted fiber was magnified.

Stimulation applied within SN activates not only the nigral neurons but also fibers passing through and in the vicinity of SN, especially those of cerebral peduncle (Ped) and optic tract (OT). The effect of SN stimulation has therefore been reinvestigated on two types of preparation: firstly in animals whose Ped--OT fibers were transected rostral to SN; and secondly in rats whose nigral cells destroyed by kainic acid injection. In normal animals, SN stimulation induced both inhibitory and excitatory responses in SC cells. After transection of Ped--OT fibers, SN stimulation no longer induced excitatory but only inhibitory effects. This observation clearly demonstrates that the nigro-tectal pathway is inhibitory. The excitatory responses observed in normal rats are related to activation of Ped--OT fibers at the level of SN. Indeed these excitations induced by SN stimulation still persist in kainic acid lesioned animals. Moreover, stimulation of Ped--OT fibers applied rostral to SN also produce these excitatory effects on SC cells. On the other hand, Ped--OT stimulation not only induces excitations but also inhibitory responses. These latter effects can still be evoked by SN stimulation after kainic acid induced loss of nigral cells. In conclusion the SC receives both excitatory and inhibitory input from Ped--OT fibers and only inhibitory input from nigral cells.

Vestibular branching interstitiospinal and reticulospinal neurons were also identified as in the previous experiments. Stimulation of the ipsilateral pericruciate cortex evoked firing in 31% of N cells, 41% of D cells and 35% of the vestibular branching neurons, while stimulation of the contralateral cortex excited 6% of N cells, 29% of D cells and 14% of vestibular branching neurons.

By measuring the thresholds of activation of these neurons while changing the depth of the stimulating electrodes, and by mapping the cortical areas, it was shown that the lowest threshold areas were in the frontal eye fields and the anterior sigmoid gyrus near the presylvian sulcus (Area 6). Stimulation of the latter area often evoked neck or shoulder muscles contraction. Stimulation in the deep layers of the ipsilateral superior colliculus evoked firing in about 20% of interstitiospinal neurons and about 42% of vestibular branching neurons, with typical latencies 2-3 ms after the effective pulse, while stimulation of the contralateral superior colliculus was rarely effective.

An additional 108 LDP cells were not activated by the natural stimuli used, but some of these fired spike potentials in response to electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves of the forelimb. There was no distinction between neurons activated and those not activated by natural stimuli on the basis of location or conduction velocity. (2) The most effective natural stimuli were mechanical manipulation of the skin (both low and high threshold), movement of joints of the paw, and pressure to the deep tissues, especially to the extensor side of the arm. These modalities of stimuli were most often excitatory, but could be inhibitory as well. (3) On the basis of modality, 4 subgroups of LDP cells were identified: those which were responsive only to mechanical-cutaneous, joint-movement, or deep-pressure stimuli, and those which responded to several of these modalities of stimuli, the multimodal group. These subgroups could not be distinguished on the basis of conduction velocity. (4) The receptive fields varied in size from small (one digit) to large (all of a forelimb). For single LDP cells they included ones with single and/or multimodal input from one or both forelimbs and various combinations of excitation and/or inhibition. However, those in the dorsal horn had only ipsilateral receptive fields, mainly of the mechanical-cutaneous type.

Supplementum", "abstract": "1. Single-unit activity was recorded from the superior colliculus (SC) of monkeys trained to look to visual targets presented on an oscilloscope screen. On one task, target localization required that information concerning the retinal position of the target be combined with information concerning current or future eye position. This task also permitted a dissociation between the site of retinal stimulation and the metrics of the saccade triggered by the stimulation. 2. Vigorous visual responses of superficial SC neurons may occur that do not result in the activation of underlying saccade-related cells. The activity of these neurons signals the occurrence of a visual stimulus, whether or not the stimulus is selected for foveal viewing. 3. Saccade-related (SR) discharges of most intermediate and deep-layer SC neurons precede saccades with particular vectors, regardless of the region of retinal activation initiating the saccade. The discharge of these neurons is tightly coupled to saccade onset, even if changes in eye position have occurred since target appearance. Thus, the discharge of these SR neurons must occur after retinal error and eye-position signals have been combined to compute the necessary saccade vector. For most SR neurons, direct retinal activation of overlying visual neurons had no effect on either the vigor or probability of a SR discharge. The discharge of overlying visual cells is neither necessary nor sufficient to activate most SR cells. 4. The discharge of some SR cells is dependent on prior activation of overlying visual cells. Of 53 SR cells, only 3 were completely dependent on visual stimulation, while another 8 discharged less vigorously if corresponding visual activation failed to occur. 5. About one-quarter of the SR cells showed long-lead preburst activity. This activation was characterized by a low level of firing, which began after the saccade signal and continued until a saccade-linked burst occurred. 6. Cells were isolated that were visually responsive yet discharged prior to saccades in the absence of appropriate retinal stimulation. No component of the discharge of these quasi-visual (QV) cells appeared to be motor in the usual sense. The activity of these neurons appears to reflect eye-position error (the difference between actual and desired eye position) and to hold this information in spatial register until a saccade occurs or is cancelled. 7. It is concluded that the presumed linkage, implied in earlier versions of the foveation hypothesis, between the superficial layers (receiving direct retinal inputs) and the deeper layers of the SC is not necessary for the activation of SR neurons. Results suggest that the SC must generate or receive a signal that combines retinal error and eye-position information.

After stimulus-induced extracellular [K+] elevations the delta [TMA+] and delta [Ch+] signals recorded with nominally K+-selective liquid ion-exchanger microelectrodes increased by up to 100%, thus indicating a reduction of the ES down to one half of its initial size. The shrinkage was maximal at sites where the K+ release into the ES was also largest. At very superficial and deep layers, however, considerable increases in extracellular K+ concentration were not accompanied by significant reductions in the ES. These findings can be explained as a consequence of K+ movement through spatially extended cell structures. Calculations based on a model combining the spatial buffer mechanism of Kuffler and Nicholls (1966) to osmolarity changes caused by selective K+ transport through primarily K+ permeable membranes support this concept. Following stimulation additional iontophoretically induced [K+]0 rises were reduced in amplitude by up to 35%, even at sites where maximal decreases of the ES were observed.

The field potentials and unit activities evoked by the alvear tract (AT) in CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus of rats were studied under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. 2. The localized activity evoked anterior to an AT stimulus began as a compound action potential, followed by a slower negative wave, and ended in a long-lasting, slow positive wave. Observed with a 64-electrode recording array, topographical projections of the AT in CA1 were seen as parallel strips inclined at an angle of 5-30 degrees medially from the sagittal plane. 3. Three overlapping components in the averaged evoked potentials (AEPs) were distinguished. The first event (component I) was a brief compound antidromic action potential of pyramidal cells. The second field event (component II) reversed from surface negative to deep positive at 200 micrometer from the ventricular surface, increased rapidly with stimulus intensity, potentiated with double shocks, and followed stimulus frequency up to 50/s. The third component was long lasting (up to 200 ms), surface positive and ventral negative (turnover at 150 micron below the pyramidal layer), followed stimulus frequency up to about 10/s, and saturated at a low stimulus intensity (about 3 x threshold). 4. In some preparations, another fast negative peak of about 2 ms duration was found to follow the axon compound action potential on the hippocampal surface and appeared to propagate from the pyramidal layer to the ventricular surface. It was probably of nonsynaptic origin, perhaps due to the centrifugal basal dendritic spikes of the pyramidal cells. 5. Single units were recorded in CA1. Antidromic units were identified by their firing at a fixed latency (1.5 ms) and ability to follow high stimulus frequencies. Units firing at about 2.7 ms latency possessed characteristics of monosynaptic excitation. Under light anesthesia, many of the latter units also showed a late, prolonged suppression of background firing. Tentative interneuronal types fired with peak latencies of 4-5 ms or showed prolonged increase in firing rate. 6.

Ipsilateral IPSPs were eliminated only by deep lesions extending for about 1.5 mm rostral and caudal to the 6th nuclei. 5. Investigation of medial rectus motoneurons (MR-MNs) revealed two types of excitatory responses to CS-stimulation: (a) di- or trisynaptic EPSPs characterized by a fast rising phase and pronounced frequency potentiation; (b) slowly rising EPSPs displaying little or no frequency potentiation. 'Fast' EPSPs were abolished by all types of pontine lesions interrupting transmission through the contralateral 'abducens region' and may thus be relayed by internuclear neurons within or adjacent to the 6th nucleus. 'Slow' EPSPs persisted after transverse sections at midpontine and rostral pontine levels. 6. The trajectory of tectofugal inhibitory pathway to MR-MNs could not be followed due to a marked suppression of IPSPs under pentobarbital anesthesia.

This is no easy matter in the rhesus monkey, an animal close to man, where the cytoarchitecturally uniform prestriate cortex is folded into deep sulci with secondary gyri. One way around this awkward problem is to use the callosal connections of the prestriate cortex as the anatomical landmarks. Callosal connections are restricted to regions at which the vertical meridian is represented. Since the visual fields, including the vertical meridian, are separately represented in each area, each has its own callosal connections. These are of great help in defining some of the boundaries of these areas, since the boundaries often coincide with the representation of the vertical meridian. With the visual areas thus defined anatomically, it becomes relatively easy to assign recordings to particular areas. Studies of binocular interactions in these areas reveal that most cells in all prestriate areas are binocularly driven. Hence, theoretically, all of the prestriate areas are candidates for stereoscopic mechanisms. The degree of binocular interaction varies from cell to cell. At the two extremes are cells which either respond to monocular stimulation only and are inhibited by binocular stimulation or ones which respond to binocular stimulation only. Changing, as opposed to fixed, disparity is signalled by two types of cells. In one category are cells activated in opposite directions for the two eyes. Such cells are always binocularly driven.

Twenty-one of these 73 neurones had convergent inputs. The latencies of activation of units in VPLo were short (4--8 ms) and consistent with a lemniscal pathway via the dorsal column nuclei. Injection of horseradish peroxidase into the arm area of the motor cortex labelled cells in VPLo and not in VPLc. The neurones from which recordings were made in VPLo were located within the population of cells labelled with horseradish peroxidase after injections into the primary motor area.

Very deep barbiturate anesthesia (sufficient to depress the EEG) led to decreased responses to the primary pulse but augmented responses to the test pulse. Urethane and ether anesthesia produced augmented test responses without severely depressing the EEG and without producing a period of diminished test responses. Single unit recordings failed to show external plexiform layer units excited at the time of maximal augmentation of the field potential. Simultaneous single unit and field potential recordings showed that prolonged diminution of the field potential response was associated with prolonged suppression of unit responses to the test pulse, while augmented field potential responses were associated with decreased suppression of unit responses to the test pulse.

Observations were made on frequency and tidal volume of breathing, on CO(2) responsiveness and on electrical responsiveness of the respiratory centre. Effects on the blood pressure were observed simultaneously.2 A single large dose of toxin, e.g., 250 ng, produced within minutes apneustic breathing and a rise in blood pressure which were converted rapidly to respiratory failure and hypotension. In contrast, repeated small doses, e.g., 25 ng, yielded only progressive slowing of the respiration together with circulatory hypotension. Bulbar depression was produced as effectively by subarachnoid injection as by intraventricular injection of the toxins. Onset of action was detectable within seconds.3 Slowing of the respiration occurred independently of change in tidal volume and whether or not the vagus nerves were cut. The reduction in breathing frequency is attributed to direct toxin-induced depression of the central respiratory oscillator.4 Steady-state measurements of tidal volume at controlled levels of alveolar CO(2) pressure in intermediate stages of respiratory depression showed that the toxins produced an increase in CO(2) stimulation threshold as well as a reduction in gain of CO(2) responsiveness, whether or not the vagus nerves were cut. Carotid arterial chemoreceptor reactivity to O(2) was demonstrable when central sensitivity to CO(2) was depressed. These effects are attributed to a direct influence of the toxins upon the brainstem CO(2)-tidal volume controller.5 Responsiveness of the medullary inspiratory centre to electrical stimulation persisted after the failure of spontaneous breathing was caused by the toxins. Conversely, restitution of electrical responsiveness preceded the reappearance of spontaneous respiratory activity in the recovery phase of toxic depression. Circulatory effects paralleled the changes in respiratory behaviour.6 On the basis of the relatively prompt and discrete alterations in the central respiratory and circulatory control mechanisms produced by saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin placed in the cerebrospinal fluid, it is concluded that the agents rapidly penetrated to deep target loci in the lower brain stem.", "pages": "367-75"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "[Arrest reaction in man: motor arrest response by electrical stimulation of the deep structure of the cerebrum (author's transl)].", "issue": "4", "pmid": "216303", "authors": ["Kwak, R", "Okudaira, Y", "Sakamoto, T"], "year": "1978", "journal": "N\u014d to shinkei = Brain and nerve", "abstract": "In order to advance the practical application of measuring evoked cortical responses following electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist (SEP) in clinical neurology, diagnostic criteria, consisting of the onset latency, peak latency and 2 indices of the first 3 negative components, and their left-and-right differences, were proposed and applied to 65 patients with cerebral lesions of various aetiologies. The criteria used were shown to be very useful in distinguishing between normal subjects and patients with cerebral lesions. The N1 and N2 components were related to the involvement of sensory pathways and were commonly associated with sensory impairment of all modalities or of deep proprioceptive and cortical modalities. The N3 component, on the other hand, was related to the presence of lesions and non-specific sites as well as non-specific symptomatology. SEP, judged by the present criteria, was shown to be useful as a complementary diagnostic aid in localizing the sites of lesions in sensory pathways and in evaluating sensory function, especially when used in combination with clinical symptomatology.", "pages": "367-75"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "Studies on the influence of monoamines on the cerebrovascular response to arterial hypoxia.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "551056", "authors": ["Ekstr\u00f6m-Jodal, B", "Elfverson, J", "von Essen, C"], "year": "1978", "journal": "Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "abstract": "Experiments were performed to determine if a nucleocortical system, a projection from the cerebellar nuclei to the cerebellar cortex, was present in primates. Both electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques were employed to investigate this question. It was shown that neurons within the dentate and interposed nuclei were antidromically activated by stimuli applied to the cerebellar cortex. In addition, cells in these nuclei were retrogradely labelled following injections of small amounts of horseradish peroxidase in the cerebellar cortex. The injection of tritiated leucine in the deep nuclei resulted in the labelling of fibers projecting from these structures to the cerebellar cortex which appeared to terminate within the granular layer. Additional electrophysiological studies showed that neurons projecting to the cerebellar cortex could also be antidromically activated from the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, indicating that the nucleocortical projection in the primate arises at least in part as collaterals from neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei which also project to extracerebellar structures, as was shown in the cat.", "pages": "367-75"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Intracellular recordings from the motor cortex during EEG arousal in unanaesthetized brain preparations of the cat.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "501389", "authors": ["Inubushi, S", "Kobayashi, T", "Oshima, T", "Torii, S"], "year": "1978", "journal": "The Japanese journal of physiology", "abstract": "The vestibular thalamic relay in the Rhesus ventrobasal complex, identified in a previous field potential study (part I, Deecke et al., 1974), has now been investigated with neuronal recordings in the thalamus in order to clarify its functional role. In part I, short latency responses (2.5 msec) were found in the corner between VPL, VPM and VPI nuclei, largely including dorsal portions of the VPI nucleus. Field potentials of somewhat longer latency (4-5 msec) were recorded in VPL and in other thalamic nuclei, including the posterior nuclear group. Neuronal responses were recorded in thalamic nuclei of awake flaxedilized Rhesus monkeys. Cells not responding to vestibular stimulation (round window polarisation of either labyrinth) were ignored. The great majority (80%) of those neurons responding to labyrinth polarisation showed convergence with deep somatic (proprioceptive) input from joints and muscles of vertebral column and limbs. 60% of these bimodal neurons responded to movement of cervical joints. Very few vestibularly responsive cells received cutaneous (6.6%), non-optokinetic visual or auditory (2.6% each) input. Proprioceptive fields tended to be large, frequently involving more than one joint, and could be even bilateral. For a few cells the pattern of vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence could be fitted to a coordinated body position that might occur during normal locomotion. 78% of the cells responded to polarisation of both labyrinths, indicating strong bilateral projection.", "pages": "367-75"}, {"volume": "41", "title": "Arrest reaction in man.
