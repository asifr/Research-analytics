Also, CaMKIV deficiency results in impaired long-term depression (LTD) induction in cerebellar cortex. To investigate the function of CaMKIV in the cerebellum, Wild-type (WT) and CaMKIV KO mice were tested with delay eyeblink conditioning. KO and WT mice did not differ in acquisition, but the KO mice showed a significantly lower conditioned response (CR) percentage than the WT mice in the retention testing and retraining period. The CR peak latencies for the two groups did not differ in acquisition but were shorter for the KO mice in the testing period. No significant differences were found between KO and WT mice in spontaneous eyeblink activity, auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes, and tail-flick latency.

Using this knowledge as a framework, we then explore a specific hypothesis regarding DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of PD. This hypothesis states that therapeutic benefit is provided, at least in part, by activation of surviving nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, subsequent striatal dopamine release, and resumption of striatal target cell control by dopamine. While highly controversial, we present preliminary data that are consistent with specific predications testing this hypothesis.

This study aims to provide estimates of these complications for movement disorders, pain and psychiatric conditions. A literature review was performed. Because searches using the terms seizure, epilepsy, and deep brain stimulation revealed only papers dealing with experimental and clinical application of DBS to treat chronic seizures disorders, a search strategy trawling through papers that described clinical case series of DBS was used. Thirty-two papers were reviewed that described stereotactic placement of DBS electrodes for movement disorders, pain syndromes and psychiatric conditions with cohorts of n > 5. Sixteen of these papers describing at least 1418 DBS electrode placements in 1254 patients did not mention seizures as a complication (i.e., it was not possible to know whether seizures had or had not occurred). In 16 papers, describing at least 2101 electrode placements in 1555 patients, seizures were described in 42 patients (incidence 2.7%). The range of seizure incidence varied from 0% (three series encompassing 317 patients and 576 electrode placements) up to 10% (n = 130) and 13% (n = 15). The reasons for this variance were not obvious. At least 74% of seizures occurred around the time of electrode implantation and many of these patients also suffered intracranial hemorrhage. Follow up times were variable (range 6 mths to 5 years). The analysis was complicated by multiple publications from some centres with duplication of some data. The quality of literature on seizures following DBS insertion for neuromodulation is highly variable. Analysis of the available data, after making corrections for publication of duplicate data, suggests strongly that the risk of seizures associated with DBS placement is probably lower than 2.4% (95% CI 1.7 to 3.3 %).

It corresponds to the perception of an internal noise that can severely impair the quality of life. Tinnitus management requires a multidisciplinary approach in which neuromodulation and neurosurgery tend to play major roles. Classification of tinnitus separates objective tinnitus (i.e., tinnitus that can be heard or recorded) from the more frequent subjective tinnitus (i.e., tinnitus only perceived by the patient). Objective tinnitus is either pulsatile synchronous with heartbeat or asynchronous. In the former, appropriate radiological testing should search for a vascular abnormality as well as other neurological diseases (intracranial hypertension, Arnold-Chiari malformation, vascular loops, etc.). Asynchronous objective tinnitus generally corresponds to muscular contractions that require specific management. The pathophysiology of subjective tinnitus is more complex, showing strong analogies with postamputation pain syndromes. After peripheral middle ear or inner ear damage, auditory deafferentation could result in hyperactivity and/or functional reorganization within central auditory and nonauditory structures. This could explain the persistence of tinnitus after total hearing amputation (e.g., translabyrinthine approach for vestibular schwannoma) and associated symptoms such as hyperacusis or anxiety and depression. This central model finds strong support in animal experiments and in functional neuroimagery (PET, fMRI, MEG). Since no etiologically based therapies are currently available, severe subjective tinnitus management only targets tinnitus tolerance with sound enrichment or cognitive behavior therapy.

However, bilateral ATN lesioning decreased glucose uptake only in the target region. Animals with bilateral ATN lesions showed no metabolic changes after ATN stimulation. Thus, bilateral DBS of the ATN reversibly induces metabolic activation of the target area and modulates energy metabolism in remote brain regions via efferent or afferent fibers in non-epileptic rats.

So far, evidence is based on a limited number of cases with spontaneously recorded seizures or in whom electrical stimulation of invasive intracranial EEG recordings has been performed. We report a patient who suffered from epigastric psychic auras, complex partial seizures with a gelastic component and secondarily generalized seizures. To evaluate a possible epileptogenic role of the hippocampus and dysplastic region in the right mid-temporal gyrus, intracranial monitoring with subdural electrodes over the temporobasal and temporolateral regions, as well as a deep brain electrode in the hippocampus, were performed. During the intial part of the seizure, consisting of an intense retrosternal ascending feeling with sexual connotation, rhythmic spikes in temporolateral contacts were detected. Concomitant with the development of smiling and laughter, a rhythmic activity over the temporobasal regions evolved. The patient became seizure-free following right temporal lobe resection. This case supports the assumption that ictal involvement of temporobasal structures is crucial for gelastic seizure components in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) and the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMN) may alleviate dystonia and neuropathic pain, respectively. A noninvasive alternative to DBS is radiosurgical ablation [internal pallidotomy (IP) and medial thalamotomy (MT)]. The main technical limitation of radiosurgery is that targets are selected only on the basis of MRI anatomy, without electrophysiological confirmation. This means that, to be feasible, image-based targeting must be highly accurate and reproducible. Here, we report on the feasibility of an atlas-based approach to targeting for functional radiosurgery. In this method, masks of the GPi, CMN, and medio-dorsal nucleus were nonrigidly registered to patients' T1-weighted MRI (T1w-MRI) and superimposed on patients' T2-weighted MRI (T2w-MRI). Radiosurgical targets were identified on the T2w-MRI registered to the planning CT by an expert functional neurosurgeon. To assess its feasibility, two patients were treated with the CyberKnife using this method of targeting; a patient with dystonia received an IP (120 Gy prescribed to the 65% isodose) and a patient with neuropathic pain received a MT (120 Gy to the 77% isodose). Six months after treatment, T2w-MRIs and contrast-enhanced T1w-MRIs showed edematous regions around the lesions; target placements were reevaluated by DW-MRIs. At 12 months post-treatment steroids for radiation-induced edema and medications for dystonia and neuropathic pain were suppressed. Both patients experienced significant relief from pain and dystonia-related problems. Fifteen months after treatment edema had disappeared.

Here we demonstrate an oscillatory activity with similar spectral characteristics and motor reactivity in the human thalamus. Depth signals were recorded in 29 patients in whom the ventral intermediate or centromedian nucleus were surgically targeted for deep brain stimulation. Thirteen patients with four different pathologies showed sharply tuned activity centred at approximately 70 Hz in spectra of thalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings. This activity was modulated by movement and, critically, varied over the sleep-wake cycle, being suppressed during slow wave sleep and re-emergent during rapid eye movement sleep, which physiologically bears strong similarities with the waking state. It was enhanced by startle-eliciting stimuli, also consistent with modulation by arousal state. The link between this pattern of thalamic activity and that of similar frequency in the basal ganglia was strengthened by the finding that fast thalamic oscillations were lost in untreated parkinsonian patients, paralleling the behaviour of this activity in the basal ganglia. Furthermore, there was sharply tuned coherence between thalamic and pallidal LFP activity at approximately 70 Hz in eight out of the 11 patients in whom globus pallidus and thalamus were simultaneously implanted.

We present a novel data visualization algorithm and several unique features that address these shortcomings. The algorithm extracts multiple computational features from the microelectrode neurophysiology and integrates them with tools from unsupervised machine learning. The resulting colour-coded map of neural activity reveals activity transitions that correspond to the anatomic boundaries of subcortical structures. Using these maps, a non-neurophysiologist is able to achieve sensitivities of 90% and 95% for STN entry and exit, respectively, to within 0.5 mm accuracy of the current gold standard.

A comparison of in vivo and high resolution ex vivo connectivity patterns was performed as a measure of the utility of in vivo DT in presurgical planning for DBS. Diagnostic measures included neuropsychological testing, preoperative and ex vivo DT, and macroscopic neuropathological assessment. Post-DBS depression rating scores did not improve. In vivo and ex vivo DT revealed markedly reduced limbic projections from the thalamus and SACC to the amygdala in the right (stroke-affected) hemisphere. A highly selective right mediothalamic lesion was associated with the onset of refractory depression. Reduced amygdalar-thalamic and amygdalar-SACC connections could be a contraindication to DBS for depression. Correspondence between preoperative and higher resolution ex vivo DT supports the validity of DT as a presurgical planning tool for DBS.", "pages": "438-42"}, {"volume": "38", "title": "[Deep brain stimulation, Parkinson's disease and neuropsychiatric complications].", "issue": "9", "pmid": "19299587", "authors": ["Jaafari, N", "Gir\u00e9, P", "Houeto, JL"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Presse m\u00e9dicale (Paris, France : 1983)", "abstract": "Endocannabinoids (ECs) act as retrograde messengers that enable postsynaptic cells to regulate the strength of their synaptic inputs. Here, by using physiological and histological techniques, we showed that, unlike in other parts of the brain, excitatory inputs are more sensitive than inhibitory inputs to EC signaling in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), an auditory brainstem nucleus. The principal cells of the DCN, fusiform cells, integrate acoustic signals through nonplastic synapses located in the deep layer with multimodal sensory signals carried by plastic parallel fibers in the molecular layer. Parallel fibers contact fusiform cells and inhibitory interneurons, the cartwheel cells, which in turn inhibit fusiform cells. Postsynaptic depolarization or pairing of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) with action potentials (APs) induced EC-mediated modulation of excitatory inputs but did not affect inhibitory inputs. Quantitative electron microscopical studies showed that glutamatergic terminals express more cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) than glycinergic terminals. Fusiform and cartwheel cells express diacylglycerol lipase alpha and beta (DGLalpha/beta), the two enzymes involved in the generation of the EC, 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). DGLalpha and DGLbeta are found in the spines of cartwheel but not fusiform cells indicating that the synthesis of ECs is more distant from parallel fiber synapses in fusiform than cartwheel cells. The differential localization and density of DGLalpha/beta and CB1Rs leads to cell- and input-specific EC signaling that favors activity-dependent EC-mediated suppression at synapses between parallel fibers and cartwheel cell spines, thus leading to reduced feedforward inhibition in fusiform cells. We propose that EC signaling is a major modulator of the balance of excitation and inhibition in auditory circuits.", "pages": "438-42"}, {"volume": "217", "title": "Enhanced synchronization of thalamic theta band local field potentials in patients with essential tremor.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "19299231", "authors": ["Kane, A", "Hutchison, WD", "Hodaie, M", "Lozano, AM", "Dostrovsky, JO"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "The use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to control severely disabling neurological and psychiatric conditions is an exciting and fast emerging area of neuroscience.

Actually, a variety of invasive and noninvasive techniques of cortical stimulation could serve therapeutic purpose, including ECS, rTMS, but also transcranial electrical stimulation using pulsed currents (TCES) or direct currents (tDCS). This review presents the methods of therapeutic cortical stimulation that are currently applicable and some of their principles. In particular, it must be emphasized that the site(s) of action can be distant from the site of stimulation because axons with remote projections are more prone to be activated than local cell bodies. Hence, cortical stimulation may activate, inhibit or otherwise interfere with the activity of various cortico-subcortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity, current polarity, and the configuration of the induced electric field. Functional and clinical effects occur during or beyond the time of stimulation. The existence of after-effects relates to processes of synaptic plasticity induced by the stimulation.

Although levodopa continues as the gold standard for efficacy, its chronic use is associated with potentially disabling motor complications. Current evidence suggests that these are related to mode of administration, whereby multiple oral doses of levodopa generate pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors. Current dopamine agonists, while producing more constant plasma levels, fail to match levodopa's efficacy. Strategies to treat levodopa-related motor complications are only partially effective, rarely abolishing motor fluctuations or dyskinesias. Best results are currently achieved with invasive strategies via subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraduodenal delivery of apomorphine or levodopa, or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.

Targeting transmitter systems beyond the dopamine system is an interesting approach, both for the motor and nonmotor problems of PD.

It is part of the study guide on stroke and neurodegenerative disorders in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This focused review emphasizes treatment of locomotion deficits, upper limb motor control deficits, and hypokinetic dysarthria. New dopaminergic agents and deep brain stimulation are facilitating longer periods of functional stability for patients with PD. Adjunctive exercise-based treatments can therefore be applied over longer periods of time to optimize function before inevitable decline from this neurodegenerative disease. As function deteriorates in patients with PD, the role of caregivers becomes more critical, thus training caregivers is of paramount importance to help maintain a safe environment and limit caregiver anxiety and depression. The overall goal of this article is to enhance the learner's existing practice techniques used to treat PD through exercise-based intervention methods.", "pages": "438-42"}, {"volume": "87", "title": "Induction of bradykinesia with pallidal deep brain stimulation in patients with cranial-cervical dystonia.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "17962524", "authors": ["Berman, BD", "Starr, PA", "Marks, WJ", "Ostrem, JL"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease as well as a dynamical disease. Its symptoms can be alleviated by high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS), which has become standard therapeutic strategy for about two decades. Today, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the preferred target for DBS in PD. The physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of this procedure are still far from clear, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the effect of DBS. However, no consensus has yet been reached. In this review paper, existing interpretations of DBS effects during STN stimulation in PD are examined. Based on results of a population-based computational model, we argue that the alleviation of PD symptoms originates in the functional decoupling of neurons in the stimulated area. This mechanism, which we call stimulation-induced functional decoupling (SIFD), is then tested against various observations, paradoxes, and modeling results. Finally, we suggest that current hypotheses indeed reflect various facets of SIFD and the resonant properties of STN neurons. This review is the first to propose an explanation of the effects of DBS by integrating and building bridges across several levels of description, including synapses, neuron population, and population network.", "pages": "438-42"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Dopamine dysregulation syndrome: an overview of its epidemiology, mechanisms and management.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10598706", "authors": ["O'Sullivan, SS", "Evans, AH", "Lees, AJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "CNS drugs", "abstract": "We investigate the clinical outcome from stimulation of the mamillothalamic tract in two patients with intractable epilepsy secondary to hypothalamic hamartomas.
