Using chronic recording techniques, electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from multiple sites of each muscle during treadmill locomotion, ear scratch, and paw shake. Standard histochemical analysis was performed on each muscle to determine fiber-type distribution. The histochemically regionalized muscles (ST and TA) were differentially active during slow locomotion; the deep regions (high in type I [SO] fibers) were active, but the superficial regions (high in type IIB [FG] fibers) were inactive. Vigorous movements (fast locomotion, ear scratch, paw shake) produced additional, synchronous activation of the superficial regions. In all movements, ST and TA activation patterns were consistent with the existence of identically timed synaptic inputs to all motoneurons within each motoneuron pool, resulting in an orderly recruitment of each whole pool. The differential activation recorded from ST and TA during slow locomotion was presumably a consequence of the non-uniform distribution of the different muscle fiber types. In contrast, differential activation of the histochemically nonregionalized, mechanically heterogeneous muscles (BF and TFL) resulted from non-synchronous activation of different muscle regions. The selective activation of BF or TFL compartments was indicative of differential synaptic inputs to, and selective recruitment of, subpopulations of the motoneuron pool, with each motoneuron subpopulation exclusively innervating physically separate regions of the muscle consistent with the regions defined by the neuromuscular territories of the major nerve branches supplying each muscle. Individual neuromuscular compartments of BF and TFL differ in their mechanical arrangements to the skeleton and in their contribution to mechanical action(s) at the hip and knee joints. Selective neural activation of mechanically distinct compartments within a mechanically heterogeneous muscle can provide highly advantageous mechanical \"options\" for animals that perform kinematically diverse movements. With regard to EMG recording techniques, the results of this study emphasize the need for carefully chosen EMG sampling sites and the value of knowing the muscle histochemistry, neuromuscular and musculoskeletal anatomy and possible mechanical functions prior to recording EMG.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "113", "title": "Image-directed functional neurosurgery with the Cosman-Roberts-Wells stereotactic instrument.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "1799161", "authors": ["Mart\u00ednez, R", "Vaquero, J"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "abstract": "An isocentered system for functional stereotactic procedures with the Cosman-Roberts-Wells frame and a CT localizer that allows extrapolation of target data directly from the CT slice is presented.

By pressing the anterior palatal surfaces sustained jaw opening was elicited, suggesting that sustained jaw opening results from inhibition of tonic background activity of jaw-closing motoneurons by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) elicited by mechanical stimulation of the anterior palatal mucosa. Recordings showed that the onset of IPSPs was 80 ms earlier than the onset of jaw opening. Application of diffuse pressure stimulation to the posterior palatal surfaces elicited bursts of spikes triggered on excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), suggesting that mechanosensory receptors from the posterior palatal mucosa send excitatory synaptic inputs to jaw-closing motoneurons. Furthermore, it is suggested that mechanosensory inputs from the posterior palatal mucosa may excite neurons in the central pattern generator and provide the motor patterns responsible for jaw closure during the jaw-closing reflex. We have demonstrated that excitation of Mass. Mns innervating the deep masseter muscle mainly contributed to maintaining the occlusal phase of jaw closure during the jaw-closing reflex. However, the onset of EPSPs was 100 to 160 ms (n = 27) earlier than the onset of jaw closure.

Supplement", "abstract": "It is suggested that transcranial electric stimulation can activate pyramidal tract projections both directly and indirectly in a manner similar to that described after direct stimulation of the exposed cortex in the monkey. This produces both D- and I-waves in the pyramidal tract. At high intensities of stimulation, the stimulus can spread into the brain and activate pyramidal tract axons several centimeters below the cortical surface. Magnetic stimulation at moderate intensities produces electromyographic (EMG) responses with latencies 1-2 msec longer than those after electric stimulation. Two possible explanations have been put forward to account for this effect: (1) because of the difference in the direction of electric current flow induced in the brain by the 2 forms of stimulation, magnetic stimulation preferentially excites pyramidal tract cells indirectly, and hence evokes only I-waves in the pyramidal tract. (2) Electric stimulation (even at threshold) activates pyramidal axons deep in the white matter, whereas magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal cells in the gray matter, probably at their initial segment. There is one interesting consequence common to both explanations. Whether magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically or at their initial segment, the size of the descending volley evoked will depend on the level of excitability of the motor cortex. In contrast, the response to electric stimulation will be less affected, since a proportion of the descending volley is initiated directly at the axon of the pyramidal cell. This differential effect of cortical excitability on the responses to electrical and magnetic stimulation can be useful in describing excitatory or inhibitory influences on motor cortex from other structures.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "Intrinsic inter- and intralaminar connections and their relationship to the tonotopic map in cat primary auditory cortex.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "1761089", "authors": ["Wallace, MN", "Kitzes, LM", "Jones, EG"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Injections in layer I labeled two types of morphologically distinct fibers in layer I as well as a smaller number of axons in layers II and III. Layer II injections labeled descending axons that produced a dense plexus of terminal fibers in layers I-III of both AI and adjacent auditory fields. Injections in layer III also labeled a dense plexus of axon collaterals at the junction of layers V and VI and labeled patches of terminal fibers in both AI and adjacent auditory fields. These were densest in layers I-III but usually extended into layers IV and V as well. The patches were partly formed by axon collaterals of layer III pyramidal cells that traveled for over 4 mm in the gray matter. Injections confined to layer IV labeled axons in all layers of the cortex but none of these axons appeared to reach the white matter. The axons spread laterally in layer IV and up into the superficial layers and ramified especially layer I. Injections in layers V and VI labeled axons in all layers' of the cortex but these were densest in the deep layers where labeling was fairly homogeneous. In the upper layers the labeling was arranged in semi-discrete patches. Large injections involving layers I-III were studied in tangential sections. Between 3 and 8 patches of terminal labeling were observed in AI and these were mainly arranged in a band with its long axis aligned approximately in the dorsoventral direction. However dense patches of terminal labeling also occurred both anterior and posterior to the injection site. In selected experiments portions of the tonotopic map in AI were mapped by single unit recording and subsequently the map was related to patches of anterogradely labeled fibers that surrounded injections of PHA-L. Rows of dorsoventrally oriented patches were among cells with a similar best frequency to those in the injection site. However patches located anterior or posterior to the injection site were among cells with higher or lower best frequencies. Two injections of PHA-L close together produce different patterns of labeling. One of the injections usually produces one or more patches that has no correlate among the patches of fibers labeled by the adjacent injection. This is clearest when one of the injections is made with biotinylated PHA-L that can be visualized directly without the use of primary antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "86", "title": "Auditory corticocortical interconnections in the cat: evidence for parallel and hierarchical arrangement of the auditory cortical areas.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "1722171", "authors": ["Rouiller, EM", "Simm, GM", "Villa, AE", "de Ribaupierre, Y", "de Ribaupierre, F"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The transcallosal projections to AAF, AI, PAF and AII were principally homotypic since the major source of input was their corresponding area in the contralateral cortex. Heterotypic transcallosal projections to AAF and AI were seen, originating from the contralateral AI and AAF, respectively. PAF received heterotypic commissural projections from the opposite ventroposterior auditory cortical field (VPAF). Heterotypic callosal inputs to AII were rare, originating from AAF and AI. The neurons of origin of the transcallosal connections were located mainly in layers II and III (70-92%), and less frequently in deep layers (V and VI, 8-30%). Single unit recordings provided evidence that both homotypic and heterotypic transcallosal projections connect corresponding frequency regions of the two hemispheres. The regional distribution of the anterogradely labeled terminals indicated that the homotypic and heterotypic auditory transcallosal projections are reciprocal. The present data suggest that the transcallosal auditory interconnections are segregated in 3 major parallel components (AAF-AI, PAF-VPAF and AII), maintaining a segregation between parallel functional channels already established for the thalamocortical auditory interconnections. For the intrahemispheric connections, the analysis of the retrograde tracing data revealed that AAF and AI receive projections from the homolateral cortical areas PAF, VPAF and AII, whose neurons of origin were located mainly in their deep (V and VI) cortical layers. The reciprocal interconnections between the homolateral AAF and AI did not show a preferential laminar arrangement since the neurons of origin were distributed almost evenly in both superficial (II and III) and deep (V and VI) cortical layers. On the contrary, PAF received inputs from the homolateral cortical fields AAF, AI, AII and VPAF, originating predominantly from their superficial (II and III) layers. The homolateral projections reaching AII originated mainly from the superficial layers of AAF and AI, but from the deep layers of VPAF and PAF. The laminar distribution of anterogradely labeled terminal fields, when they were dense enough for a confident identification, was systematically related to the laminar arrangement of neurons of origin of the reciprocal projection: a projection originating from deep layers was associated with a reciprocal projection terminating mainly in layer IV, whereas a projection originating from superficial layers was associated with a reciprocal projection terminating predominantly outside layer IV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "84", "title": "Morphological characterization of rat entorhinal neurons in vivo: soma-dendritic structure and axonal domains.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "1713171", "authors": ["Lingenh\u00f6hl, K", "Finch, DM"], "year": "1991", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

The dendrites of layer II neurons were largely restricted to layers I and II or layers I-III, while the dendrites of deeper cells could extend through all cortical layers. Computed 3D rotations showed that the basilar dendrites of deep pyramids extended roughly parallel to the cortical layering, and that they were mostly confined to the layer containing the soma and layers immediately adjacent. Total dendritic lengths averaged 9.8 mm +/- 3.8 (SD), and ranged from 5 mm to more than 18 mm. Axonal processes could be visualized in 21 cells. Most of these showed axonal branching within the entorhinal cortex, sometimes extensive. Efferent axonal domains were reconstructed in detail in 3 layer II stellate cells. All 3 projected axons across the subicular complex to the dentate gyrus. One of these cells showed an extensive net-like axonal domain that also projected to several other structures, including the hippocampus proper, subicular complex, and the amygdalo-piriform transition area. The axons of layer III and IV cells projected to the angular bundle, where they continued in a rostral direction. In contrast to the layer II, III and IV cells, no efferent axonal branches leaving the entorhinal cortex could be visualized in 5 layer V neurons. The data indicate that entorhinal neurons can integrate input from a considerable volume of entorhinal cortex by virtue of their extensive dendritic domains, and provide a further basis for specifying the layers in which cells receive synaptic input.

The characteristics of the brain activity in these patients were evaluated from the late positive component of the cerebral evoked potential in response to painful stimuli (pain-related P250). While any neurological scoring system for the comatose state includes evaluations of motor reactions to painful stimuli, the pain-related P250 is unique in terms of its ability to assess the cortical responsiveness to painful stimuli directly and quantitatively without involving functions of the motor system. It was found that the pain-related P250 was more or less depressed in patients in a PVS. It was repeatedly demonstrated in four patients, however, that the pain-related P250 could be transiently increased by preceding stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Furthermore, a persistent increase in the pain-related P250 was produced in these four patients following chronic DBS of the mesencephalic reticular formation or nonspecific thalamic nuclei for more than 6 months, and this was correlated with the clinical improvements.

Spinoreticular tract (SRT) neurons (n = 33) were categorized into three types (\"deep-inhibited,\" \"deep-complex,\" and \"intermediate\") on the basis of their locations and of their responses to natural and electrical stimulation. 3. The deep-inhibited-type neurons, located in the medial part of the deeper laminae (approximately VI-VIII), comprised a large component of the sample (20/33). They had no demonstrable excitatory receptive field (RF). However, electrical stimulation of low-threshold cutaneous afferents of hindlimb nerves evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) via an oligosynaptic linkage. High-threshold cutaneous and muscle afferents also evoked IPSPs. 4. In the deep-complex-type neurons (8/33), electrical stimulation of low-threshold cutaneous afferents evoked complex IPSP-excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) sequences. With intense stimuli, long-latency C-fiber-like EPSPs were evoked. Two of these eight neurons were characterized as wide-dynamic-range (WDR) neurons with large, excitatory and inhibitory cutaneous RFs. 5. Intermediate-type neurons (5/33) were concentrated in the lateral spinal gray and relatively superficially (approximately lamina V). These neurons had convergent low- and high-threshold cutaneous inputs (WDR neurons). Electrical stimulation of low-threshold cutaneous afferent fibers from within the excitatory RF evoked mono- or disynaptic EPSPs followed by IPSPs. High-threshold muscle and cutaneous afferents also evoked EPSPs. 6. These results show that SRT neurons have a variety of response characteristics resulting from various degrees of spatial and temporal summation of primary afferent input.

Consistent with earlier findings, zimeldine gave a biphasic effect on sleep and waking. Waking was increased the first 3 h, followed by an increase in deep slow wave sleep (SWS-2), maximal in hours 4 and 5. Ritanserin gave an increase in SWS-2 that was spread out over the recording period. Ritanserin + zimeldine also gave a biphasic effect as zimeldine did, and the initial increase in waking and the following increase in SWS-2 tended to be stronger. Thus, ritanserin did not block the initial waking effect seen after zimeldine administration, indicating that this waking effect was not due to 5-HT2 stimulation. The increase in SWS-2 seemed to reflect an addition of the increases following the zimeldine and ritanserin alone conditions.

The present results suggest a relatively secure transmission of joint afferent traffic to perceptual levels, and it is concluded that the human brain may be able to synthesize meaningful information on joint displacement on the basis of impulses in a single joint afferent. This could partly compensate for the low responsiveness of individual joint afferents within the physiological range of joint displacements. Although single muscle spindle afferents can adequately encode joint position and movement, the results suggest that the brain needs the information from more than one muscle spindle afferent to perceive changes in joint angle.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "523", "title": "Somatosensory neurons projecting from the superior colliculus to the intralaminar thalamus in the rat.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "7234450", "authors": ["Yamasaki, DS", "Krauthamer, GM"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Neurons of the rat superior colliculus projecting to the intralaminar thalamus were tested for their responses to somatosensory stimulation.

A novel fluorescence detection method was developed and employed with biotinylated oligonucleotides to permit the rapid, sensitive visualization of in situ hybridization. The hybridization was temperature-sensitive, eliminated by ribonuclease, and co-localized in neurotensin-immunoreactive perikarya in the midbrain. In the forebrain of control rats, proneurotensin mRNA-containing neurons were found in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral caudate/putamen, in the nucleus accumbens, in the ventral striatum including the olfactory tubercles, and in the septal nuclei. Haloperidol induced significant increases in the frequencies and distributions of hybridization-positive neurons in the striatum and septal nuclei. In the midbrain, the highest frequency of hybridization-positive neurons occurred in the substantia nigra and the superior colliculus. Prominent populations were also present in the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray, the oculomotor region, and the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Less prominent were populations of neurons in the dorsomedial deep mesencephalic nuclei and the ventral tegmental area. Haloperidol induced only modest increases in the frequency of pro-neurotensin mRNA-containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and had no effects elsewhere in the midbrain. These results show that the fluorescent detection techniques used in this analysis provide a very rapid, reliable method for localizing hybridized mRNA in the rat brain. This study also suggests that a subpopulation of striatal neurons begin to express proneurotensin mRNA in response to haloperidol treatment. This effect of haloperidol on striatal neurons contrasts with results from additional studies of enkephalin mRNA in the striatum, suggesting that the mechanisms of haloperidol stimulation may differ between neurotensin and enkephalin-containing neurons.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "293", "title": "Supplementary eye field as defined by intracortical microstimulation: connections in macaques.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "1274638", "authors": ["Huerta, MF", "Kaas, JH"], "year": "1990", "journal": "The Journal of comparative neurology", "abstract": "In macaques, the frontal eye field and the recently defined supplementary eye field play a role in the production of eye movements.

The electrodes were implanted in the primary somatosensory cortex, cortical somatosensory radiation, medial lemniscus and midbrain reticular formation. Alterations in the excitability of the primary sensory pathway were assessed by the changes of the input to and output from these brain areas: the response in the medial lemniscus to the stimulation of the skin represented the input to the thalamic relay nucleus and the response recorded in the cortical sensory radiation represented the output from the thalamic relay nucleus. The concentrations of nitrous oxide studied were 50% and 75% in oxygen, and the drug effect was concentration-related. The cortical response to peripheral stimulation was suppressed in amplitude by more than 40% of the control with 75% nitrous oxide, and the response in the cortical radiation was suppressed by 20% of the control with the same dose of nitrous oxide. The response in the cortical radiation to stimulation of the medial lemniscus was suppressed by 20% of the control and the postsynaptic component of the cortical response to the stimulation of the medial lemniscus was suppressed by more than 50% of the control. The multi-unit activity of the brainstem reticular formation was enhanced by nitrous oxide in a dose related manner. The excitability of the thalamic relay nucleus and the primary somatosensory cortex was suppressed by natural slow wave sleep when the reticular multi-unit activity was suppressed, and they were enhanced by paradoxical phase of sleep when the reticular multi-unit activity was enhanced. These findings indicated that the degree of suppression of excitability by nitrous oxide is similar in both the thalamic relay nucleus and sensory cortex, and its action on the brain stem reticular formation is different from that on the primary sensory system.

Cells which were insensitive to motion of visual noise per se or weakly responsive to individual 'grains' in the noise sample showed suppression of bar-evoked responses by simultaneous motion of the noise background. Percent suppression declined with increase in bar length, over a range which could exceed the maximum estimate of receptive field length. The decline in percent suppression was non-linear, becoming progressively flatter in slope as bar length was increased until an asymptotic value was reached; observations on end-stopped cells and on end-free cells with restricted length summation verified that percent suppression was related specifically to the length of the comparison bar and not to the strength of response it evoked. Percent suppression and the extent over which it declined with increase in bar length were comparable for preferred and opposite directions of bar motion even in cells with radically different length-response functions in the two directions, including end-stopped cells with direction-selective end-zones. In contrast to end-inhibition, which was maximal at or near the preferred velocity for a bar of optimal length, percent suppression by motion of the noise background was essentially velocity-invariant; in velocity tuned and velocity high-pass cells, background motion reduced the slope(s) of the velocity-response function, implying that the suppressive action of moving noise backgrounds is divisive rather than subtractive.

These labeled cells were located primarily in lamina V, VII, VIII and X. Locations of labeled cells following FG deposition at ineffective MRF sites were similar. However, there was a striking difference in the number of cells retrogradely labeled from the effective MRF sites compared to ineffective MRF sites. Significantly greater numbers of labeled cells were observed in the contralateral MRF, the midbrain, and the cervical spinal cord from the FG deposition at effective stimulation sites. These results suggest that one characteristic of MRF sites that activate epaxial muscles is a larger amount of afferent input, from the midbrain central gray and from contralateral Gi, compared to ineffective MRF sites. Ascending and descending inputs converge at the effective MRF sites, and the larger number of descending projections suggests a more powerful contribution of these afferents to deep lumbar back muscle activation.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "The decomposition of the middle latency auditory evoked potential (MLAEP) Pa component into superficial and deep source contributions.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "4075081", "authors": ["Jacobson, GP", "Newman, CW"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Brain topography", "abstract": "The results of recent investigations have suggested that the Middle Latency Auditory Evoked Potential (MLAEP) Pa component derives its physiological origins from both cortical and subcortical sources.

This technique is sensitive to current activity that is generated in the superficial cerebral cortex. These SD maps of the MLAEP were subsequently subtracted from the CAR maps of the MLAEP. The derived CAR-SD maps are believed to represent that activity that is generated deep to the cerebral cortex (Hjorth and Rodin 1988).

Axon terminals in the motor cortex belonging to CC afferents were labeled by degeneration induced by lesions of the somatosensory cortex; neurons in the motor cortex were labeled by the Golgi/EM method. In each cat, data from the motor cortex (MCx) contralateral (experimental) and ipsilateral (control) to the cerebellar lesion were compared. Cerebellar lesions produced marked motor deficits, which receded gradually and disappeared after 30 to 40 days. Subsequent lesions of the somatosensory cortex (area 2) contralateral to the cerebellar lesions resulted in the reappearance of the cerebellar symptoms. The number of CC synapses per unit area in experimental MCx was significantly higher than in control MCx. The increase in the number of CC synapses was apparent throughout layers II-V of the MCx, but was most prominent in layers II/III. The increase in the number of CC synapses in experimental MCx was due mainly to an increase of axon terminals synapsing with dendritic spines belonging to pyramidal neurons. In comparison, the numbers and spatial distribution of CC synapses with aspinous, nonpyramidal neurons from both experimental and control MCx were similar. Field potentials in the experimental MCx, evoked by stimulation of area 2, were altered following cerebellar lesions. In experimental MCx, the polarity of the early component of the field potentials reversed at cortical depths corresponding to layers II-III, whereas this reversal was not observed in control MCx. These findings suggest that lesions of the cerebellar nuclei induced sprouting of axon terminals in the MCx to establish a new function.

In all experimental groups the majority of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons had high regular or rhythmic burst spontaneous activity, which in half of the neuronal population persisted in conditions of synaptic blockade. The low-frequency irregular activity of the surrounding structures (lateral septum, caudate, accumbens, medial preoptic area) was completely suppressed in these conditions. The density of the spontaneously active neurons in the slices, as well as the mean frequency of discharges in the medial septum-diagonal band complex of hibernating ground squirrels, was significantly higher than that in waking ground squirrels and guinea-pigs. Stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle evoked initial suppression of activity in majority of the medial septum-diagonal band complex units; in many of them the suppression was followed by a burst discharge. The neurons with background rhythmic burst activity always responded by resetting the spontaneous bursts. In total, about 50-60% of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons of waking ground squirrels and guinea-pigs responded by post inhibitory bursts to the stimulation of medial forebrain bundle, while in hibernating ground squirrels such responses were observed in nearly all neurons. The threshold values of the stimulating current were significantly lower in the hibernating ground squirrels' group, the mean duration of the initial suppression was shorter, the intraburst density of spikes and/or duration of the bursts was increased. Thus, evaluation of spontaneous and evoked activity on the basis of various criteria revealed surprising similarity between the two groups of active animals, while the activity and excitability of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons was approximately doubled in the hibernating animals.

AGr, which was cytoarchitectonically subdivided into medial (AGrm) and lateral (AGrl) parts, also can be characterized on a functional basis. AGrl contains the head, forelimb, and most hindlimb representations; only a small number of hindlimb neurons are confined in AGrm. Different distributions of submodalities exist in AGr and Gr: AGr receives predominantly deep input (with the exception of the vibrissa region, which receives cutaneous input), whereas neurons of Gr respond almost exclusively to cutaneous input. The cutaneous or deep receptive field (RF) of each neuron was determined by natural peripheral stimulation. All studied neurons were activated by small RFs, with the exception of lip, nose, pinna, and limb units of lateral Gr (Grl), for which the RFs were larger. Microelectrode mapping experiments revealed the existence of three spatially separate, incomplete body maps in which somatosensory and motor representations overlap. One body map, with limbs medially and head rostrolaterally, is contained in AGr. A second map, comparable to the first somatosensory cortex (SI) of other mammals, is found in Gr, with hindlimb, trunk, forelimb, and head representations in an orderly mediolateral sequence. An unresponsive zone separates the head area from the forelimb region. A third map, with the forelimb rostrally and the hindlimb caudally, lies adjacent and lateral to the SI head area. This limb representation, which is characterized by an upright and small size compared to that found in SI, can be considered to be part of the second somatosensory cortex (SII). A distinct head representation was not recognized as properly belonging to SII, but the evidence that neurons of the SI head region respond to stimulation of large RFs located in lips, nose, and pinna leads us to hypothesize that the SII face area overlaps that of SI to some extent, or, alternatively, that the two areas strictly contiguous and the limits are ambiguous, making them difficult to distinguish.

A single shock applied to the area dorsalis centralis (Dc) of the telencephalon, and only to this area, elicits a sequence of deflections in the ipsilateral optic tectum: an initial negative peak at about 8 ms, (= N8), a larger N25 and a slow P50-N95. The configurations, depth profiles, latencies and susceptibility to repetitive stimulation, together with the known tectal anatomy, suggest that the first wave is due to the afferent fibers from the telencephalon and that N25 is due to deep tectal neurons. Telencephalic input exerts a conditioning effect on the field potentials and unit responses evoked by direct optic nerve shock. Such a shock elicits, in the contralateral tectum, small negative, optic tract axon peaks followed by a large N6, believed to be postsynaptic, and a still later P12. As a first approximation it is argued that the telencephalic input and the retinal input are activating different sets of neuronal elements in the optic tectum, since the configuration and depth profile of the telencephalic and optic nerve shock-elicited potentials are different. A conditioning Dc stimulus has a long-lasting effect on the form of the optic nerve field potential, maximally when the pallial shock precedes the optic by about 90 ms. The effect, observed by subtracting the conditioned from the unconditioned tectal response to optic nerve shock, is a difference wave with N11 and P20. The unit activity from deep tectal laminae is either activated or accelerated following Dc stimulation, while superficially located neurons are not affected. In another group of tectal units, the optic nerve shock-induced response is depressed by a preceding pallial dorsalis centralis stimulus. The evidence is compatible with the assumption of direct projections from Dc to the deep layers of the tectum, but the timing could also permit indirect pathways.

Of 15 heavily labeled cells located within oralis, 4 were local-circuit neurons with receptive fields restricted to either an incisor, guard hairs, one vibrissa, or deep facial tissue (nociceptors). Their morphologies were highly varied, with expansive and spiny dendritic trees and recurrent and intersubnuclear axon collaterals. Oralis local-circuit neurons therefore most closely resembled non-vibrissa-sensitive local-circuit cells in adjacent subnucleus interpolaris. Six other stained cells projected to contralateral thalamus, and two others projected to ipsilateral cerebellum. They typically had intramodality convergent receptive fields (i.e., spanning more than one receptor organ, such as multiple vibrissae or teeth) with widespread dendritic trees, and were therefore indistinguishable from similarly projecting cells in interpolaris. Two other cells projected to the ipsilateral spinal cord, as well as other V brainstem subnuclei. One of these responded to high-threshold mechanical stimulation of teeth; the other was discharged by deflection of one mystacial vibrissa. Their dendrites were very widespread and ended in spiny and bulbous appendages. Local axon collaterals were also extensive. The remaining oralis cell had two axons, one projecting to the thalamus, the other to the spinal cord. Its receptive field expressed convergence from multiple receptor organs, including vibrissae, guard hairs, and skin. Its somadendritic morphology was similar to that of oralis cells projecting only to thalamus. We conclude that, with some exceptions, the extensive dendritic trees, axon branching, convergence, and functional diversity of oralis cells approximate those described previously for functionally equivalent neurons in interpolaris (Jacquin et al., 1989a,b). Such anatomical and physiological properties are rarely seen, however, in nucleus principalis (Jacquin et al., 1988a).

Two kinds of units are distinguished on physiological criteria, identified as Purkinje and eurydendroid cells (the efferent neurons of the cerebellum in teleosts equivalent to cells of the deep nuclei in other vertebrates). A high proportion of both kinds of units in the corpus cerebelli are sensitive to such stimulation. Each kind of unit shows several consistent response types. Purkinje cells fire simple spikes spontaneously at the rate of 8-50 spikes/s and respond to a single shock to Dc with an initial latency of 34-64 ms. The response can be one of the following types: (1) inhibition alone, with a duration of 0.3-1.5 s; (2) initial inhibition for 0.04-0.2 s, followed by postinhibitory rebound, or (3) initial excitation followed by inhibition which may or may not be followed by a late excitation. It is suggested that the initial excitation and the initial inhibition reflect the activation of mossy fiber-granule cell-Purkinje cell circuitry and mossy fiber-granule cell-inhibitory interneuron-Purkinje cell circuitry, respectively. Indirect evidence suggests the involvement of climbing fibers, but their characteristic complex spikes are rarely seen. Changing the stimulation sites within Dc does not appear to change the response pattern but may alter the threshold intensities, latencies and amplitudes. Changing stimulation frequency has complex effects depending on the response type. Purkinje cells responding with initial excitation are located along the lateral edges and along the midline of the corpus cerebelli; units responding with initial inhibition are more often found in an intermediate zone. This suggests three sagittal bands on each side. The contralateral cerebellum has a relative excess of Purkinje cells with initially inhibitory response. Putative eurydendroid cells show either initial excitation or a pattern of inhibition, excitation, inhibition. The initial latency is longer than in Purkinje cells. The contralateral cerebellum has a relative excess of eurydendroid cells with initially excitatory response. The high proportion of units that respond to Dc stimulation, their complex dynamics, diverse response types and compartmentalization point to the importance of the cerebrocerebellar influence in teleosts.

Important advances in understanding receptive field mechanisms in sensory cortex have arisen from studying the precise relationship between the mystacial vibrissae or \"whiskers\" and their neural representation in separate cortical domains or \"barrels\". The anatomical precision of whisker projections to barrels permits a unique delineation of thalamocortical and intracortical components of cortical cell responses based on latency and security of response to peripheral receptor stimulation. When recorded in awake animals or even under very light anesthesia, cortical neurons show two components to their response to whisker movement. Neurons in layer IV of a whisker's primary projection zone respond with short latency (7-10 msec) and a high response magnitude (two or more action potentials (spikes) per stimulus). This \"Center Receptive Field\" (CRF) for layer IV cells is generated in large part by sensory fiber inputs from the thalamus. The CRF is restricted to 1.4 whiskers on average and is the only response detectable when cortical responses are depressed by deep anesthesia. In the \"waking state\" the same neuron often will respond to deflection of 4-6 surrounding whiskers, but only at longer latency (15-40 msec) and with fewer spikes per stimulus. These more labile responses form an excitatory surround receptive field (SRF). Sensory information that is transduced by individual whiskers and that generates the SRF of a cortical neuron achieves this added response complexity through intracortical mechanisms. The control of the mechanisms that determine the dissemination of sensory information within cortex include: (1) regulating the level of GABAergic inhibition; and (2) potentiation or depression of the response level generated by repeated sensory experience. State-dependent \"modulatory\" inputs to cortex, such as the noradrenergic and cholinergic fiber system, could regulate the degree of horizontal spread of a sensory input, in part through global changes in the level of inhibition and/or regulating the amplitude of cortical responses, thereby determining the level of associative interactions between sensory inputs.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "506", "title": "Differential effects of excitatory amino acid antagonists on dorsal horn nociceptive neurones in the rat.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15815323", "authors": ["Dickenson, AH", "Sullivan, AF"], "year": "1990", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "The effects of two excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists gamma-D-glutamylglycine (DGG) and 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APS), applied onto the spinal cord surface, were tested on the responses of dorsal horn nociceptive neurones in the anaesthetized rat. DGG is a non-selective antagonist at both the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors, whereas AP5 acid is selective for the NMDA receptor. DGG dose-dependently reduced the A and C fibre-evoked responses of neurones in all laminae of the dorsal horn and also inhibited the post-discharges of intermediate and deep neurones resulting from repeated C fibre stimulation. There was little difference in the effects of the antagonist on the intermediate neuronal population compared to superficial or deep cells in the dorsal horn. AP5 has little effect on C fibre-evoked activity in superficial cells but produced slight inhibitions of the C fibre-evoked responses and clear reductions in the post-discharge of the deep neurones. This contrasts with the excitatory effects of the antagonist on both types of responses in the intermediate cells. A fibre-evoked responses were unaffected by AP5. Taking into account the results with the two antagonists it appears that both A and C fibre-evoked responses of dorsal horn nociceptive neurones are mediated by non-NMDA receptors whilst the C fibre-evoked wind-up of deep dorsal horn cells involves the NMDA receptor which also seems to mediate, in a complex manner, C fibre responses of intermediate, presumed substantia gelatinosa neurones.

A total of 193 microelectrode penetrations were made to record single neurons in tracks through the medial and lateral ventroposterior (VPL and VPM), ventrolateral (VL), posterior (Po), and reticular (nRt) thalamic nuclei. Single units were classified according to their (1) location within the nuclei, (2) receptive fields, and (3) response to standardized microstimulation in deep layers of the SI cortical forepaw areas. The SI stimulation produced short-latency (1- to 7-msec) excitatory responses in different percentages of neurons recorded in the following thalamic nuclei: VPL, 42.0%; Po, 25.0%; nRt, 16.4%; VL, 13.6%; and VPM, 9.9%. Within the VPL, the highest proportion of responsive neurons was found in the anterior region. Although most of the VL region was unresponsive, the caudal subregion bordering the rostral VPL showed some responsiveness (13.6% of neurons). In general, the spatial pattern of corticothalamic influences appeared to reciprocate the known thalamocortical connection patterns, but with a heterogeneity that was unpredicted. The same parameters of SI cortical stimulation were used in studies of corticofugal modulation of afferent transmission through the VPL thalamus. A condition-test (C-T) paradigm was implemented in which the cortical stimulation (C) was delivered at a range of time intervals before test (T) mechanical vibratory stimulation was applied to digit 4 of the contralateral forepaw. The time course of cortical effects was analyzed by measuring the averaged evoked unit responses of thalamic neurons to the T stimuli, and plotting them as a function of C-T intervals from 5 to 50 msec. Of the 20 VPL neurons tested during SI stimulation, the average response to T stimulation was decreased a mean of 36%, with the suppression peaking (at 49% inhibition of the afferent response) about 15 msec after the C stimulus. Considerable rostrocaudal variation was observed, however. Whereas neurons in the rostral VPL (near VL) were strongly inhibited (-69%), neurons in the middle and caudal VPL exhibited facilitations at long and short C-T intervals, respectively.

Using EAA receptor and substance P (SP) receptor antagonists and current-clamp, slow excitatory synaptic response evoked by 10-20 Hz stimulation consisted of two depolarizing components: an initial component lasting 1-5 s and a late-one of 1-3 min duration. The initial and late components of the slow excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) can also be distinguished on the basis of their voltage-dependence and sensitivity to Mg2+ ions, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV) and 6-cyano-2,3-dihydroxy-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX). In the presence of Mg2+, the initial component of the slow EPSC increased with membrane hyperpolarization, whereas the late component decreased.

The effects of stimulating A fibres in the dorsal columns on the responses of dorsal horn neurones to intense cutaneous stimuli were studied in the rat anaesthetized with urethane. 2.

Seven of the cells studied projected to the brain via the contralateral anterolateral funiculus. 3. If the discharge of the multireceptive neurones was raised by ionophoretic application of DL-homocysteic acid, a brief period of inhibition lasting for 100-150 ms was seen following a single stimulus to the dorsal columns. Studies were conducted to determine if this brief inhibition could account for the long-lasting inhibition of responses to high-threshold stimuli. 4. Dorsal columns were transected at cervical levels. Stimulation caudal to the transection evoked only the brief excitation and subsequent inhibition for 100-150 ms. No long-lasting inhibition of high-threshold cutaneous afferent input was seen. 5. Stimulation of the dorsal columns rostral to transection did not evoke the brief excitation or inhibition of multireceptive dorsal horn neurones. However, the 4-5 min inhibition of responses to high-threshold cutaneous stimuli was present. 6. The long-lasting inhibition of responses to high-threshold stimuli by dorsal column stimulation was blocked by microinjection of gamma-aminobutyric acid into the anterior pretectal nucleus (APTN) but not by microinjections into adjacent areas of the brain. 7. Ipsilateral lesions of the dorsolateral funiculus at the cervical level also blocked the long-lasting inhibitory effects of dorsal column stimulation. 8. It is concluded that the brief excitation and inhibition of multireceptive dorsal horn neurones is due to antidromic action potentials passing caudally in the dorsal columns to activate spinal segmental mechanisms. The longer-lasting inhibition of responses to high-threshold cutaneous stimuli is due to action potentials ascending in the dorsal columns to activate cells in the APTN which in turn activate a descending inhibition mediated by the dorsolateral funiculus.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "23", "title": "Behavior, episodic secretion of cortisol, and adrenocortical reactivity in bulls subjected to tethering.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "19189718", "authors": ["Ladewig, J", "Smidt, D"], "year": "1989", "journal": "Hormones and behavior", "abstract": "To study the effect of individual housing on behavior and adrenocortical activity, eight bulls were moved to a novel housing environment and subjected to 5 weeks of tethering in individual stanchions with a concrete and partially slatted floor.

Controls using single LED flashes or tone pips or clicks at very long intervals that did not produce apparent motion were also used. We found both visual and auditory units that responded vigorously to the apparent motion stimuli and showed pronounced directional selectivity. However, in the auditory domain such units were rare and thus did not increase the proportion of auditory responses in SC substantially.

Theoretically, the two mechanisms can be differentiated by delivering the stimulation while the eyes are already in motion (colliding saccade paradigm), thereby changing the eye position from which the evoked saccade starts. Only in the first case is the trajectory of the evoked saccade expected to be modified to compensate for part of the ongoing eye movement. An attempt was made to distinguish retinal vs. motor error mechanisms by applying the colliding saccade paradigm of stimulation to 29 sites throughout the superior colliculus (SC) of two trained monkeys. Compensatory evoked saccades, as predicted by the retinal error hypothesis, were obtained consistently in the superficial layers and at deeper sites where visual unit responses could be recorded. Conversely, in deep layers where only presaccadic activity was found, evoked saccades either were not affected by collision or summed their vectors with that of the ongoing movement. These last observations are both consistent with the hypothesis that the signal produced from deep sites was an initial motor error. A second observation was incidentally made: when stimulation was applied to the most superficial SC region, it definitively erased the goal of the ongoing saccade, and the latter did not resume its interrupted course.

The concentration of endogenous noradrenaline was higher in superficial than in deep layers of the superior colliculus. Upon incubation with [3H]noradrenaline, tritium was accumulated by a mechanism that was strongly inhibited by oxaprotiline but little inhibited by 6-nitroquipazine. Electrical stimulation at 0.2 or 3 Hz increased the outflow of tritium from slices preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline; the increase was almost abolished by tetrodotoxin or a low calcium medium. Clonidine reduced the evoked overflow of tritium, whereas yohimbine increased it and antagonized clonidine. The evoked overflow was also reduced by the dopamine D2-receptor-selective agonists apomorphine and quinpirole, an effect antagonized by sulpiride. The preferential opioid kappa-receptor agonist ethylketocyclazocine produced an inhibition that was counteracted by naloxone. Nicotine accelerated the basal outflow of tritium; part of the acceleration was blocked by hexamethonium. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine slightly diminished the electrically evoked overflow, and its effect was abolished by atropine. The oxaprotiline-sensitive uptake of [3H]noradrenaline as well as the tetrodotoxin-sensitive and calcium-dependent overflow of tritium upon electrical stimulation (presumably reflecting the release of [3H]noradrenaline) indicate that noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter in the superior colliculus. The release of [3H]noradrenaline is modulated through alpha 2-adrenoceptors as well as dopamine D2-receptors, opioid kappa-receptors and nicotine and muscarine receptors. No clear evidence was found for modulation through beta-adrenoceptors, D1-receptors, serotonin receptors, opioid mu- or delta-receptors or receptors for GABA or glutamate. Only the alpha 2-adrenoceptors receive an endogenous agonist input, at least under the conditions of these experiments.

Presumably, descending facilitatory influences from the visual cortex to the ipsilateral superior colliculus are counterbalanced by intercollicular inhibition (Sprague: Science 153:1544-1546, '66). However, not all of visual cortex or all of the superior colliculus needs to be involved in this circuit. It is the deep rather than the superficial laminae of the superior colliculus that are primarily involved in visual attentive and orientation behaviors, and these laminae are largely independent of primary visual cortex. However, they do depend on corticotectal influences from a comparatively small extraprimary visual area of the posterior region of the lateral suprasylvian cortex (PSSC-Ogasawara et al: J. Neurophysiol. 52:1226-1245, '84). The present experiments demonstrate that lesions only a few millimeters in diameter in this corticotectal zone of the PSSC can produce profound visual neglect. While damage to this area has little, if any, effect on superficial laminae visual activity, it produces a dramatic decrease in the visual activity of the deep laminae. These cats with PSSC lesions fail to orient to a visual stimulus that is introduced suddenly into the contralateral visual field, yet they respond on nearly 100% of the trials to this same stimulus when it is presented in the ipsilateral visual field. The lesion-induced visual neglect produced by PSSC lesions is long-lasting but can be abruptly ameliorated by a midbrain lesion that primarily involves, or undercuts, the deep laminae of the contralateral superior colliculus. Thus, 1) visual neglect can be produced by depriving the deep laminae of the superior colliculus of visual inputs from the cortex, even when the principal visual cortical regions (17, 18, and 19) and their target structures are intact, and 2) visually guided behavior can be restored by eliminating afferents originating in, or passing through, the deep laminae of the contralateral superior colliculus.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "26", "title": "Afferent signals from cat extraocular muscles in the medial vestibular nucleus, the nucleus praepositus hypoglossi and adjacent brainstem structures.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "2892554", "authors": ["Ashton, JA", "Boddy, A", "Dean, SR", "Milleret, C", "Donaldson, IM"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "The responses of single units in the vestibular nuclei, nucleus praepositus hypoglossi and in the brainstem, deep and posterior to the abducens nucleus, were studied in anaesthetized, paralysed cats. Natural vestibular stimulation was provided by horizontal, sinusoidal oscillation of the animal and extraocular muscle afferents of the ipsilateral eye were activated either by passive eye-movement or by electrical stimulation of the inferior oblique branch of the oculomotor nerve in the orbit. Unit responses to vestibular and/or orbital stimuli were examined in sets of peristimulus time histograms interleaved in time. Of 127 units exposed to both types of stimulus, 40 (32%) responded only to vestibular input; 46 (32%) were affected only by the orbital afferent signal and 19 (15%) received both signals; the remaining 22 units (17%) were discarded because they had polymodal (usually somaesthetic) input. Of the 93 units whose recording sites were determined histologically, 24 were in the medial vestibular nucleus, 16 in the n. praepositus hypoglossi and 45 in the magnocellular nucleus of the reticular formation posterior and deep to the abducens nucleus. In these three nuclei 19 units in total were found which carried the orbital proprioceptive afferent signal and also responded to horizontal vestibular stimulation. The input from the eye muscles proved able to modify the vestibular response by adding excitation or inhibition or both. Effects of the orbital signal were generally phasic. About half of the units which responded to passive eye-movement showed statistically significant differences between their responses to horizontal and to vertical eye-movement. We have shown previously that signals from extraocular muscle proprioceptors reach the vestibulo-oculomotor system in an amphibian and a bony fish; the present experiments show that this is the case in a mammal also. The fact that the visual and visuomotor behaviour of these three species is very different suggests that the proprioceptive signal may play some rather fundamental role in the vestibulo-ocular system. The principal interest of the present results is that they demonstrate that units in the central vestibular system of the cat, in structures which are known to be concerned in oculomotor control, and particularly in the organization of horizontal eye-movement, receive an afferent signal from the eye muscles during passive eye-movement. These brainstem nuclei are known to receive various combinations of input from the vestibular and visual systems and of signals which represent neck movement and eye position and velocity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Functional mapping of the brainstem during centrally evoked bradycardia: a 2-deoxyglucose study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "3535998", "authors": ["Gonzalez-Lima, F"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Behavioural brain research", "abstract": "Autoradiographic 2-deoxy-[14C] glucose (2-DG) procedures were used to map the functional activity of the brainstem during bradycardia elicited in awake rats by stimulation of the deep mesencephalic nucleus of the midbrain reticular formation (MRF). Quantitative determinations of 2-DG uptake in 46 brainstem structures of MRF-stimulated rats were compared to those of control rats without stimulation. This paper is the first 2-DG study to map the brainstem structures involved in a heart rate response evoked by central stimulation. The structures activated in the midbrain, caudal to the stimulation site, are part of the reticular formation and the central gray. The greater focuses of labeling were concentrated on the lateral aspects of the deep mesencephalic nucleus and on the lateral divisions of the midbrain central gray. The remaining structures activated during bradycardia were all located in the caudal medulla. The largest increase was observed in the caudal nucleus ambiguus. Significant increases were also found in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and in the nucleus of the solitary tract. The region of the caudal inferior olive showed a small increase in 2-DG uptake, whereas structures like the raphe magnus and parvocellular reticular nucleus showed a tendency to reduce 2-DG uptake levels in the stimulated rat. It was concluded that bradycardia induced centrally by MRF stimulation may be mediated by well-defined brainstem descending pathways, direct and indirect, between the activated regions of the midbrain and the various medullary nuclei known to induce bradycardia upon electrical stimulation. The results suggest that the midbrain central gray and reticular formation may play a role as intermediates in an indirect hypothalamus-medullary circuitry for bradycardia. In addition, descending MRF information and afferent baroreceptor inputs appear to exert their inhibitory influences on heart rate via a common set of neuroanatomical substrates in the medulla.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "271", "title": "Frontal eye field efferents in the macaque monkey: II.

Injections of tritiated amino acids or WGA-HRP were made into FEF cortical locations where low-level microstimulation (less than or equal to 50 microA) elicited saccadic eye movements, and anterograde axonal labeling was mapped. The injections were made into the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus from dorsomedial sites where large saccades were evoked (lFEF) to ventrolateral sites where small saccades were evoked (sFEF). The largest terminal fields of FEF fibers were located in the ipsilateral superior colliculus (SC). Projections to SC were topographically organized: lFEF sites projected to intermediate and deep layers of caudal SC, sFEF sites projected to intermediate and superficial layers of rostral SC, and FEF sites between these extremes projected to intermediate locations in SC. Patches of terminal labeling were located ipsilaterally in the lateral mesencephalic reticular formation near the parabigeminal nucleus and the ventrolateral pontine reticular formation. These patches were larger from lFEF injections. Small, dense terminal patches were seen in the ipsilateral pontine gray, mostly along the medial and dorsal borders of these nuclei but occasionally in central and dorsolateral regions. Patches of label like those in the pontine nuclei were located ipsilaterally in the reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus in lFEF cases and bilaterally in sFEF cases. Small terminal patches were found in the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and dorsal and medial parts of the parvicellular red nucleus in most FEF cases. In the pretectal region, labeled terminal patches were consistently found in the nucleus limitans of the posterior thalamus, but we could not determine if label in the nucleus of the pretectal area and dorsal parts of the nucleus of the posterior commissure marked axon terminals or fibers of passage. We found small, lightly labeled terminal patches in the pontine raphe between the rootlets of the abducens nerve (three cases) or in the adjacent paramedian pontine reticular formation (one case). Omnipauser cells in this region are important in initiating saccades.

These data are compatible with the hypothesis that distinct generators are responsible for the two components. Scalp potential field configuration observed for Na suggests a deep generator, which could be situated at the mesencephalic or diencephalic level.

In partially restrained cats, thermal pulses (greater than or equal to 47 degrees C) delivered to the hindlimbs of intact cats or rostral to lesions of the thoracic spinal cord elicited abrupt body movements and interruption of eating (or of exploring for) liquified food. These electronically monitored responses automatically terminated the stimulus. Natural modulation of responsiveness was produced by delivering food and thermal stimuli simultaneously; this reduced response probability by an average of 41%. Complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord eliminated both thermally elicited responses and orienting responses to noxious and tactile mechanical stimulation of the hindlimbs. Ventral bilateral thoracic spinal cord lesions that spared only the dorsal funiculus and portions of the dorsolateral funiculus (three cats) significantly reduced orienting responses to all mechanical hindlimb stimuli and reduced, but did not eliminate, movement and interrupt responses to noxious thermal hindlimb stimuli. Response latency was unaffected. Food-induced response suppression persisted although lumbar spinal cord concentrations of serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) were markedly reduced. A bilateral lesion of the dorsal funiculi and dorsal portions of the dorsolateral funiculi (one cat) also reduced nocifensive responsiveness, but only the NE concentration in lumbar spinal cord was reduced significantly relative to a matched cervical sample. In contrast, deep bilateral lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi (two cats) produced an increase in the probability of movement and interrupt responses without affecting either response latency or food-induced response suppression. Lumbar spinal cord concentrations of NE and, in one cat, 5HT were reduced. We conclude that (1) the dorsal and ventral spinal funiculi are each sufficient to initiate and necessary to maintain normal supraspinally organized nocifensive behavior in the cat; (2) descending monoaminergic pathways are not necessary for the phasic modulation of these responses; and (3) the tonic excitability, but not the phasic modulation, of these responses is determined in part by fibers in the dorsolateral funiculus.", "pages": "300-13"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Current generators and properties of late components evoked in rat olfactory cortex.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "4952225", "authors": ["Ferreyra-Moyano, H", "Cinelli, AR", "Molina, JC", "Barrag\u00e1n, E"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Brain research bulletin", "abstract": "Following main olfactory bulb (MOB) stimulation at frequencies of 0.1-0.3 Hz, in addition to early field potentials, a frequency-sensitive, surface negative late N2 wave (latency range: 63-96 msec) followed occasionally by a late N3 transient, was evoked in the piriform cortex and endopiriform nucleus of the rat.

Response probability, peak latency, recovery curve and frequency-sensitivity of the P2 wave were not significantly different in animals under urethane or pentobarbital. Current-source-density (CSD) analysis revealed that the N2 wave generators were localized to the Ib-II layer interface. Since inhibitory activity does not contribute substantially to the second derivative curve, CSD analysis strengthens the assumption that late components (LCs) are excitatory events (compound EPSPs) presumably generated on the proximal apical dendritic segments of pyramidal cells by association axons. The early \"b\" wave in a test response was facilitated, rather than occluded, when a LC was present in the conditioning response, or when the priming volley was delivered to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

This was characterized by a representation of the facial musculature, which partially enclosed and overlapped the rostral, medial, and caudal borders of the more laterally located cortical regions representing the jaw and tongue musculatures. Responses were evoked at ICMS thresholds as low as 1 microA, and the latency of the suprathreshold EMG responses ranged from 10 to 45 ms. 3.
