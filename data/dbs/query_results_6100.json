However, an increased number of large stellate or elongated somata in deep laminae III-V of the L5 segment expressed high nNOS immunoreactivity. The alterations of NOS catalytic activity in the spinal segments L4-L6 and corresponding DRGs closely correlated with nNOS distribution detected by immunocytochemistry. No such changes were detected in the contralateral DRGs or spinal cord of sham-operated rats. The results indicate that marked alterations of nNOS in the DRG cells and in the spinal cord may contribute to spinal sensory processing as well as to the development of neuronal plasticity phenomena in the dorsal horn.", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "Beyond the iron mask: towards better recognition and treatment of depression associated with Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "12112190", "authors": ["Burn, DJ"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of sensorimotor thalamus containing \"tremor cells\" leads to tremor arrest in humans with parkinsonian and essential tremor.

In the past decade, there has been a new emphasis on the use of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures to describe patient response to treatment. We describe patient-reported HRQOL in subjects who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nuclei (STN) for the treatment of PD, compared with a similar group of subjects who did not receive surgical treatment. A consecutive series of patients (n = 11) with advanced idiopathic PD were treated with DBS of the STN.

Self-reported HRQOL, measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) was evaluated at three time periods T(0), T(3), and T(6). The surgery group was evaluated according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Sale (UPDRS) before (T(0)), 3 (T(3)), and 6 months (T(6)) after surgery.

Studies investigating the frequency of depression in PD have yielded figures ranging between 2.7% and 70%. Methodological differences account for much of the disparity. The aetiology of depression in PD is complex, and probably relates to both biological and exogenous factors. Dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system, may be involved. Mood disturbances resulting from deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may provide a fruitful area for future research, and assist our understanding of the neural networks involved in mediating depression. Several recent studies have confirmed that depression in the PD patient is a major determinant of quality of life and that this is closely related to dysfunction in other clinically important health areas. The validity for many existing scales in the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of depression in the PD patient has not been established. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression appear to have good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared with DSM-IV criteria. Recommendations for the optimal drug treatment of depression in PD are difficult to give, due to an inexplicable dearth of sizeable, placebo-controlled studies. A majority of physicians would probably now opt for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the depressed PD patient. There is no good evidence that these drugs are associated with a worsening of motor features, but they should probably not be coprescribed with selegiline, because of the risk of causing a potentially serious serotonin syndrome. Several studies have suggested that depression in the PD patient is associated with a more rapid deterioration in cognitive and motor functions, perhaps as a surrogate marker for more extensive brainstem cell loss.", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}, {"volume": "17", "title": "[Weight gain after functional surgery for Parkinsons disease].", "issue": "6", "pmid": "12084357", "authors": ["Gironell, A", "Pascual-Sedano, B", "Otermin, P", "Kulisevsky, J"], "year": "", "journal": "Neurolog\u00eda (Barcelona, Spain)", "abstract": "For the treatment of medically refractory movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and primary dystonia, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become one of the main treatment options.

The aim of this work was to study the physiology of trigeminocervical input in a model of cranial nociception by describing a population of nociceptive neurones that receive convergent input from the supratentorial dura and the GON. Rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital, paralysed and ventilated. The parietal dura above the middle meningeal artery was stimulated through a closed cranial window. The GON was exposed in the neck and stimulated. Recordings were made from 67 neurones (52 wide dynamic range neurones/15 nociceptive-specific-neurones) in the C(2) spinal dorsal horn, which responded to stimulation of the dura and the GON. Most neurones showed receptive fields corresponding to the first trigeminal division as well as input from C(2) skin and muscle. Neurones were recorded in superficial and deep layers of the dorsal horn. All neurones tested received input from the ipsilateral and contralateral GON (n = 5). The responses to dural stimulation were analysed before and after stimulation of the GON. Supramaximal electrical stimulation of the GON (20 s to 5 min) enhanced afferent dural input in 8/20 neurones. Application of the C-fibre activator mustard oil (MO) to the cutaneous receptive field or suboccipital muscles innervated by the GON induced an increased excitability of dural responses in 8/12 and 9/10 neurones, respectively. Stimulation of muscle afferents had a significant longer facilitatory effect than cutaneous stimulation (P < 0.05). These results show that a considerable population of neurones show convergent input from both dura as well as cervical cutaneous and muscle territories, which supports the view of a functional continuum between the caudal trigeminal nucleus and upper cervical segments involved in cranial nociception. The facilitatory effect of GON stimulation on dural stimulation suggests a central mechanism at the second order neurone level. This mechanism may be important in pain referral from cervical structures to the head and therefore have implications for most forms of primary headache.", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Blood flow responses to deep brain stimulation of thalamus.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "12021954", "authors": ["Perlmutter, JS", "Mink, JW", "Bastian, AJ", "Zackowski, K", "Hershey, T", "Miyawaki, E", "Koller, W", "Videen, TO"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "In addition to its involvement in the transmission of neuropathic pain, the dorsal column system has been shown to have analgesic effects when electrically stimulated.

Mononeuropathy was induced, under deep anesthesia, in several groups of rats (n=7 each) following either the chronic constriction injury or the spared nerve injury model.

Selective dorsal column bilateral lesions were performed at the upper cervical level in some groups of rats. Dorsal column nuclear stimulation, rostral to selective dorsal spinal lesions, produced strong inhibitory effects on the allodynia and hyperalgesia observed in both models of mononeuropathy. These effects were comparable to those observed following similar stimulations in rats with an intact spinal cord. Our results demonstrate strong inhibitory effects of dorsal column stimulation on neuropathic pain.

Multimodal DSC neurons show the properties of multisensory enhancement, in which the neural response to an input of one modality is augmented by input of another modality, and of inverse effectiveness, in which weaker unimodal responses produce a higher percentage enhancement. Previously, we demonstrated that these properties are consistent with the hypothesis that DSC neurons use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability that a target is present given their stochastic sensory inputs. Here we use an information theoretic analysis of our Bayesian model to show that input of an additional modality may indeed increase target information, but only if input received from the initial modality does not completely reduce uncertainty concerning the presence of a target.

To better understand the mechanism of action of such treatment we studied the effects of stimulation of the periventricular gray (PVG) on the sensory thalamus in two patients with chronic central pain. In each case, two electrodes were implanted in the PVG (Medtronic 3389) and the ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus (Medtronic 3387), respectively, under guidance of CT/MRI image fusion. The PVG was stimulated in the frequency range of 2-100 Hz in alert patients while pain was assessed using the McGill-Melzack visual analogue scale. In addition, local field potentials (FPs) were recorded from the sensory thalamus during PVG stimulation. Maximum pain relief was obtained with 5-25 Hz stimulation while 50-100 Hz made the pain worse. This suggests that pain suppression was frequency dependent. Interestingly, we detected low frequency FPs at 0.2-0.4 Hz closely associated with the pain. During 5-25 Hz PVG stimulation the amplitude of this potential was significantly reduced and this was associated with marked pain relief. At the higher frequencies (50-100 Hz) however, there was no reduction in the FPs and no pain suppression. We have found an interesting correlation between thalamic activity and chronic pain. This curious low frequency potential may provide an objective index for quantifying chronic pain, and may hold further clues to the mechanism of action of PVG stimulation.", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}, {"volume": "17 Suppl 3", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for dystonia: patient selection and evaluation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "11948769", "authors": ["Volkmann, J", "Benecke, R"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "To determine the incidence of long-term hardware-related complications of deep brain stimulation (DBS).", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}, {"volume": "17 Suppl 3", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for tremor [correction of trauma]: patient selection and evaluation.", "issue": "", "pmid": "11948768", "authors": ["Deuschl, G", "Bain, P"], "year": "2002", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "The study design is a retrospective chart review of a single-surgeon, single-institution experience with DBS in 84 consecutive cases from 1993 to 1999.

Tracer, single-cell, and lesion studies in monkeys suggest the existence of topologically segregated motor and nonmotor basal ganglia cortical circuits. In this study we used deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posteroventrolateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) in patients with Parkinson's disease to elucidate the function of the GPi in human sensorimotor behavior. This question was investigated by comparing the influence of DBS on patients' performance in various reaction-time tasks that differed with respect to cognitive but not motor requirements. As a main result, DBS improved performance on the different tasks independently of the complexity of the involved cognitive processing functions. Furthermore, the observed effects did not depend on the modality of the processed information. These results suggest that the functional state of the posteroventrolateral GPi selectively affects the motor stage in simple sensorimotor acts, because this stage was the only stage involved in all investigated tasks. In addition to DBS, we manipulated the levodopa medication state of the PD patients. In contrast to DBS, levodopa effects on reaction times were less consistent. Levodopa improved reaction times in choice reaction tasks significantly, while affecting reaction times in a simple reaction task to a lesser extent. Error analysis revealed that the medication-dependent reaction-time improvement in the choice reaction tasks was accompanied by an increase in errors, suggesting a shift of the speed-accuracy criteria of the patients. A similar pattern of results was not observed for the DBS effects. Taken together, our data are in agreement with recent findings in monkeys that indicate a topological organization of the GPi in which motor functions are localized in posterolateral regions apart from cognitive regions.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is well established for Parkinson's disease (PD) and tremor dominant movement disorders. We report on two cases of generalized dystonia which were successfully treated by chronic high frequency stimulation in the Globus pallidus internus (GPI). Two 26 and 27 years old males suffered from severe torsion dystonia and multisegmental dystonia of the lower limbs. Case 1 is a familiar type of dystonia (DYT1 positive). The onset of symptoms in both cases was at age 7. The complaints were initially treated with orally administered benzodiazepines, anticholinergic drugs, later by baclofen and L-DOPA. However there was no response. Case 2 was a patient with a history of left side dominated dystonia since the age of 8. It was first diagnosed as a psychogenic movement disorder. Prior to surgery he was treated with L-DOPA, anticholinergics, Baclofen without any effect. There was only a limited effect on high doses of diazepam. The patient is DYT1 negative. The target point was on both sides the GPI. Intraoperative computerized tomography (CT) and ventriculography (VG) were used for target setting. Furthermore microrecordings were helpful to ensure the exact electrode position. Surgery was performed under analgosedation. Two weeks after surgery we first observed a relief of symptoms in both cases. A significant reduction in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden-Dystonia Movement Rating Scale was observed at the 6 month follow-up (case 1: 95%, case 2: 80%). In case 1 a slight dystonic movement of the left ankle was the only remaining symptom under stimulation. The medication was continuously reduced. At the 24 month follow-up the effect of stimulation remained unchanged. However high stimulation parameters are required to maintain an optimal effect (mean 3.5 V, 400 microseconds, 145 Hz).", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}, {"volume": "47", "title": "Pallidal deep brain stimulation in a parkinsonian patient with late-life dementia: sustained benefit in motor symptoms but not in functional disability.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11897249", "authors": ["Vingerhoets, FJ", "Villemure, JG", "Temperli, P", "Pollo, C", "Pralong, E", "Ghika, J"], "year": "2002", "journal": "European neurology", "abstract": "Twenty cases of a persistent vegetative state (PVS) caused by various kinds of brain damage were neurologically and electrophysiologically evaluated at 3 months after persistence of the PVS, and were treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy.

However, they remained in a bedridden state. These 7 cases revealed a desynchronization or slight desynchronization pattern on continuous EEG frequency analysis. The Vth wave of ABR and N20 of SEP could be recorded even with a prolonged latency, and the pain-related P250 was recorded with an amplitude of over 7 microV. We conclude that chronic DBS therapy may be useful for allowing the patient to emerge from a PVS, if the candidates are selected according to the neurophysiological criteria.

In addition, we attempted to determine the trajectories of the axons of the examined neurons within the diencephalon and brainstem. Fifty-three SHT neurons were recorded within segments T8-T13 in urethane anesthetized rats. Each cell was antidromically activated using current pulses < or = 30 microA delivered from the tip of an electrode located within the contralateral hypothalamus. The recording points were located in the superficial dorsal horn (9) and deep dorsal horn (44). All examined SHT neurons had receptive fields on the posterior thorax and anterior and ventral abdomen of the ipsilateral side. Ninety percent of the 41 SHT neurons responded exclusively (13) or preferentially (24) to noxious cutaneous stimuli. Thirteen of 27 (48%) examined units were activated by forceful distention of the bile duct. Response thresholds ranged from 30 to 40 mmHg. Responses incremented as pressures were increased to 50-80 mmHg. The axons of 22 of 28 (79%) examined SHT neurons appeared to cross the midline within the hypothalamus and terminate in the ipsilateral hypothalamus, thalamus or midbrain.

We also explore possible links between craniocerebral trauma and parkinsonism. The cause-effect relationship between head injury and subsequent movement disorder is not fully appreciated. This may be related partially to the delayed appearance of the movement disorder. Movement disorders after severe head injury have been reported in 13 to 66% of patients. Although movement disorders after mild or moderate head injury are frequently transient and, in general, do not result in additional disability, kinetic tremors and dystonia may be a source of marked disability in survivors of severe head injury. Functional stereotactic surgery provides long-term symptomatic and functional benefits in the majority of patients. Thalamic radiofrequency lesioning, although beneficial in some patients, frequently is associated with side effects such as increased dysarthria or gait disturbance, particularly in patients with kinetic tremor secondary to diffuse axonal injury. Deep brain stimulation is used increasingly as an option in such patients. It remains unclear whether pallidal or thalamic targets are more beneficial for treatment of posttraumatic dystonia. Trauma to the central nervous system is an important causative factor in a variety of movement disorders. The mediation of the effects of trauma and the pathophysiology of the development of posttraumatic movement disorders require further study. Functional stereotactic surgery should be considered in patients with disabling movement disorders refractory to medical treatment.", "pages": "306-11; discussion 311-3"}]
