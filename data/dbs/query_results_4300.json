At its onset, large destructive procedures like open resection of cortex, parts of the basal ganglia or its fibre connections produced variable, ill-documented results. With the introduction of the stereotactic operating technique in the second half of the century, ablative surgery became more refined, and more selective interventions became possible to alleviate the suffering of those patients for whom no other treatment modalities were yet available. However, the introduction of levodopa-based pharmacological therapy pushed surgical therapy almost completely to the background. In the past two decades, there has been a resurgence of interest in surgery for movement disorders, due to both limitations of long-term pharmacological therapy and the advent of the treatment modality of deep brain stimulation. The subject has now grown into a large field of clinical and scientific interest. Parkinson's disease is the most widespread surgical indication, but in other movement disorders considerable improvement can be achieved by surgery as well, most notably in dystonia. A short review of the surgical therapy for these disorders is presented.", "pages": "119-25"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for neuropathic pain.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17691296", "authors": ["Owen, SL", "Green, AL", "Nandi, DD", "Bittar, RG", "Wang, S", "Aziz, TZ"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

This study reports the outcome of DBS of the sensory thalamus and the periventricular and peri-aqueductal grey area (PVG/PAG) complex for different intractable neuropathic pain syndromes. Forty-seven patients (30 males and 17 females) were selected for surgery; they were suffering from any of the following types of pain: post-stroke neuropathic pain, phantom limb pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, anaesthesia dolorosa, brachial plexus injury and neuropathic pain secondary to neural damage from a variety of causes. Of the 47 patients selected for trial stimulation, 38 patients proceeded to permanent implantation. Patients suffering from post-stroke pain were the most likely to fail trial stimulation (33%), in contrast to individuals with phantom limb/post-brachial plexus injury pain and anaesthesia dolorosa, all of whom underwent permanent implantation. PVG stimulation alone was optimal in 17 patients (53%), whilst a combination of PVG and thalamic stimulation produced the greatest degree of analgesia in 11 patients (34%). Thalamic stimulation alone was optimal in 4 patients (13%). DBS of the PVG alone was associated with the highest degree of pain alleviation, with a mean improvement of 59% (p <0.001) and a > or =50% improvement in 66% of patients. Post-stroke pain responds in 70% of patients. We conclude that the outcomes of surgery appear to vary according to aetiology, but it would appear that the effects are best for phantom limb syndromes, head pain and anaesthesia dolorosa.", "pages": "119-25"}, {"volume": "97", "title": "Neuromodulatory approaches to the treatment of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.", "issue": "Pt 2", "pmid": "17691295", "authors": ["Goadsby, PJ"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

The first, a non-destructive approach, uses either electrical stimulation of brain targets thought to modulate the process of pain perception, or pharmacological agents are introduced into ventricular spaces to target pain modulating receptors. Electrical stimulation targets include; the thalamic nuclei, the periventricular and periaqueductal grey (PVG and PAG) matter or the motor cortex. Currently, the pharmacological agent of choice for intracerebroventricular injection is morphine. In general, electrical stimulation is used for nonmalignant type pain, and pharmacological modulation for malignant type pain. The second, a destructive approach, is usually employed with the goal of interrupting the signals that lead to pain perception at various levels. Neuroablation is usually performed on cellular complexes such as \"nuclei, or gyri\" or on tracts with the aim of disrupting the sensory and limbic pathways involved in the emotional processes associated with pain. Specific cerebral neuroablation targets include; the thalamic medial group of nuclei, the cingulated gyrus, and the trigeminal nucleus and tract.

These data indicate that in operative neuromodulation, a new field emerges that is based on neural networks research and on advances in digitised stereometric brain imaging which allow precise localisation of cerebral neural networks and their relay stations; this field can be described as Neural networks surgery because it aims to act extrinsically or intrinsically on neural networks and to alter therapeutically the neural signal transmission with the use of implantable electrical or electronic devices. The authors also review neurotechnology literature relevant to neuroengineering, nanotechnologies, brain computer interfaces, hybrid cultured probes, neuromimetics, neuroinformatics, neurocomputation, and computational neuromodulation; the latter field is dedicated to the study of the biophysical and mathematical characteristics of electrochemical neuromodulation. The article also brings forward particularly interesting lines of research such as the carbon nanofibers electrode arrays for simultaneous electrochemical recording and stimulation, closed-loop systems for responsive neuromodulation, and the intracortical electrodes for restoring hearing or vision.

Disorders of consciousness that persist for longer than 12 months after severe traumatic brain injury are generally considered to be immutable; no treatment has been shown to accelerate recovery or improve functional outcome in such cases. Recent studies have shown unexpected preservation of large-scale cerebral networks in patients in the minimally conscious state (MCS), a condition that is characterized by intermittent evidence of awareness of self or the environment. These findings indicate that there might be residual functional capacity in some patients that could be supported by therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that further recovery in some patients in the MCS is limited by chronic underactivation of potentially recruitable large-scale networks. Here, in a 6-month double-blind alternating crossover study, we show that bilateral deep brain electrical stimulation (DBS) of the central thalamus modulates behavioural responsiveness in a patient who remained in MCS for 6 yr following traumatic brain injury before the intervention. The frequency of specific cognitively mediated behaviours (primary outcome measures) and functional limb control and oral feeding (secondary outcome measures) increased during periods in which DBS was on as compared with periods in which it was off. Logistic regression modelling shows a statistical linkage between the observed functional improvements and recent stimulation history. We interpret the DBS effects as compensating for a loss of arousal regulation that is normally controlled by the frontal lobe in the intact brain.

The gold standard continues to rely on probabilistic and indirect targeting, relative to a stereotactic reference, i.e., mostly the anterior (AC) and the posterior (PC) commissures. The theoretical position of a target defined on an atlas is transposed into the stereotactic space of a patient's brain; final positioning depends on electrophysiological analysis. The method is also used to analyze final electrode or lesion position for a patient or group of patients, by projection on an atlas. Limitations are precision of definition of the AC-PC line, probabilistic location and reliability of the electrophysiological guidance. Advances in MR imaging, as from 1.5-T machines, make stereotactic references no longer mandatory and allow an anatomic mapping based on an individual patient's brain. Direct targeting is enabled by high-quality images, an advanced anatomic knowledge and dedicated surgical software. Labeling associated with manual segmentation can help for the position analysis along non-conventional, interpolated planes. Analysis of final electrode or lesion position, for a patient or group of patients, could benefit from the concept of membership, the attribution of a weighted membership degree to a contact or a structure according to its level of involvement.

We examined the effects of paired-pulse thalamic DBS on tremor in subjects with essential tremor and on the firing of model neurons in a biophysically based computational model of DBS. DBS with an average rate of 130 Hz was more effective at reducing tremor when pulses were evenly spaced than when there were large differences between intrapair and interpair pulse intervals. Similar correlations were observed in the firing patterns of model neurons: increasing the difference between the intrapair and interpair intervals rendered model neurons more likely to fire synchronous bursts, more likely to fire irregularly, and less likely to entrain to the stimulus. The tremor responses provide evidence that the pulse-to-pulse frequency of DBS, not just its average rate, plays an important role in DBS function.

The possible presence and roles of I(NaR) in neurons of the cerebral cortex and temporal-lobe memory system are still uncharacterized. In this study whole-cell, patch-clamp experiments were carried out in acute rat brain slices to investigate I(NaR) expression and properties in several neuronal populations of the parahippocampal region and hippocampal formation. Specifically, we examined pyramidal neurons of perirhinal cortex areas 36 and 35 (layers II and V); neurons of superficial and deep layers of medial entorhinal cortex (mEC); dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells; and pyramidal cells of the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal fields.

A vast majority of areas 36 and 35 neurons (both in layers II and V) and mEC layer-III and -V neurons were also endowed with I(NaR), although at lower amplitude levels.

These issues remain unresolved; however, significant strides have been made in understanding the illness from both phenomenological and pathophysiological perspectives. The current staple of OCD management remains pharmacological in nature and often occurs in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy. Refractory cases, however, are occasionally referred for neurosurgical consultation, and several procedures have been examined. Success in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the reversibility of the therapy, and a relatively safe side-effect profile have allowed deep brain stimulation (DBS) to be examined as an alternative treatment for some psychiatric conditions. Here we assess the possibility of applying DBS to the treatment of OCD. Morphological, functional metabolic, and volumetric data point to several brain regions that are important to the etiology and maintenance of OCD. Converging evidence from the genetics and neurocircuitry literature suggests that several subcortical structures play prominent roles in the disease. The functional modification of these structures could potentially provide symptom relief. Here, we review the ablative and DBS procedures for refractory OCD, and provide a research-driven hypothesis that highlights the ventromedial head of the caudate nucleus, and structures up- and downstream from it, as potential DBS targets for treatment-resistant disease.

Direct measurements of extracellular glutamate concentration in the STN were made using a dual enzyme-based electrochemical sensor. The studies were carried out in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized rats placed in a Kopf stereotaxic head frame.

The concentration of glutamate rose quickly during HFS, remained elevated for the duration of stimulation, and descended slowly towards baseline upon cessation of stimulation. Elevation of the extracellular concentration of glutamate in the STN may be an important mechanism whereby DBS in the STN improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Accumulating evidence indicates that fibromyalgia may involve a dysfunction of modulatory systems in the brain. While brain dopamine is best known for its role in pleasure, motivation and motor control, recent evidence suggests that it is also involved in pain modulation. Because dopamine is implicated in both pain modulation and affective processing, we hypothesized that fibromyalgia may involve a disturbance of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Fibromyalgia patients and matched healthy control subjects were subjected to deep muscle pain produced by injection of hypertonic saline into the anterior tibialis muscle. In order to determine the endogenous release of dopamine in response to painful stimulation, we used positron emission tomography to examine binding of [(11)C]-raclopride (D2/D3 ligand) in the brain during injection of painful hypertonic saline and nonpainful normal saline. Fibromyalgia patients experienced the hypertonic saline as more painful than healthy control subjects. Control subjects released dopamine in the basal ganglia during the painful stimulation, whereas fibromyalgia patients did not. In control subjects, the amount of dopamine release correlated with the amount of perceived pain but in fibromyalgia patients no such correlation was observed. These findings provide the first direct evidence that fibromyalgia patients have an abnormal dopamine response to pain. The disrupted dopaminergic reactivity in fibromyalgia patients could be a critical factor underlying the widespread pain and discomfort in fibromyalgia and suggests that the therapeutic effects of dopaminergic treatments for this intractable disorder should be explored.", "pages": "119-25"}, {"volume": "164", "title": "Intracellular long-wavelength voltage-sensitive dyes for studying the dynamics of action potentials in axons and thin dendrites.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "11508732", "authors": ["Zhou, WL", "Yan, P", "Wuskell, JP", "Loew, LM", "Antic, SD"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "abstract": "Pharmacological inhibition and high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) suppress seizures in different animal models of epilepsy.

Single SNr stimulation that was bilateral, bipolar and monophasic at 60 Hz frequency and with 60-micros pulse width was optimal. However, when used for repeated stimulations, long-term suppression did not occur and even the number of seizures increased.

Although it has been suggested that these patterns of MTL activation could reflect the creation of novel associations into memory, it is unclear whether associative encoding and associative novelty detection rely on the same MTL substructures. In this study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) to reproduce previous reports of greater hippocampal activation for associative encoding using both arbitrary and semantically related object pairs. This paradigm allowed us to assess whether the requirement for associative processing at encoding interacts with associative novelty. Contrasting the pattern of activation for associative versus item-oriented encoding revealed greater right hippocampal activation as well as parahippocampal activation bilaterally, reproducing the findings from previous PET experiments. The orthogonal contrast between arbitrary and related pairs revealed greater activation in the left parahippocampal region, but no significant interaction between the type of encoding (associative or item oriented) and the type of pairs (arbitrary or semantically related) was observed in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). These results suggest that both associative processing and associative novelty detection can activate the MTL.

To test the functional impact of this change, we investigated the effects of dopamine agonists on PFC excitatory synaptic transmission with whole-cell recordings from deep-layer pyramidal neurons in brain slices obtained from prepubertal [postnatal day (PD) 28-35] and postpubertal (PD>51) rats. Electrical stimulation of superficial layers elicited a fast AMPA/kainate excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). In the adult PFC, the D2 agonist quinpirole decreased EPSP amplitude, an effect that lasted for at least 25 min after drug washout and was blocked by the D2 antagonist eticlopride. The late component of this effect was blocked by the GABA-A antagonist picrotoxin without affecting the early inhibition. Quinpirole also decreased EPSP amplitude in deep-layer pyramidal neurons from prepubertal rats, but this response was not affected by picrotoxin. A D1 agonist, on the other hand, did not affect the pyramidal neuron EPSP. These results indicate that D2, not D1, receptors attenuate local excitatory synaptic transmission in the adult PFC, and this effect of D2 involves a recruitment of local GABAergic activity.", "pages": "119-25"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "Motor cortex stimulation for levodopa-resistant akinesia: case report.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "12354400", "authors": ["Tani, N", "Saitoh, Y", "Kishima, H", "Oshino, S", "Hatazawa, J", "Hashikawa, K", "Yoshimine, T"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Problems with shifting attentional set and concurrent performance of tasks are key cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD).

We studied the effects of stimulation frequency and amplitude on the output of a population of intrinsically active model neurons to test the hypothesis that regularization of neuronal firing patterns is responsible for the clinical effectiveness of DBS. The firing patterns of model thalamocortical neurons were dependent on stimulation frequency and amplitude in a manner similar to the clinical tremor response. Above a critical frequency, increasing amplitude reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) of the neuronal firing pattern, whereas for low frequencies, increasing the amplitude increased the CV of neuronal activity.

Locomotor profiles of all of the muscles tested were found to be substantially affected by STN stimulation, either in terms of restoration/enhancement of the main activity bursts or normalization of recruitment timing thereof. Responses showed relatively higher statistical significance in the distal groups (GAM and TA) and, within them, for the EMG components called into action over the ground-contact (ankle dorsiflexors) and midstance (ankle plantarflexors) phases of the stride cycle. In line with data obtained from clinical rating, unilateral stimulation produced less consistent EMG changes compared with bilateral stimulation. However, at variance with clinical effects, which prevailed on the side of the body contralateral to stimulation, EMG responses to unilateral stimulation were usually symmetrical. Results indicate that the impact of STN stimulation on locomotor activation of lower limb muscles in PD is characterized by: 1) substantial effects exhibiting differential topographical (distal versus proximal) and stride-phase (stance versus swing) consistency and 2) absence of the lateralized actions typically observed for the clinical signs of the disease.

In PD patients, STN DBS reduced both resting and activated rigidity as indicated by work and the UPDRS rigidity score. This is the first demonstration that STN stimulation reduces rigidity using an objective measure such as work.

Dystonia may be primary where an abnormal gene, most commonly DYT1, may be identified, or secondary to structural brain lesions or heredodegenerative disorders. The underlying defect is believed to be abnormal basal ganglia modulation of cortical motor pathways, and various motor and sensory physiological abnormalities have been demonstrated. The failure of medical treatment in many patients with the more severe and generalized forms of dystonia has led to renewed interest in neurosurgical treatment approaches. In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of globus pallidus internus (GPi) has emerged as an effective treatment for dystonia, particularly patients with primary generalized dystonia, where remarkable improvement may occur. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, the beneficial effects of DBS in dystonia are not immediate but progressive over weeks to months. Physiological and imaging studies in dystonia patients with GPi DBS have demonstrated both short and long-term effects of GPi DBS on motor cortex and subcortical circuits including progressive normalization of spinal and brainstem excitability after GPi DBS which correlate with clinical improvement. These effects, in light of existing physiological data in dystonia, suggest that GPi DBS acts primarily by major modification of basal ganglia output to brainstem, thalamus, and cortex resulting in neural reorganization, which may explain the characteristic progressive improvement in dystonia after GPi DBS.", "pages": "119-25"}, {"volume": "182", "title": "Experimental muscle pain decreases the frequency threshold of electrically elicited muscle cramps.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15128399", "authors": ["Serrao, M", "Arendt-Nielsen, L", "Ge, HY", "Pierelli, F", "Sandrini, G", "Farina, D"], "year": "2007", "journal": "Experimental brain research.
