METHODS Left Gpi-DBS and/or L-dopa effect was studied with auditory paced right-handed sequential movements on (15)O-butanol positron emission tomography (PET) in five patients. Rest and for conditions during movements (DBS off/L-dopa off; DBS on/L-dopa off; DBS off/L-dopa on; DBS on/L-dopa on) were compared with statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS Gpi-DBS activated the right supplementary motor area/premotor (SMA/PMC), and right insular cortex (IC), and as L-dopa decreased the left sensorimotor cortex (M1/S1) activity. L-dopa increased the left ventrolateral thalamus (VLTH), and decreased the left superior parietal cortex (PC) activity. Gpi-DBS and L-dopa interaction showed right SMA/PMC, IC, and left PC activation, decrease of left VLTH, PMC, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. CONCLUSIONS The improvement of bradykinesia with Gpi-DBS is secondary and contributed to the regress of M1/S1-related rigidity and compensatory SMA/PMC, and IC activation. L-dopa and Gpi-DBS alone each reduces M1/S1 overactivity. Interaction ignores this effect, moreover has akinetic effect in the left VLTH, PMC, and PFC.

In animal models of PD, stimulation and lesioning of the STN have some effects which are the same, but others which differ, in reversing cellular and behavioral changes induced by dopamine depletion. We compared the effects of short-term STN stimulation and lesions upon extracellular levels of dopamine and metabolites using in vivo microdialysis of the dorsal striatum of awake, intact and unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA)-lesioned rats. STN stimulation in control rats decreased striatal dopamine levels and caused a relative increase in dopamine metabolism, as expressed by HVA/dopamine and DOPAC/dopamine ratios. This suggests an increase in both vesicular dopamine release (metabolized to HVA), and release from the cytoplasmic dopamine pool (metabolized to DOPAC). STN lesions in control rats increased the HVA/dopamine ratio, also suggesting a relative increase in vesicular dopamine release. These results indicate that STN stimulation and lesioning can affect striatal dopamine metabolism in the intact system. In 6OHDA-lesioned rats at baseline, metabolic ratios were markedly decreased as compared with controls. STN lesions of 6OHDA-lesioned rats did not affect relative metabolic ratios as compared with baseline levels. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, STN stimulation decreased extracellular levels of dopamine, and, to a greater extent, metabolites, resulting in a decrease in metabolic ratios. This further decrease in dopamine turnover with STN stimulation would serve to maintain dopamine levels in the dopamine-depleted striatum, and may account for the therapeutic benefit of DBS in Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "823-30"}, {"volume": "63", "title": "Subthalamic nucleus stimulation and lesioning have distinct state-dependent effects upon striatal dopamine metabolism.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "17169512", "authors": ["Kimura, T", "Ozaki, I", "Hashimoto, I"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Synapse (New York, N.Y.)", "abstract": "Orchestrating cortical network activity with synchronous oscillations of neurons across distant regions of the brain underlies information processing in humans (Knight, 2007) and monkeys (Saalmann et al., 2007; Womelsdorf et al., 2007).

These are a common clinical problem occurring in up to 90% of patients and more frequently affect those with early-onset. Dyskinesias have a negative impact on quality of life and are an important cause of disability. Their precise etiology is still poorly understood, although it is recognized that dopaminergic pre-synaptic and post-synaptic mechanisms are involved together with extra-dopaminergic factors. The phenomenology of dyskinesias encompasses a variable mixture of two prevalent features: dystonia and chorea. We have studied their time course following a single acute levodopa challenge and have found that dystonia occurs throughout the duration of the on period, whereas choreiform movements occur only at the peak of therapeutic dopaminergic motor responses. This allows a schematic relationship to be drawn between a short duration motor response and the occurrence of dystonia and chorea. There is currently no satisfactory treatment for dyskinesias. Managing the therapeutic window does not provide an adequate solution due to the appearance of a dyskinesia threshold dose that narrows the therapeutic margin. High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus probably has some specific anti-dyskinetic action, but is limited by the small number of patients who are candidates for this treatment.

When these options fail, achievement of motor control requires more complex therapeutic strategies: continuous infusion of dopaminergic drugs or neuromodulation with deep brain stimulation (DBS).

The mechanism by which STN DBS elicits its beneficial effect, however, remains unclear. We previously reported STN stimulation increased the rate and produced a more regular and periodic pattern of neuronal activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). Here we extend our observations to neurons in the pallidal [ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) and ventralis anterior (VA)] and cerebellar [ventralis lateralis posterior pars oralis (VPLo)] receiving areas of the motor thalamus during STN DBS. Stimulation parameters that produced improvement in rigidity and bradykinesia resulted in changes in the pattern and power of oscillatory activity of neuronal activity that were similar in both regions of the motor thalamus. Neurons in both VA/VLo and VPLo tended to become more periodic and regular with a shift in oscillatory activity from low to high frequencies. Burst activity was reduced in VA/VLo, but was not significantly changed in VPLo. There was also a significant shift in the population of VA/VLo neurons that were inhibited during STN DBS, whereas VPLo neurons tended to be activated. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that STN DBS increases output from the nucleus and produces a change in the pattern and periodicity of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia thalamic network, and that these changes include cerebellar pathways likely via activation of adjacent cerebello-thalamic fiber bundles.", "pages": "823-30"}, {"volume": "110", "title": "Stimulation-induced parkinsonism after posteroventral deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus for craniocervical dystonia.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16198003", "authors": ["Constantoyannis, C", "Kagadis, GC", "Ellul, J", "Kefalopoulou, Z", "Chroni, E"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "The physiopathology of gait and balance disorders in Parkinson's disease patients is still poorly understood. Levodopa treatment and subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation improve step length and walking speed, with less effect on postural instability. These disorders have been linked to dysfunction of the descending basal ganglia outputs to brainstem structures. In this study, we evaluated the effects of stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), on locomotion and balance in Parkinson's disease patients. Biomechanical parameters and leg muscle activity were recorded during gait initiation in seven selected patients operated for bilateral STN stimulation, out of 204 stimulated patients, with one contact of each electrode located within the SNr. Step length, anteroposterior and vertical velocities of the centre of gravity were studied, with special reference to the subjects' ability to brake the centre of gravity fall before foot-contact, and compared to seven controls. In Parkinson's disease patients, five treatment conditions were tested: (i) no treatment, (ii) levodopa treatment, (iii) STN stimulation, (iv) SNr stimulation and (v) combined levodopa treatment and STN stimulation. The effects of these treatments on motor parkinsonian disability were assessed with the UPDRS III scale, separated into 'axial' (rising from chair, posture, postural stability and gait) and 'distal' scores. Whereas levodopa and/or STN stimulation improved 'axial' and 'distal' motor symptoms, SNr stimulation improved only the 'axial' symptoms. Compared to controls, untreated Parkinson's disease patients showed reduced step length and velocity, and poor braking just prior to foot-contact, with a decrease in both soleus (S) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscle activity. Step length and velocity significantly increased with levodopa treatment alone or in combination with STN stimulation in both natural and fast gait conditions, and with STN stimulation alone in the fast gait condition. Conversely, SNr stimulation had no significant effect on these measures in either condition. In the natural gait condition, no fall in the centre of gravity occurred as step length was low and active braking was unnecessary. In the fast gait condition, braking was improved with STN or SNr stimulation but not with levodopa treatment, with an increase in the stance leg S muscle activity. These results suggest that anteroposterior (length and velocity) and vertical (braking capacity) gait parameters are controlled by two distinct systems within the basal ganglia circuitry, representing respectively locomotion and balance.

Coherence and phase analysis between oscillatory spike trains and their oscillatory background were also conducted to study the phase relationship between the two. Of the 231 neuronal spike-trains which were sorted offline, 82 (35%) showed significant oscillatory activity.

More recently, the range of neuropsychiatric conditions and the possible target structures suitable for DBS have greatly increased.

In this article we argue that several of the target structures for DBS (nucleus accumbens, posterior inferior hypothalamus, nucleus subthalamicus, nuclei in the thalamus, globus pallidus internus, nucleus pedunculopontinus) are located at strategic positions within brain circuits related to motivational behaviors, learning, and motor regulation. Recording from DBS electrodes either during the operation or post-operatively from externalized leads while the patient is performing cognitive tasks tapping the functions of the respective circuits provides a new window on the brain mechanisms underlying these functions. This is exemplified by a study of a patient suffering from obsessive-compulsive disease from whom we recorded in a flanker task designed to assess action monitoring processes while he received a DBS electrode in the right nucleus accumbens. Clear error-related modulations were obtained from the target structure, demonstrating a role of the nucleus accumbens in action monitoring.

Finally, we review the results of neuropsychological and personality changes associated with anterior capsulotomy.", "pages": "823-30"}, {"volume": "128", "title": "[Neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms in Parkinson disease].", "issue": "18", "pmid": "11222807", "authors": ["Friedman, A", "Frankel, M", "Flaumenhaft, Y", "Merenlender, A", "Pinhasov, A", "Feder, Y", "Taler, M", "Gil-Ad, I", "Abeles, M", "Yadid, G"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Tidsskrift for den Norske l\u00e6geforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny r\u00e6kke", "abstract": "Clinical evidence of impaired arm swing while walking in patients with Parkinson's disease suggests that basal ganglia and related systems play an important part in the control of upper limb locomotor automatism. To gain more information on this supraspinal influence, we measured arm and thigh kinematics during walking in 10 Parkinson's disease patients, under four conditions: (i) baseline (no treatment), (ii) therapeutic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), (iii)L-DOPA medication and (iv) combined STN stimulation and L-DOPA. Ten age-matched controls provided reference data. Under baseline conditions the range of patients' arm motion was severely restricted, with no correlation with the excursion of the thigh. In addition, the arm swing was abnormally coupled in time with oscillation of the ipsilateral thigh. STN stimulation significantly increased the gait speed and improved the spatio-temporal parameters of arm and thigh motion. The kinematic changes as a function of gait speed changes, however, were significantly smaller for the upper than the lower limb, in contrast to healthy controls. Arm motion was also less responsive after L-DOPA. Simultaneous deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA had additive effects on thigh motion, but not on arm motion and arm-thigh coupling. The evidence that locomotor automatisms of the upper and lower limbs display uncorrelated impairment upon dysfunction of the basal ganglia, as well as different susceptibility to electrophysiological and pharmacological interventions, points to the presence of heterogeneously distributed, possibly partially independent, supraspinal control channels, whereby STN and dopaminergic systems have relatively weaker influence on the executive structures involved in the arm swing and preferential action on those for lower limb movements. These findings might be considered in the light of phylogenetic changes in supraspinal control of limb motion related to primate bipedalism.", "pages": "823-30"}, {"volume": "128", "title": "[Motor symptoms in Parkinson disease].", "issue": "18", "pmid": "11154099", "authors": ["Alberts, JL", "Voelcker-Rehage, C", "Hallahan, K", "Vitek, M", "Bamzai, R", "Vitek, JL"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Tidsskrift for den Norske l\u00e6geforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny r\u00e6kke", "abstract": "Stereotactic surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) can considerably improve appendicular motor signs, but their effect on axial motor signs--especially balance control under optimal drug therapy--remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation on levodopa-resistant axial and appendicular postural impairment in PD. Fourteen patients (11 with young-onset PD) and 18 age-matched controls were included. Patients were tested after intake of a suprathreshold levodopa dose, ensuring optimal response to drug therapy, and with stimulators both turned on and off. Balance control was assessed using multidirectional dynamic posturography. Outcome measures included full body kinematics and surface electromyography of paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Patients with stimulators turned off showed early decreased trunk roll with a loss of directional dependency, followed by increased and abnormally directed--i.e. destabilizing--trunk roll. Pelvis pitch motion showed decreased directional dependency in these patients. The abnormal trunk motion was not corrected by STN stimulation, but directional dependency of both trunk and pelvis motion partially improved, along with a general decrease in muscle activity. Even with stimulators off, protective arm movements were similar in the optimally treated patients and controls, indicating that these appendicular signs respond better to dopaminergic treatment than axial motor control. Our findings indicate that instability in PD results from a reduced flexibility of the trunk and pelvis that is largely resistant to STN stimulation combined with optimal drug treatment. These postural abnormalities are therefore likely associated with non-dopaminergic pathology. In contrast, protective arm movements did appear to be levodopa-responsive. Future studies should focus on identifying subgroups of optimal responders, particularly patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias.", "pages": "823-30"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Programmed acute electrical stimulation of ventral tegmental area alleviates depressive-like behavior.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "10552237", "authors": ["Malone, DA", "Dougherty, DD", "Rezai, AR", "Carpenter, LL", "Friehs, GM", "Eskandar, EN", "Rauch, SL", "Rasmussen, SA", "Machado, AG", "Kubu, CS", "Tyrka, AR", "Price, LH", "Stypulkowski, PH", "Giftakis, JE", "Rise, MT", "Malloy, PF", "Salloway, SP", "Greenberg, BD"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "abstract": "In recent years there have been several attempts to establish high frequency stimulation (HFS) as an additional treatment strategy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

A recent study reported that HFS as well as pharmacological inactivation of the STN alleviate compulsive checking in the quinpirole rat model of OCD. As the quinpirole model is based on a dopaminergic manipulation, the aim of the present study was to test whether HFS and pharmacological inactivation of the STN exert an anti-compulsive effect also in the drug-naive brain, using the signal attenuation rat model of OCD. The main finding of the present study is that both HFS and pharmacological inactivation of the STN exerted an anti-compulsive effect, although the two manipulations differed in their effects on other behavioral measures.

We describe, for the first time, the changes in activity of the subthlamic nucleus (STN) during different sleep stages in Parkinson's disease with special interest in the beta band. Ten patients with PD treated with deep brain stimulation of the STN were studied. Subthalamic local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded through the stimulation electrodes during wakefulness (\"off\" medication) and different sleep stages. In Stage 2 and slow-wave sleep, a significant decrease of beta activity was recorded. During REM sleep, beta power values were similar to wakefulness values or even higher.

Worsening of gait as a consequence of STN stimulation for PD has been described, but may be under-recognized in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of STN stimulation on gait relative to global outcome in a group of consecutively operated patients. For this purpose, we used a standardized patient questionnaire that asked about global outcome and specific effects on gait, as experienced both 6 months postoperatively and currently (at the time of completing the questionnaire; mean: 2.7 +/- 1.1 years). A delayed worsening of gait after bilateral STN stimulation was experienced by a considerable proportion of patients (42% of subjects, for gait in the OFF phase), and this was apparently relatively \"selective\" because their global outcome scores continued to be improved. These findings highlight the presence of a hitherto poorly recognized long-term complication of bilateral STN stimulation.

We focus on two classes of models: those that incorporate aspects of biological realism and constrained by functional principles, and more abstract mathematical models focusing on the higher level computational goals of the BG. While the former are arguably more \"realistic\", the latter have a complementary advantage in being able to describe functional principles of how the system works in a relatively simple set of equations, but are less suited to making specific hypotheses about the roles of specific nuclei and neurophysiological processes. We review the basic architecture and assumptions of these models, their relevance to our understanding of the neurobiological and cognitive functions of the BG, and provide an update on the potential roles of biological details not explicitly incorporated in existing models. Empirical studies ranging from those in transgenic mice to dopaminergic manipulation, deep brain stimulation, and genetics in humans largely support model predictions and provide the basis for further refinement.
