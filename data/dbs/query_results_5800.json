Neuronal responses to internally and externally generated sequential movements have been studied in the motor and premotor cortex of monkeys, but the involvement of subcortical motor structures such as the thalamus have not been studied in monkeys or humans. We examined the activity of neurons during a sequential button press task in motor thalamus of parkinsonian as well as chronic pain patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating electrodes. Single and dual microelectrode recordings were carried out during an internally generated task with a memorized sequence (MEM) and an externally driven task with the sequence given during task performance (follow). Average histograms of neuronal firing were constructed for each task and aligned with respect to visual cues (ready, go) or button presses (P1, P2, P3). Sequential movements were monitored with surface electromyography and hand accelerometry, and cell responses were divided into movement-defined epochs for ANOVA and post hoc means testing. Of 52 neurons tested, 31 were found to have task-related responses and 10 were task-selective with 4 responding preferentially to MEM and 7 responding preferentially to follow (1 was both). Complex responses were found including preparatory, delay period, and phase- and task-specific activity. These kinds of responses suggest a role of the thalamus in both internally and externally cued arms movement and provide some evidence for a role in sequential movements.", "pages": "1085-90"}, {"volume": "51", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "14570997", "authors": ["Panikar, D", "Kishore, A"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurology India", "abstract": "Dopaminergic replacement therapy with levodopa/carbidopa is still the cornerstone for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Recognition of the physiological changes in basal ganglia circuits in animal models of PD has provided the much-needed theoretic basis for targeting these areas. DBS of these areas has proven to be a safe procedure and effective against all the major motor symptoms of PD.

The surgical procedure was spectacularly efficient on tremor, but sometimes complications were not totally regressive and even more severe when surgery was bilateral, this leading to neurocognitive deficits or to speech problems. This, associated to the efficiency of levodopa, was at the origin of the almost total disappearance of this type of surgery during the '60s until the eighties. The rebirth of functional neurosurgery, necessitated by the appearance of dyskinesias, was possible in most part because of the development of techniques with a lower morbidity, such as high frequency stimulation (HFS). This was initially applied to the thalamic ventral intermedius nucleus VIM, and the low morbidity of the method has been demonstrated by the possibility to operate a large number of patients bilaterally without complication. The demonstration that the pallidal target, which had been abandoned during the '50s because of its low efficiency on the triad of symptoms of Parkinson's disease, was selectively efficient on dyskinesias, led naturally to apply HFS to this target. In 1990, the demonstration in the field of fundamental research of the role of the subthalamic nucleus as a key element of regulation of movement, suggested to register this nucleus into the list of targets, despite the risk of hemiballism that this structure presents when it is lesioned by haemorrhage, because of the good tolerance of HFS as a surgical method. This target quickly showed its remarkable efficiency on all symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Because of the reduction of the doses of dopaminergic treatments which were allowed, this target had also the capacity to reduce, indirectly, the intensity of dyskinesias. If the efficiency of the method is nowadays demonstrated as well as the stability on the long term of its results, the mechanism is still mostly not understood. Moreover the physiopathogenic hypothesis suggests the possibility of a neuroprotective effect of the stimulation, which still needs to be clearly established at the experimental level as well as at the level of clinical applications.", "pages": "1085-90"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Effect of deep brain stimulation of GPI on neuronal activity of the thalamic nucleus ventralis oralis in a dystonic patient.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "14568342", "authors": ["Pralong, E", "Debatisse, D", "Maeder, M", "Vingerhoets, F", "Ghika, J", "Villemure, JG"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "abstract": "The technique of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a preferred surgical choice for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.

HFS, consisting of trains of stimuli at a frequency of 100 Hz for 1 min, produced three types of synaptic plasticity in 17 STN neurons. First, HFS of the STN induced short-term potentiation (STP) of evoked postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude in four neurons. STP was associated with a reduction in the EPSC paired-pulse ratio, suggesting a presynaptic site of action. Second, HFS of the STN generated long-term potentiation (LTP) of EPSC amplitude in eight neurons. Although the EPSC paired-pulse ratio was reduced transiently in the first 2 min following HFS, ratios measured 6-20 min after HFS were unchanged from control. This suggests that LTP is maintained by a postsynaptic mechanism. Third, HFS produced long-term depression (LTD) of EPSC amplitude in five STN neurons. LTD was associated with a significant increase in EPSC paired-pulse ratios, indicating a presynaptic site of action. These results suggest that HFS can produce long-term changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission in the STN.

High frequency oscillations are generated both in deep axon segments of thalamo-cortical projection neurons and at the primary somatosensory cortex. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that HFOs might be more sensitive to temporal dispersion caused by demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) than the N20. The authors recorded HFOs in median nerve SSEPs in 50 patients with definite MS and in 30 healthy controls. Three patterns of SSEP alterations were found: (1) abolished HFOs with either normal (11% of stimulated limbs), or delayed N20 (16% of stimulated limbs); (2) an attenuation of N20 amplitude with preserved HFOs (13%); and (3) a mixture of both patterns (21%). The first pattern--normal N20 with abolished HFOs--indicates that the HFOs are a sensitive marker of slight demyelination. The second pattern is suggestive of a mainly axonal lesion type, while the third pattern points to a combined axonal/demyelinating process or a conduction block. Analysis of HFOs allows identification of slight demyelinating processes in MS patients in whom the N20 SSEP component remains unaffected.

To address this question, behavioral experiments were combined with lesions of dorsal thalamic nuclei and the midbrain torus semicircularis. Females were tested in two-alternative-forced-choice phonotactic experiments before and after a defined brain area was lesioned. During phonotactic tests, females had to choose between a \"standard\" synthetic call and one of three different variants, each of which had a single acoustic property (pulse rate, pulse rise-time, sound spectrum) that differed from the standard synthetic call. Results showed that dorsomedial thalamus lesions produced little or no effect on phonotaxis. In contrast, superficial and deep thalamus lesions, as well as lesions of the torus semicircularis, significantly decreased the number of phonotactic responses and increased the response time. Superficial thalamus lesions also abolished or reversed preferences for the standard call in the rise-time and sound spectrum tests. This effect is likely to have been caused by an imbalance in the stimulation of the thalamus by the low- and high-frequency pathways because these preferences were not affected in animals with more extensive lesions that included the superficial thalamus. Our data suggest that the torus semicircularis, but not the dorsal thalamus is crucial for phonotaxis in gravid, reproductively active females.

They have also been used to investigate brain function and have provided information about normal activity and pathogenesis. They have been used to investigate functional specialization in the brain and how specialized areas communicate to generate complex integrated functions such as speech, memory, the emotions and so on. The phenomenon of brain plasticity is poorly understood and yet clinical neurologists are aware, from everyday observations, that spontaneous recovery from brain lesions is common. An improved understanding of the mechanisms of recovery may generate new therapeutic strategies and indicate ways of modulating mechanisms that promote plastic compensation for loss of function. The main methods used to investigate these issues are positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.). M.R.I. is also used to map brain structure. The techniques of functional brain mapping and computational morphometrics depend on high performance scanners and a validated set of analytic statistical procedures that generate reproducible data and meaningful inferences from brain scanning data. The motor system presents a good paradigm to illustrate advances made by scanning towards an understanding of plasticity at the level of brain areas. The normal motor system is organized in a nested hierarchy. Recovery from paralysis caused by internal capsule strokes involves functional reorganization manifesting itself as changed patterns of activity in the component brain areas of the normal motor system. The pattern of plastic modification depends in part on patterns of residual or disturbed connectivity after brain injury. Therapeutic manipulations in patients with Parkinson's disease using deep brain stimulation, dopaminergic agents or fetal mesencephalic transplantation provide a means to examine mechanisms underpinning plastic change. Other models of plastic change, such as normal visuospatial learning or re-establishing speech comprehension after cochlear implantation in the deaf illustrate how patterns of brain function adapt over time.

The preoperative assessment, surgery, and discounted follow-up costs associated with subthalamic nucleus surgery were estimated at approximately UK Pounds 32,526 per patient over 5 years. Almost 70% of these costs are attributable to the initial costs of the equipment and the likely follow-up and replacement costs of the equipment. These costs will be affected mainly by future equipment costs and their replacement period and are relatively insensitive to preoperative assessment staff costs, length of hospital stay after surgery, and imaging costs. This cost estimate should be of use to researchers, health care managers, policy makers, and surgeons working in this area.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for complicated Parkinson's disease, but how DBS acts also remains unknown. The clinical benefit of DBS at frequencies >100 Hz suggests the possible importance of neural rhythms operating at frequencies higher than the range normally considered for basal ganglia processing (<100 Hz). The electrodes implanted for DBS also offer the opportunity to record neural activity from the human basal ganglia. This study aimed to assess whether oscillations at frequencies >100 Hz operate in the human STN. While recording local field potentials from the STN of nine patients with Parkinson's disease through DBS electrodes, we found a dopamine- and movement-dependent 300-Hz rhythm. At rest, and in the absence of dopaminergic medication, in most cases (eight out of 11 nuclei) the 100-1000 Hz band showed no consistent rhythm. Levodopa administration elicited (or markedly increased) a 300-Hz rhythm at rest [(mean +/- SD) central frequency: 319 +/- 33 Hz; bandwidth: 72 +/- 21 Hz; power increase (after medication - before medication)/before medication: 1.30 +/- 1.25; n = 11, P = 0.00098]. The 300-Hz rhythm was also increased by apomorphine, but not by orphenadrine. The 300-Hz rhythm was modulated by voluntary movement. Before levodopa administration, movement-related power increase in the 300-Hz rhythm was variably present in different subjects, whereas after levodopa it became a robust phenomenon [before 0.014 +/- 0.014 arbitrary units (AU), after 0.178 +/- 0.339 AU; n = 8, P = 0.0078]. The dopamine-dependent 300-Hz rhythm probably reflects a bistable compound nuclear activity and supports high-resolution information processing in the basal ganglia circuit. An absent 300-Hz subthalamic rhythm could be a pathophysiological clue in Parkinson's disease.

Successful lesions produced impaired treadmill walking behavior. High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the STN improved treadmill walking immediately and restored normal walking patterns. The same HFS failed to evoke visible side effects such as stepping, turning, raising of the head or facial muscle contraction in the absence of treadmill movement, or to change rotational behaviors elicited by the dopamine (DA) agonist apomorphine in unilateral lesioned rats. This suggests that the stimulation did not cause movement by an activation of brainstem locomotor regions or an increase attention leading to movement. Apomorphine-induced rotation may represent an imbalance of dopaminergic activation which remains during HFS. This work may provide a rodent model for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease, and be suitable for further investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS.", "pages": "1085-90"}, {"volume": "5", "title": "Alternative surgical procedures to help drug-resistant epilepsy - a review.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "12900734", "authors": ["Polkey, CE"], "year": "2003", "journal": "Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape", "abstract": "Intra-operative micro-electrode stimulation of sensorimotor thalamus produces paraesthesia or tingling in various body regions and is used to map somatotopy prior to implantation of deep brain-stimulating electrodes in awake patients. The neural elements affected by such microstimulation are unknown. Using paraesthesia as the behavioural-physiological response threshold, we measured chronaxie times for microstimuli applied to both somatosensory thalamic nuclei (cellular region) and its axonal afferents, the medial lemniscus. White matter chronaxie times were relatively unimodal, whereas two different clusters of chronaxie times were identified in grey matter: one corresponding to that of the medial lemniscus and the other about five times longer and compatible with that obtained from cell somata. Therefore, excitations of local axons and/or cell bodies can both contribute to the paraesthesia evoked during intra-operative thalamic mapping.", "pages": "1085-90"}, {"volume": "", "title": "Electrostimulation: a future treatment option for patients with neurogenic urodynamic disorders?", "issue": "109", "pmid": "12900733", "authors": ["Dalmose, A", "Bjarkam, C", "Vuckovic, A", "S\u00f8rensen, JC", "Hansen, J"], "year": "2003", "journal": "APMIS. Supplementum", "abstract": "Single-unit spinal recordings combined with application of glutamate into the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus were used to assess the action of this nucleus upon deep dorsal horn neurons in rats. Injection of high glutamate concentrations (10 and 100 mm) induced a dramatic and long-lasting increase of the responses of wide-dynamic range neurons to electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in the noxious range, without affecting ongoing discharges. Post-stimulus time histograms revealed that this increase concerned the post-discharge, but not A- or C-fibre-mediated responses, which remained unchanged independently of the stimulation frequency applied. The onset of the glutamate-induced response enhancement occurred with a concentration-dependent time delay and developed slowly until its maximum. These data indicate that the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus exerts a facilitating action upon deep dorsal horn wide-dynamic range neurons by enhancing their capacity to respond to peripheral stimulation through prolongation of their discharge. This action is accompanied by the strengthening of wind-up of deep dorsal horn wide-dynamic range neurons, hence providing a plausible substrate for chronic pain states. These results are in agreement with previous behavioural studies suggesting a pronociceptive role for the dorsal reticular nucleus [Almeida et al. (1996) Brain Res. Bull., 39, 7-15; Almeida et al. (1999) Eur. J. Neurosci., 11, 110-122], and support the involvement of a reverberating circuit, previously described in morphological studies [Almeida et al.

Many different stimulation targets and methods have been investigated. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is now approved for the treatment of refractory epilepsies by several governmental authorities in Europe and North America. However, it is mainly used as a palliative method when patients do not respond to medical treatment and epilepsy surgery is not possible. Numerous studies of the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on epileptic seizures have been performed and almost invariably report remarkable success. However, a limited number of controlled studies failed to show a significant effect. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) also was effective in open studies, and controlled studies are now being carried out. In addition, several uncontrolled reports describe successful treatment of refractory status epilepticus with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In summary, with the targets and stimulation parameters investigated so far, the effects of electrical brain stimulation on seizure frequency have been moderate at best.
