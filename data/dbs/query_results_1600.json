Its diagnosis is based on clinical characteristics. In dystonia, the pattern of abnormal posture or movement tends to be constant during the short term even if its severity fluctuates. This stereotypy often helps differentiate dystonia from psychogenic reaction. Dystonia may appear only during some specific task (task specificity) especially in its early phase, although it often becomes obscure during the long clinical course, resulting in persistent dystonic posture. Sensory trick or geste antagoniste means the change of severity triggered by some sensory input Overflow phenomenon is the activation of muscles unnecessary to a task, hampering purposeful movement. Symptoms tend to be milder in the morning, with large individual variation of its duration (morning benefit). Symptoms of dystonia may abruptly appear or disappear (flip-flop phenomenon). Cocontraction, believed as an essential feature of dystonia, reflects a loss of reciprocal inhibition of muscle activities, causing involuntary simultaneous contractions of agonists and antagonists. \"Negative dystonia,\" still an unaccepted feature of dystonia, is defined as non-paretic loss of central driving of muscle activities necessary to a task. Apraxia of lid opening/closure, paretic form of hand dystonia, dropped head syndrome, camptocormia, Pisa syndrome, cervical dystonia with limited range of head movement, or mandibular dystonia without cocontractions of masticatory muscles, can be explained with this concept at least in a subset of cases. Treatment of dystonia includes medication, botulinum toxin injection, intrathecal baclofen, surgical intervention, acupuncture and other alternative therapies, rehabilitation, and psychotherapy. Oral medication is usually an adjunct to more potent therapeutic options except for some specific indications like dopa-responsive dystonia.

The PPN is involved in initiation and modulation of gait and other stereotyped motor behaviors and is inter-connected with the pallido-thalamo-cortical circuit. Internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) DBS is effective at treating the motor signs associated with PD, however its impact on MRGPA is limited and its effect on PPN neuronal activity is unknown. The current work characterizes the effect of therapeutically-effective GPi DBS on PPN neuronal activity in a single rhesus monkey made parkinsonian using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). A scaled-down, quadripolar DBS lead was implanted into sensorimotor GPi under electrophysiological and stereotactic guidance. Single-neuron activity was recorded from PPN before, during and after DBS. GPi DBS reduced the mean discharge rate of PPN neurons from 16.8 Hz to 12.8 Hz, with 30 (66.7%) neurons showing a decreased mean rate, 3 (6.7%) increased and 12 (26.7%) unchanged. Consistent with known GABAergic projections from GPi to PPN, and with previous observations that stimulation increases output from the stimulated structure, GPi DBS suppressed activity in the PPN. The present observations, together with previous reports of improvement in MRGPA during low frequency stimulation in PPN, suggest that activation of PPN output may be required to improve MRGPA and may account for the lack of improvement in MRGPA typically observed with GPi or subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS.", "pages": "1033-6"}, {"volume": "231", "title": "Pallidal stimulation: effect of pattern and rate on bradykinesia in the non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16784412", "authors": ["Baker, KB", "Zhang, J", "Vitek, JL"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "abstract": "Hemichorea-hemiballism is a rare movement disorder that has various causes.

After resection of a craniopharyngioma in this patient at the age of 49 years, hemichorea-hemiballism developed, with a latency of several weeks. Because the patient was greatly impaired by the movement disorder, she underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus and the posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus. Although both pallidal and thalamic stimulation could suppress the movement disorder, the voltage needed was clearly less with thalamic than with pallidal stimulation. At the last available follow-up 25 months postoperatively, complete subsidence of hemichorea-hemiballism was achieved with long-term thalamic stimulation. Long-term DBS therapy is an efficient treatment modality for refractory hemichorea-hemiballism in the long run (> 2 years).

Recently, reversible invasive stimulation methods, i.e. vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been introduced into the management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). VNS has already received regulatory approval for TRD. This paper reviews the available clinical evidence and neurobiology of VNS and DBS in TRD. The principle of VNS is a stimulation of the left cervical vagus nerve with a programmable neurostimulator. VNS was examined in 4 clinical trials with 355 patients. VNS demonstrated steadily increasing improvement with full benefit after 6-12 months, sustained up to 2 years. Patients who responded best had a low-to-moderate antidepressant resistance. However, the primary results of the only controlled trial were negative. DBS involves stereotactical implantation of electrodes powered by a pulse generator into the specific brain regions. For depression, the targeted areas are the subthalamic nucleus, internal globus pallidus, ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum, the subgenual cingulated region, and the nucleus accumbens. Antidepressant effects of DBS were examined in case series with a total number of 50 TRD patients. Stimulation of different brain regions resulted in a reduction of depressive symptoms. The clinical data on the use of VNS and DBS in TRD are encouraging. The major contribution of the methods is a novel approach that allows for precise targeting of the specific brain areas, nuclei and circuits implicated in the etiopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. For clinical practice, it is necessary to identify patients who may best benefit from VNS or DBS.", "pages": "1033-6"}, {"volume": "259", "title": "Successful subthalamic stimulation in genetic Parkinson's disease caused by duplication of the \u03b1-synuclein gene.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18323759", "authors": ["Antonini, A", "Pilleri, M", "Padoan, A", "Landi, A", "Ferla, S", "Biundo, R", "D'Avella, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "The precise localizations of the neural substrates of voluntary inhibition are still debated.

Some groups apply indirect methods involving anatomical landmarks, or atlases incorporating anatomical or functional data. Others perform direct visualization on MR imaging, using T2-weighted spin echo or inversion recovery protocols. The combined studies do not offer a straightforward conclusion on the best targeting protocol. Indirect methods are not patient specific, leading to varying results between cases. On the other hand, direct targeting on MR imaging suffers from lack of contrast within the subthalamic region, resulting in a poor delineation of the STN. These deficiencies result in a need for intraoperative adaptation of the original target based on test stimulation with or without microelectrode recording. It is expected that future advances in MR imaging technology will lead to improvements in direct targeting.

Twenty PD patients (all men; mean age \u00b1 SD, 58.3 \u00b1 6 years) in bilateral STN DBS switched ON and OFF conditions and 18 matched controls rated pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System according to emotional valence (unpleasantness/pleasantness) and arousal on 2 independent visual scales ranging from 1 to 9. Eighty-four pictures depicting primary rewarding (erotica and food) and aversive fearful (victims and threat) and neutral stimuli were selected for this study. In the STN DBS ON condition, the PD patients attributed lower valence scores to the aversive pictures compared with the OFF condition (P < .01) and compared with controls (P < .01). The difference between the OFF condition and controls was less pronounced (P < .05). Furthermore, postoperative weight gain correlated with arousal ratings from the food pictures in the STN DBS ON condition (P < .05 compensated for OFF condition).

In addition, this perspective article will outline the importance of capturing broader aspects of \"outcome\" or benefits as compared to those traditional clinical measures used. The key message is the importance of employing a broad \"perspective\" on the measurement and valuation of costs and benefits as well as the importance of adopting the appropriate time horizon for evaluating the costs and benefits of DBS.

We investigated in this paper the feasibility of using a model-based approach to the analysis and control of a basal ganglia (BG) network model of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) spiking neurons through microstimulation. Detailed analysis of this network model suggests that it can reproduce the experimentally observed characteristics of BG neurons under a normal and a pathological Parkinsonian state. A simplified neuronal firing rate model, identified from the detailed HH network model, is shown to capture the essential network dynamics. Mathematical analysis of the simplified model reveals the presence of a systematic relationship between the network's structure and its dynamic response to spatiotemporally patterned microstimulation. We show that both the network synaptic organization and the local mechanism of microstimulation can impose tight constraints on the possible spatiotemporal firing patterns that can be generated by the microstimulated network, which may hinder the effectiveness of microstimulation to achieve a desired objective under certain conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that the feedback control design aided by the mathematical analysis of the simplified model is indeed effective in driving the BG network in the normal and Parskinsonian states to follow a prescribed spatiotemporal firing pattern. We further show that the rhythmic/oscillatory patterns that characterize a dopamine-depleted BG network can be suppressed as a direct consequence of controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of a subpopulation of the output Globus Pallidus internalis (GPi) neurons in the network.
