Stimulation of the globus pallidus produced a marked contraversive circling behavior, while stimulation of the striatum led only to contraversive head turning. Unilateral stimulation of the striatum increased LCGU bilaterally in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars compacta, but only ipsilaterally in the entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and subthalamic nucleus. Similar stimulation of the globus pallidus increased LGCU in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, deep layers of the superior colliculus and pedunculopontine nucleus, exclusively on the ipsilateral side. These results indicate that the electrical stimulation induces LCGU changes in the respective structures having both monosynaptic and transsynaptic neuronal inputs. Some changes may also be mediated by antidromic activation. They also suggest that activation of a synaptic process whether excitatory or inhibitory results in increases in LCGU.

We have studied the functional and somatotopic properties of 531 single mechanoreceptive thalamic neurons in humans undergoing stereotactic surgery for the control of movement disorders and pain. The majority of these somatosensory cells had small receptive fields (RFs) and were activated in a reproducible manner by mechanical stimuli applied to the skin or deep tissues. These neurons, which we termed \"lemniscal,\" could be further classified into those responding to stimulation of cutaneous (76% of lemniscal sensory cells) or deep (24%) structures. 2. The incidence of neurons having cutaneous or mucosal RFs in the perioral region, thumb, and fingers (66%) was much higher than that of neurons having RFs elsewhere on the body. Most of the deep cells were activated by movements of and/or mechanical stimuli delivered to muscles or tendons controlling the elbow, wrist, and fingers. 3. Sequences of cells spanning several millimeters in the parasagittal plane often exhibited overlapping RFs. However, RFs changed markedly for cells separated by the same distances in the mediolateral direction. This suggests that the cutaneous somatotopic representation of each region of the body is organized into relatively thin sheets of cells oriented in the parasagittal plane. 4. By comparing neuronal RFs in different parasagittal planes in thalamus of individual patients we have identified a mediolateral representation of body surface following the sequence from: intraoral structures, face, thumb through fifth finger to palm, with forearm and leg laterally. 5. Along many trajectories in the parasagittal plane the sequence of cells with overlapping RFs was interrupted by another sequence of cells with RFs corresponding to a different body region. The RFs of the intervening sequence characteristically represented body regions known to be located more medially in thalamus (see 3 above). These findings could be explained if the lamellae postulated above were laterally convex. 6. Cells responding to deep stimulation (deep cells) could be further classified into those responding to joint movement (63%), deep pressure (15%), or both (22%). Deep cells were found usually at the anterior-dorsal border and sometimes at the posterior border of the region containing cells responding to cutaneous stimuli.

The main regions that gave defensive behaviour were (i) rostromedial superior colliculus (all layers), and (ii) both medial and lateral parts of the caudal deep layers. Cells in these areas project into the ipsilateral descending pathway. However, the cells of origin of this pathway are also found in collicular regions, such as rostral intermediate gray and parts of far caudal colliculus, that did not give defensive movements in response to glutamate stimulation. It is unclear whether this is because only parts of the ipsilateral pathway mediate defensive behaviours, or because glutamate is a relatively inefficient stimulating agent for these systems. An unexpected feature of the results was that at a number of collicular sites the nature of the defensive response changed with successive (up to three) injections of glutamate, often appearing to become more intense.

A variety of evidence suggests that this tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway may mediate the orienting movements that can be evoked by tectal stimulation. However, we have recently found that orienting head movements can still be obtained in rats after section of the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway, implying that additional pathways are also involved. The present study sought to test this implication, by taking advantage of the fact that in rats the cells of origin of the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway are largely segregated within the lateral part of the stratum album intermediate. It is thus possible to find out whether orienting head movements can be produced by a cell-excitant from tectal regions that contain few cells of origin of the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. Hooded rats in an open field were filmed during microinjections of sodium L-glutamate (50 mM, 200 nl) into the superior colliculus, and the films analysed for the appearance of contralaterally directed movements of the head and body. Subsequent histological reconstruction of the injection sites indicated that such movements could be obtained from widespread areas within the superior colliculus, including not only lateral stratum album intermediale but also the deep layers, and parts of the medial superficial and intermediate layers. Moreover, sites in or close to lateral stratum album intermediate often gave circling movements with downward pointing head, whereas some sites outside lateral stratum album intermediale gave sustained immobility with the head pointing contralaterally and upwards. This evidence supports the view that tectal efferent pathways besides the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway are involved in the control of head movement. In addition, at least some of these pathways are not collaterals of the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway, since the movements were obtained from collicular regions with few tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway cells. Finally, the results are consistent with the view that different collicular output pathways mediate movements that have different functions.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "439", "title": "The inhibitory effect of somatic inputs on the excitatory responses of vagal cardiomotor neurones to stimulation of the nucleus tractus solitarius in rabbits.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "3359194", "authors": ["Wang, QA", "Guo, XQ", "Li, P"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Brain research", "abstract": "Experiments were done in 41 rabbits anaesthetized with urethane and chloralose, paralyzed with Flaxedil and ventilated artificially.

The IPSP from SC stimulation was proposed to be mediated by the recurrent inhibitory circuit to LGN, since the recurrent inhibitory interneurones in the thalamic reticular nucleus (R) responded to the same stimulation with a latency of 2.14 +/- 0.43 ms, which was 1.73 ms shorter than the latency of the IPSP in LGN relay cells. This was in good agreement with our previous observation that the recurrent interneurones always fired about 1.8 ms prior to the onset of the recurrent IPSP in LGN (Lo and Xie 1987b). The recurrent inhibitory interneurones could also be excited by stimulation of the central lateral nucleus (CL) with a very short latency (0.57 +/- 0.15 ms), suggesting a monosynaptic connection between the central lateral nucleus and the reticular recurrent interneurones. This suggestion was supported by the fact that CL neurones, which projected to the striate cortex (Cx), were antidromically excited by stimulation of the caudal part of R where the recurrent inhibitory interneurones were situated. CL neurone's response to stimulation of the deep layers of SC (SC-CL response) has a latency of 1.68 +/- 0.56 ms, which was comparable with the difference between the latency of SC-R response and that of CL-R response, just as expected from the notion that the saccadic suppression is mediated by a circuit of SC (deep layers) -CL-R-LGN.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "66 Suppl 14", "title": "[Evoked potentials and intravenous anesthetics].", "issue": "", "pmid": "3292821", "authors": ["Kochs, E", "Schulte am Esch, J"], "year": "1988", "journal": "Klinische Wochenschrift", "abstract": "In contrast to the electroencephalogram, which is a collection of the spontaneous brain electrical potentials generated by the cerebral cortex, evoked potentials are the electrical signals generated by the nervous system in response to brief extrinsic sensory stimuli.

Moreover they prove useful to define the anatomical level of lesions in the afferent pathway tested. They have been successfully applied during anesthesia and operations when pathways amenable to evoked potential recording were at risk. The most practical techniques in common intraoperative evoked response monitoring involve stimulation of visual, auditory and somatosensory pathways.

The potential application of evoked responses to monitor depth of anesthesia has been demonstrated by several groups. In contrast to visual, auditory and somatosensory cortical evoked potentials which show a large inter- and intraindividual variance acoustical evoked brainstem and somatosensory evoked subcortical potentials are very robust under general anesthesia. Drug-induced effects on shape, amplitude and latencies of evoked responses during balanced anesthesia must be well documented in order to establish evoked responses as sensitive indicators of systemic problems that may threaten the viability of the central nervous system.

Electrical stimulation (10 sec trains of 0.3 msec 100 Hz cathodal pulses, 50 microA) within the superficial and intermediate layers of the rostral superior colliculus transiently lowered blood pressure without affecting heart rate.

Electrolytic lesions (n = 7) or large heat lesions of the amygdala (n = 5) or electrolytic lesions of the medial septum (n = 10) were not successful in suppressing the 2 degrees hippocampal AD. However, 4 rats with radiofrequency lesion and 3 rats with bilateral aspiration lesion of the entorhinal cortex had diminished or no 2 degrees hippocampal AD. The fast waves after tetanization were reversed 180 degrees across surface and deep CA1 electrodes. The fast wave increase was blocked by atropine sulfate (25-50 mg/kg i.p.), scopolamine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg i.p.) and medial septal lesions. It was concluded that the 2 degrees hippocampal AD may depend on a reverberation of neural circuitry involving the entorhinal cortex. The 2 degrees AD recorded from amygdala electrodes may partly reflect spreading of activities from the entorhinal cortex. On the other hand, the increase in fast waves after tetanization requires an intact septohippocampal, muscarinic cholinergic input, and may depend on an enhanced cholinergic input or an increased response.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "58", "title": "Characteristics of spinoreticular and spinothalamic neurons with renal input.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "3655878", "authors": ["Ammons, WS"], "year": "1987", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Spinoreticular (SRT) and spinothalamic (STT) neurons were studied for responses to renal and somatic stimuli in 34 cats that were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose.

Collision tests showed that activation from two electrodes resulted from stimulation of separate axonal branches and not from current spread. Twenty STT cells were activated from the spinothalamic tract just medial to the medial geniculate nucleus. SRT cells were located in laminae I, V, VII, and VIII of the T12-L2 segments. Most cells were located in lamina VII. STT cells were found in laminae I, V, and VII. The axons of 12 SRT cells were located in the ventrolateral or ventral quadrants of the upper cervical spinal cord. Antidromic conduction velocities of SRT cells averaged 48.7 +/- 3.7 m/s. No differences in conduction velocity were found between cells projecting to different reticular sites. In addition conduction velocity did not vary with the type of somatic or renal input. Antidromic conduction velocities of STT cells averaged 46.4 +/- 4.7 m/s. Renal nerve stimulation excited 58 and inhibited 3 SRT cells. All 20 STT cells were excited. Thirty SRT cells were excited only by A-delta input, 26 received both A-delta- and C-fiber inputs, and 2 cells received only C-fiber input. Ten STT cells received A-delta input only and 10 received both A-delta- and C-fiber inputs. All cells with renal input also received somatic input. Thirty-six SRT cells (59%) were classified as high threshold, 12 (20%) as wide dynamic range, and 10 (16%) as deep. Ten STT cells were classified as high threshold and 10 as wide dynamic range. Somatic receptive fields of STT cells were usually simple and invariably included the left flank region, although many of the fields extended to the left hindlimb or abdomen. Eighteen of the 20 were restricted to the ipsilateral side. In contrast, somatic receptive fields of SRT cells were primarily bilateral (71%). While all but two receptive fields included the left flank area, most extended to one or both hindlimbs, the abdomen, or the right flank.

The peak of labeling in the flocculus was greater than any other peak of labeling measured in the cerebellum of MRF-stimulated or control rats. Structures showing significant decreases in 2-DG uptake included the 3 deep cerebellar nuclei and the 3 vestibular nuclei. The most pronounced suppressive effects of MRF stimulation were on the medial and lateral vestibular nuclei. The changes in metabolic activity revealed by 2-DG provide a first anatomical demonstration of: the activating effects of MRF stimulation on the flocculus; and the suppressive effects of MRF stimulation on deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. The observed patterns of metabolic activation and suppression were correlated with the known electrophysiological properties of the structures affected by MRF stimulation. The findings are consistent with specific effects of MRF stimulation on floccular-vestibular-visual interactions that may be disruptive to learning functions such as adaptability of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The effects of MRF stimulation on the deep cerebellar nuclei are also consistent with a potential disruption of somatomotor learning-related activities in these nuclei.

Three different wave patterns were discerned in the cingulate EEG. Irregular slow waves occurred during grooming, drinking, eating (Type II behavior) and slow-wave sleep (SWS). The irregular waves also contained sharp transients of about 20 ms duration called EEG-spikes. EEG-spikes reversed their polarity within the cingulate cortex and correlated with an increase in cingulate MUA. They were probably generated by deep (layer IV to VI) neurons in the cingulate cortex. Theta rhythm of 6-10 Hz accompanied walking, rearing, postural shifts, head movements (Type I behavior) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). MUA of low-amplitude units was phase-locked to the local theta waves, suggesting local generation of the slow waves. However, volume-conduction from the hippocampus would likely contribute to the cingulate theta since no reversal of the theta waves was found in the cingulate cortex. Fast waves of greater than 30 Hz were generally larger during Type I than during Type II behavior. Cellular generators for fast waves are not known. High-amplitude (greater than 100 microV) MUA only appeared during Type II behavior, and in particular during SWS. During REMS, these units were silent. Stimulation of the contralateral homotopic cingulate cortex gave antidromic and synaptic components in the average evoked potential (AEP).

Cutaneous receptive fields were classified as \"low threshold\" (cells excited best by innocuous intensities of mechanical stimulation), \"wide dynamic range\" (cells activated by weak mechanical stimuli, but the best responses were to noxious stimuli) or high threshold (innocuous stimuli had little effect, but noxious mechanical stimuli produced a vigorous discharge).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "66", "title": "The cerebellar corticonuclear projection from lobule Vb/c of the cat anterior lobe: a combined electrophysiological and autoradiographic study.

The c1 and c3 olivocerebellar zones, which are known to receive climbing fibre input transmitted from the ipsilateral forelimb via a dorsal funiculus spino-olivo-cerebellar pathway (DF-SOCP), were found to project to partially overlapping regions within nucleus interpositus anterior (NIA). No projection to nucleus interpositus posterior (NIP) was demonstrated for either zone. No distinction could be seen between the terminal fields for the medial and lateral halves of the c1 zone which are, however, known to receive their climbing fibre input from quite separate regions within the inferior olive.

Their destruction in Parkinsonian patients and experimentally lesioned animals leads to a reduction and slowing of movements as well as other motor, cognitive, and motivational deficits. We tested the responses of DA neurons to somatosensory stimulation to gain insight into the nature of peripheral information reaching these neurons. Experiments were performed as repeated sessions in two anesthetized monkeys having chronically implanted recording chambers, thereby reducing the number of primates required for experimentation. Midbrain DA neurons were characterized by their histological location, by the form, duration, and frequency of extracellularly recorded, spontaneously occurring impulses, by antidromic activation from caudate and putamen, and by the reduction of impulse rate following systemic administration of low doses of the DA autoreceptor agonist apomorphine. Half of the midbrain DA neurons (65 of 145 neurons, 45%) were antidromically activated from chronically implanted stimulating electrodes in caudate (35 neurons), putamen (47 neurons), or both structures (17 of them). Conduction velocities ranged from 0.7 to 2.5 m/s, with medians of 1.2 and 1.5 m/s for neurons projecting to caudate and putamen, respectively. Half of the midbrain DA neurons were depressed (72 of 140 neurons, 51%) and less than a quarter activated (24 of 140 neurons, 17%) by intense noxious pinch stimulation to the body surface. Innocuous, even intense, surface or deep somatosensory stimuli were ineffective. Pinch responses continued during the whole stimulating period of several seconds in most DA neurons. There was no response habituation during repeated stimulation. Convergence between spinal and trigeminal input and from both body sides was seen for virtually all noxious pinch responses. Thus DA neurons typically responded in the same direction to pinch stimulation of hand, foot, face, tail, and dorsum of both sides. Systemic administration of the DA receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.33 or 0.50 mg/kg) strongly reduced pinch responses in all seven DA neurons tested. This provides evidence for an involvement of DAergic neurotransmission in the representation of exteroceptive input in the brain. The results show that midbrain DA neurons projecting to the striatum respond to noxious somatosensory input in the anesthetized monkey. The bilateral nontopographic nature of the responses does not support a role in precise stimulus recognition, rather it suggests a mechanism involved in basic neuronal processes underlying behavioral responsiveness.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "65", "title": "Difference in projections to the lateral and medial facial nucleus: anatomically separate pathways for rhythmical vibrissa movement in rats.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "3556466", "authors": ["Isokawa-Akesson, M", "Komisaruk, BR"], "year": "1987", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

In order to study brain projections to facial nucleus, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected iontophoretically into the entire facial nucleus or the following subdivisions: lateral, dorsolateral, medial, intermediate, and ventral. In the mesencephalic region, the retrorubral nucleus was found to project to the contralateral medial subdivision of NVII, while the red nucleus was found to project to the contralateral lateral subdivision of NVII. Other mesencephalic projections to the facial nucleus arose from the deep mesencephalic nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, central gray including interstitial nucleus of Cajal and nucleus Darkschewitsch, superior colliculus and substantia nigra (reticular). In the mesencephalic region, the K\u00f6lliker-Fuse nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus projected mainly to the ipsilateral lateral subdivision of NVII. In addition, the trapezoid, pontine reticular, vestibular, and motor trigeminal nuclei were observed to have predominantly ipsilateral connections to the facial nucleus. In contrast, projections from the myelencephalic region were to both the lateral and medial subdivision of NVII. The medullary reticular nucleus, ambiguus nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus and parvocellular reticular nucleus projected to both lateral and medial subdivisions of NVII with an ipsilateral predominance. The gigantocellular and paragigantocellular reticular nuclei, raphe magnus, external cuneate nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract also projected to the facial motor nucleus. Surprisingly, no direct projections to the NVII were observed from diencephalic and telencephalic regions. Our findings that the lateral subdivision of NVII which innervates vibrissa-pad-muscles (Dom et al. 1973; Martin and Lodge 1977; Watson et al. 1982) receives different metencephalic and mesencephalic projections than medial subdivision which controls pinna movement (Henkel and Edwards 1978), suggest that the functional difference between these subdivisions is mediated by the anatomically separate pathways.

Many of the results obtained in a previous study using similar techniques (Landry and Desch\u00eanes 1981) were confirmed by the present experiments. Fibers activated by cutaneous stimulation arborized either in area 3b or 1 but some did send branches to both areas. Also, the intracortical arborization of a rapidly adapting cutaneous afferent fiber in area 2 is described. The size and tangential extent of the fiber in area 2 are similar to those arborizing in other areas of the primary somatosensory cortex and consist of multiple patches separated by uninvaded gaps. One fiber activated by stimulation of deep tissue receptors gave rise to two bushes that arborized along a rostrocaudal axis exclusively in area 3b. Terminal boutons and varicosities were found mostly in layers VI, IV, the bottom third of III and the upper portion of V, but some fibers did send a few collateral branches to layer II and the bottom part of layer I. The results suggest that in the forebrain representation, the same modality and submodality can be recorded in more that one cytoarchitectonic area but that areas 3b, 1 and 2 should not be considered as a single functionally homogeneous area. Counts of terminals suggest that a single fiber arborizing in area 1 makes as many as 3 times the number of synapses made in area 2 or 3b. Since fibers appear to be modality and submodality specific, if convergence of modality, submodality and/or body areas occur in the cortex, then this must be preferentially, but not exclusively, done by thalamic fibers of different functions which arborize in the same cytoarchitectonic area and synapse upon a shared postsynaptic target.

This test measures conditioned fear by an increase in the amplitude of a simple reflex (the acoustic startle reflex) in the presence of a cue previously paired with a shock. This paradigm offers a number of advantages as an alternative to most animal tests of fear or anxiety because it involves no operant and is reflected by an enhancement rather than a suppression of ongoing behavior. Fear-potentiated startle is selectively decreased by drugs such as diazepam, morphine, and buspirone that reduce fear or anxiety clinically. Electrical stimulation techniques suggest that a visual conditioned stimulus ultimately alters acoustic startle at a specific point along the acoustic startle pathway. Relevant visual structures implicated in potentiated startle include the lateral geniculate nucleus, visual cortex, and deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus. The central nucleus of the amygdala and the caudal branch of the ventral amygdalofugal pathway projecting to or through the substantia nigra are also necessary for potentiated startle to occur. Electrical stimulation of the central nucleus of the amygdala markedly increases acoustic startle. By combining these behavioral, anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological approaches, it should soon be possible to determine each neural pathway that is required for a stimulus signaling fear to alter startle behavior.

In the present study, neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) were used as a model to examine how single neurons deal with simultaneous cues from different sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, somatosensory). The functional result of multisensory convergence on an individual cell was determined by comparing the responses evoked from it by a combined-modality (multimodal) stimulus with those elicited by each (unimodal) component of that stimulus presented alone. Superior colliculus cells exhibited profound changes in their activity when individual sensory stimuli were combined. These \"multisensory interactions\" were found to be widespread among deep laminae cells and fell into one of two functional categories: response enhancement, characterized by a significant increase in the number of discharges evoked; and response depression, characterized by a significant decrease in the discharges elicited. Multisensory response interactions most often reflected a multiplicative, rather than summative, change in activity. Their absolute magnitude varied from cell to cell and, when stimulus conditions were altered, within the same cell. However, the percentage change of enhanced interactions was generally inversely related to the vigor of the responses that could be evoked by presenting each unimodal stimulus alone and suggest that the potential for response amplification was greatest when responses evoked by individual stimuli were weakest. The majority of cells exhibiting multi-sensory characteristics were demonstrated to have descending efferent projections and thus had access to premotor and motor areas of the brain stem and spinal cord involved in SC-mediated attentive and orientation behaviors.

Ten responded only to deflection of one or more vibrissae. Six cells were activated by guard hair movement only, six by deflection of guard hairs or vibrissa(e), and seven by pinch of facial skin with serrated forceps. Different classes of low-threshold cells could not be distinguished on the basis of their somadendritic morphologies or laminar distribution. Neurons activated by multiple vibrissae were unique, however, in that one sent its axon into the medial lemniscus, and three projected into the trigeminal spinal tract. None of the guard hair-only or vibrissae-plus-guard hair neurons had such projections. Cells that responded best to noxious stimulation were located mainly in laminae I, II, and deep V, while neurons activated by vibrissa(e) and/or guard hair deflection were located in layers III, IV, and superficial V. Low-threshold neurons generally had fairly thick dendrites with few spines, whereas high-threshold cells tended to have thinner dendrites with numerous spines. Moreover, the dendritic arbors of low-threshold cells were, for the most part, denser than those of the noxious cells. Neurons with mandibular receptive fields were located in the dorsomedial portion of the MDH; cells with ophthalmic fields were found in the ventrolateral MDH, and maxillary cells were interposed. Cells sensitive to deflection of dorsal mystacial vibrissae and/or guard hairs were located ventral to those activated by more ventral hairs. Neurons with rostral receptive fields were found in the rostral MDH, while cells activated by hairs of the caudal mystacial pad, periauricular, and periorbital regions were located in the caudal MDH. Receptive-field types were encountered that have not been reported for trigeminal primary afferent neurons: multiple vibrissae; vibrissae plus guard hairs; and wide dynamic range. The latter two can be explained by the convergence of different primary afferent types onto individual neurons. Our failure to find a significant relationship between dendritic area (in the transverse plane) and the number of vibrissae suggests that primary afferent convergence may not be responsible for the synthesis of the multiple vibrissae receptive field. Excitatory connections between MDH neurons may, therefore, account for multiple vibrissae receptive fields in the MDH.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Structure-function relationships in rat medullary and cervical dorsal horns.

The following was found: The thenar stimulus evoked four main SEP components which were seen over wide regions of postcentral gyrus: P1 at 12 ms, the primary evoked response; P1a, near 20 ms; N1, near 50 ms; and P2, around 120 ms after the stimulus. MUA was observed during the P1, P1a and N1 temporal intervals whose vigor changed as a function of the respective SEP component's amplitude. CSD analysis showed that during P1 a current sink and source appeared within the middle and superficial cortical layers, respectively. During P1a, a sink just above that of P1 and a superficial source became evident. During N1, a large superficial sink and one or two deep sources appeared. Evoked MUA during P1 and P1a was most prominent at the level of their current sinks while MUA during N1 appeared at the level of the current sources, in general. When stimulation was moved from the thenar portion of the hand to a region which most closely matched the receptive field of the cortical recording site, P1 and P1a increased amplitude while N1 both increased in amplitude and decreased in peak latency. Also, MUA activity during the early temporal intervals become more vigorous. These changes were similar to those observed with thenar stimuli as the recording site approached the thenar cortical representation. Over repeated trials at a single stimulus intensity, the spontaneous changes in SEP amplitude were found to be directly correlated with MUA and CSD measures within the same temporal interval. In contrast, SEP, MUA or CSD measures within the early temporal intervals (i.e., P1 or P1a) were uncorrelated or less frequently, inversely correlated with the same measures in the late temporal interval (i.e. N1).

Forty-nine neurones were allocated to the main cuneate nucleus. They occupied the pars triangularis which surrounds the pars rotunda laterally and ventrally. Fifty-six units were classified as external cuneate neurones. Among the external cuneate neurones, 14 neurones were excited antidromically by cerebellar and 8 neurones by thalamic stimulation; two further units responded antidromically to both cerebellar and thalamic stimulation. This observation is in agreement with previous anatomical evidence that part of the external cuneate neurones project to the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus. Possibly, some of these neurones may have bifurcating axons projecting to both targets. More than half of the main cuneate neurones were antidromically excited from the thalamus; three units were backfired from the cerebellum and two units were backfired from both targets. With controlled longitudinal displacements of the extensor digitorum communis tendon, the response patterns of the proprioceptive neurones were similar in both nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Neuronal responses of medullary relay cells to controlled stretches of forearm muscles in the monkey.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "4094699", "authors": ["Hummelsheim, H", "Wiesendanger, M"], "year": "1985", "journal": "Neuroscience", "abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system is hierarchically organized. At the bottom of this organization are the sympathetic pre-post-ganglionic channels which supply the autonomic target organs, at the top the hypothalamus and cortical structures. Each level of this hierarchy contains neuronal programmes which govern the sympathetic activity in a patterned fashion. According to this hierarchy the reactions to noxious, tissue-damaging events, which are organized by the hypothalamus and suprahypothalamic brain structures, are of a more general character than those organized by the spinal cord, these being of a more specific character. The spinal cord is probably much more important than hitherto believed for integration and in determining the characteristic discharge patterns of the sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurones. The defence reaction is described as a general reaction to noxious stimuli. Its sympathetic components consist of the patterns of discharge in sympathetic neurones supplying skin, skeletal muscle, viscera and adrenal medulla. It is organized in the hypothalamus and upper brain stem. The spinal cord integrates more specific somato-sympathetic, viscero-sympathetic and viscero-visceral reactions to noxious stimuli which are of a protective character. Visceral thoraco-lumbar afferents in 'sympathetic' nerves innervate visceral organs in the pelvic abdominal and thoracic cavities. Some innervate deep somatic structures of the ventral compartment of the vertebral column. No conclusive experimental evidence exists to show that they innervate skin and deep tissues of the extremities. Noxious events in the visceral domain are encoded by these visceral afferents. However, no convincing experimental evidence exists to show that this occurs by 'specific' visceral nociceptive afferents. It may well be that visceral noxious events are encoded by the intensity of the discharges in these neurones. No conclusive experimental evidence exists to show that peripheral nociceptors are controlled by activity in sympathetic post-ganglionic neurones. In certain pathophysiological situations, however, it may happen that activity in sympathetic post-ganglionic neurones, which supply an extremity, leads to excitation of afferent axons, thus establishing a vicious circle between primary afferent neurones, spinal cord and sympathetic outflow. This situation may occur after partial lesions of peripheral nerves in a syndrome which is called 'reflex sympathetic dystrophy'.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "2", "title": "Systemic and specific autonomic reactions in pain: efferent, afferent and endocrine components.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "3910427", "authors": ["J\u00e4nig, W"], "year": "1985", "journal": "European journal of anaesthesiology", "abstract": "Effects of local cooling of the neocortical zone around stimulating microelectrode upon thresholds of initiation of vibrissal motor responses to intracortical microstimulation were studied in alert rabbits.

The recordings were obtained from 7 to 23 months postoperatively (early regeneration). Three types of mechanoreceptive afferents (RA, SAI, SAII) and many deep units of unknown origin were found. No regenerated PC units could be identified. The reinnervated receptors were predominantly located in the palm and proximal fingers, comparable to those found 3 years or more postoperatively (late regeneration). Response thresholds and in general, discharge and receptive field characteristics of the majority of afferents were largely comparable to late regeneration and normal. The properties of SAII units were like normal in all respects. However, several distinct abnormalities were encountered early during regeneration: multiple receptive fields innervated by a single afferent (2/9 RA and 2/9 SAI), unusually small or large receptive fields (RA and SAI), pronounced fatigue on repetitive stimulation (7/15 SAI, 4/6 deep). Responses of reinnervated skin to sustained and repeated indentations were found to be similar to those of normal skin, and therefore, could not account for the abnormal discharge behavior. It is suggested that the transitional properties of regenerating afferents reflect unstable axon-end organ connections and immature axonal properties. Both factors would contribute to the slow course of sensory recovery, making prognosis on tactile recovery unpredictable.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "[CT-guided stereotactic neurosurgery].", "issue": "4", "pmid": "539458", "authors": ["Takizawa, T", "Sato, S", "Matsumoto, A", "Sano, A", "Takahashi, K", "Murakami, Y", "Ohta, K"], "year": "1985", "journal": "No shinkei geka.

Pure tonal stimuli were delivered through sealed and calibrated earphones and were presented either monaurally or binaurally with interaural intensity differences (IIDs) and interaural time differences (ITDs). Acoustically sensitive cells were found in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC throughout its rostrocaudal and mediolateral extent. Most cells (80%) discharged only at stimulus onset; the rest had more complex firing patterns. For 88% of our sample the mean first-spike latency measured at 20 dB above threshold ranged between 6 and 16 ms. The sharpness and threshold intensity of the frequency tuning curves varied widely. In the SC, the average characteristic frequency and threshold intensity were higher than in other auditory brain stem nuclei. Neurons whose characteristic frequency was low were never sharply tuned. The probability of response decreased when the repetition rate at which the stimuli were delivered increased. The mean stimulus interval at which spike count reached 50% of maximum was 360 ms. Most (83%) of the cells discharged only to monaural stimulation of the contralateral ear, 7% responded to tones applied to either ear and only 1% to only ipsilateral input. The remaining cells responded only to stimulation of both ears. With binaural stimuli, most neurons (80%) could be shown to receive input from both ears. Seventy percent of the binaural cells showed predominant binaural inhibition (BI), 25% binaural facilitation (BF), and 5% a more complex mixture. Because the majority of SC neurons had high characteristic frequencies, we examined their responses to IIDs. The spike count vs. IID functions of BI cells were monotonic and sigmoidal, those of BF cells were nonmonotonic and bell-shaped. The slopes and horizontal positions of the curves varied among neurons. IIDs favoring the contralateral ear were the most effective. For a given cell, increasing the mean binaural level extended the range of IIDs that evoked maximal discharge.

The lateral suprasylvian area seems to be an important source of visual input to the deep collicular strata but it is unclear whether Y-cell influences reach this extrastriate area and, hence, whether this area participates in the indirect Y-cell pathway. In this study, retinal influences on the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS) were studied in anesthetized cats. Responses to electrical stimulation of the optic disk (OD) and optic chiasm (OX) were recorded in single units in PMLS and in neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) that were antidromically driven from PMLS. Virtually all PMLS cells (99%; 99/100) exhibited small differences (less than or equal to 0.8 ms) between OD- and OX-activation latency, indicating that they were driven by a pathway originating in rapidly conducting Y-cell axons. A small number of PMLS cells (17%; 20/118) had very short activation latencies (less than or equal to 3.2 ms from OX), comparable to those of cells in areas 17 and 18 receiving monosynaptic inputs from geniculate Y-cells. Further, LGNd cells with latency behaviors typical of Y-cells could be antidromically driven from PMLS, confirming that geniculate Y-cells project directly to PMLS. Most PMLS cells (83%; 98/118), though exhibiting small OD-OX latency differences, had absolute latencies too long to be attributed to direct inputs from geniculate Y-cells (3.3-8.5 ms from OX). Thus Y-cells in the LGNd influence most PMLS cells by way of a multisynaptic pathway. PMLS cells antidromically activated from the superior colliculus were driven only by this multisynaptic Y-cell input. Total conduction time from the retina through PMLS to the colliculus corresponds closely to the latency of the indirect Y-cell activation observed in the deep collicular layers. These results support the view that the lateral suprasylvian cortex constitutes an important source of visual input to the cat's deep collicular layers and, more generally, that the extrastriate visual cortex may figure prominently in the cortical control of gaze.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "53", "title": "Responses of neurons in the cat's superior colliculus to acoustic stimuli.

Wide ranges of antidromic latencies were observed overall, with frontal and parietal stimulation yielding values ranging from 1.0 to 26.0 ms and 1.6-24.0 ms, respectively. Individual neurons often exhibited multiple antidromic latencies, such that deeper sites of stimulation or greater stimulation amplitudes generally yielded discretely different, shorter latencies than more superficial sites or lower amplitudes of stimulation. Single neurons were also often driven from neighboring sites (1-2 mm apart) within the frontal cortex, but no cell was coactivated from both frontal and parietal cortices. Finally, patterns and rates of spontaneous activity varied markedly among these cortically projecting neurons, with some cells being non-spontaneous and others exhibiting tonic rates of 30-40 Hz. Impulse waveforms also differed among driven cells, from relatively low-amplitude, negative spikes to large-amplitude, entirely positive spikes in unfiltered signals. These results indicate that cortically projecting, putatively cholinergic neurons in the basal fore-brain form a physiologically heterogeneous population in terms of impulse conduction velocity, spontaneous discharge, and spike waveforms. Our finding of multiple antidromic latencies and driving from neighboring sites indicate that these fibers may be highly branched in local terminal fields, but that individual cells may project exclusively to a single cortical area. Faster conduction velocities for deep compared to superficial cortical stimulation sites imply that these fibers may become non-myelinated upon entering cortical terminal fields, or that they may become markedly thinner as they travel within the cortex. This system of cholinergic cortical afferents differs in many physiologic aspects from the other non-thalamic cortical input systems of catecholamine or indoleamine neurons.", "pages": "43-52"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "[Computerized tomography-guided stereotaxic implantation of deep brain-stimulating electrodes].", "issue": "3", "pmid": "6809936", "authors": ["Takizawa, T"], "year": "1985", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "abstract": "The right mystacial vibrissae of awake, adult rats were stroked at 4-6 times/second and brain regions which increased (14C) 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake were mapped autoradiographically. The ventral parts of the ipsilateral spinal trigeminal nuclei pars caudalis (Sp5c), pars interpolaris (Sp5i), pars oralis (Sp5o), and the principal trigeminal sensory (Pr5) nuclei were activated. The lateral part of the ipsilateral facial (VII) nucleus (the region which innervates the vibrissae muscles) was also activated possibly via excitatory, trigeminal (Sp5c, Sp5i, Sp5o, Pr5) sensory afferents. A number of regions were activated contralateral to the sensory stimulus. Discrete patches of (14C) 2DG uptake occurred in deep layers of the superior colliculus (SCsgp). Dorsolateral and dorsomedial parts of the ventrobasal nucleus (VB), and posterior, dorsolateral parts of the reticular nucleus (R) of thalamus were activated, along with broad portions of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and second somatosensory cortex (SII). Though all layers of SI and SII cortex increased 2DG uptake, VB thalamic afferents to layers IV and Vc-Vla presumably accounted for the greater activation of these cortical layers during repetitive sensory stimulation of the vibrissae (RSSV). Activation of the above structures fits well with known anatomical data. However, the pattern of activation during RSSV was very different from that previously described during vibrissae motor cortex stimulation (VMIS). RSSV and VMIS both produced similar repetitive movements of all the mystacial vibrissae. However, only a few overlapping brain regions were activated during both RSSV and VMIS. These RSSV-VMIS overlap zones included Sp5o; rostral Sp5i; lateral VII; SCsgp; ventrobasal-posteromedial and ventrobasal-ventrolateral zones in thalamus; and a rostral region of SI probably anterior to the Woolsey vibrissae barrelfield in the dysgranular somatosensory (SI) cortex. Since RSSV and VMIS would both be expected to activate vibrissae proprioceptors, we have hypothesized that vibrissae proprioceptive input was processed in part in the RSSV-VMIS overlap zones.

In 4 of these animals, 46 single and 134 multiple neuronal responses were studied after transection of the dorsal columns contralateral to the cortical recording sites. Receptive field positions overlapped considerably in SII during orthogonal electrode penetrations, but were shifted during tangential penetrations. Analysis of the receptive field positions for neurons encountered in tangential penetrations indicated that receptive fields rarely overlapped when the neurons were separated by more than 750 microns. Using a variety of hand-held stimuli, neuronal responses were assessed according to several criteria including: velocity, adaptation, following rate, spontaneous activity, and whether the response was elicited by stimulating hairs, skin, claws, or deep tissue. Based on these parameters, it was possible to discern several types of neuronal responses in SII. Among these, over 60% of the neurons in our sample responded best to movement of hairs. A smaller number of neurons responded as though they received inputs from Pacinian receptors or rapidly adapting receptors in the glabrous skin. In about 20% of the single neuron sample, it was not possible to identify a selective adequate stimulus, however, these cells responded to somatic stimuli, such as taps. Approximately 5% of the neurons could not be driven with somatic sensory stimuli. Following dorsal column lesions, some neurons in SII still responded to cutaneous stimulation, primarily hair movement. Most SII neurons were more difficult to drive, the responses were more sluggish and receptive fields were less well-defined. A greater proportion of single neuron responses (greater than 60%) could not be activated by any type of somatic sensory stimulus.
