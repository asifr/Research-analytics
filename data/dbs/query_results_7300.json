The pupillary response elicited by a step and sinusoidally modulated light stimulus was used. In acute cerebellectomized cats, the high frequency cutoff of the frequency response of the pupillary reflex was moved to a lower level after cerebellar lesions. Selective lesions were made in the deep cerebellar nuclei and the frequency responses of the pupillary reflex were compared. The fastigial lesions produced the most prominent change in the frequency responses. Electrical stimulation of the deep cerebellar nuclei, especially the fastigial nuclei, induced pupillary dilatation. Thus the cerebellum appears to participate in the control of the pupillary light reflex by improving the frequency responses of the pupil so that it can follow changing light stimuli better, and this control is exerted via the bilateral fastigial nuclei.", "pages": "69-79"}, {"volume": "55", "title": "Inhibition of cerebral cortical neurones by a 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathway from median raph\u00e9 nucleus.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "884623", "authors": ["Sastry, BS", "Phillis, JW"], "year": "1977", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "abstract": "Recent observations made in our laboratory have shown that metergoline is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonist in the cerebral cortex.

This fact was confirmed by considering the wide distribution in the dorsal horn of cells receiving A and C input. However, spinal organization of the different classes of cells consists of a preferential distribution rather than a strict lamination.

The majority of the cells (67%) were only responsive to ipsilateral stimulation. However, many (28%) responded to stimulation of either canine pulp and a few (5%) responsed to contralateral stimulation alone. The neurons were localized histologically in the necleus proprius of the rostral trigeminal nucleus caudalis (NVCaud) and in dorsal portions of the ventromedially contiguous lateral reticular formation (LRF). Cells exclusively responsive to ipsilateral stimuli had a relatively wide dorsoventral distribution. In contrast, 'bilateral' and 'contralateral' cells were situated only in the deep NVCaud-LRF border zone or in immediately adjacent portions of the LRF. Generally, ipsilateral stimuli evoked response bursts with shorter latencies, more spike potentials and briefer interspike intervals than equivalent contralateral stimuli. In experiments designed to study afferent interactions, a conditioning stimulus, applied to either the ipsilateral or the contralateral canine, preceded a test stimulus applied to the other canine at predetermined interstimulus intervals. Responses to the test stimulus were either totally or partially suppressed when intervals of moderate duration (90-500 msec) were used. However, responses to the test stimulus frequently were enhanced when the intervals were breif (less than or equal to 60 msec) or when the teeth were stimulated simultaneously. The results reveal that bilateral afferents from the pulps of the canine teeth converge upon neurons of bulbar trigeminal structures, that the neurons are differentially responsive to the activation of ipsilateral and contralateral pulpal receptors and that bilateral afferent barrages originating in the canine pulps interact to modulate the firing patterns of the neurons.", "pages": "69-79"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Field potentials in the olfactory bulb of the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri): evidence for a dendrodendritic inhibitory pathway.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "776815", "authors": ["MacLeod, NK", "Lowe, GA"], "year": "1976", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

REM AERs resembled, in amplitude and peak latency, those recorded in the LG and pulvinar during wakefulness; in the visual cortex and retrocalcarine sulcus, they were similar to those obtained during wakefulness and stage 1. In conclusion, a different evoked response was found between visual cortex and deep structures (except for the OT): firstly, during slow-wave sleep (the AERs showed a difference for stage 1 between the visual cortex or the retrocalcarine sulcus and the LG or the pulvinar), secondly, in REM (on the cortex, REM AERs looked like wakefulness and stage 1 responses); on the contrary, in the LG and pulvinar, REM AERs were similar only to those recorded during waking.

Separate zones may activate different muscles. Forelimb muscles were primarily activated from areas in the dorsomedial quadrants of the red nucleus whereas hindlimb muscles were predominantly activated from the ventorlateral quadrants. With stimulus currents of 10 muA there was considerable overlap in the effective zones activating different muscles. In the majority of cases the minimal threshold was under 10 muA when stimilating with a 50-msec pulse train. Current thresholds for electromypgraphic changes in the muscles varied inversely with pulse frequency and train duration. When long stimulus trains were applied to the red nucleus, the resulting muscle contraction was sustained for the duration of the stimulus. These motor effects did not depend upon the motor cortex or pyramidal tract but were mediated by a tract in contralateral dorsal quadrants of the spinal cord which was likely to be the rubrospinal tract. Units within the red nucleus typically had wide cutaneous receptive fields and responded to deep pressure and joint rotation in one or more limbs. Usually the focus driving the cell most briskly was located in one of the contralateral limbs and corresponded to the limb where muscle contraction was elicited by microstimulation with the same electrode. It is concluded that the red nucleus includes overlapping efferent neuronal colonies controlling individual muscles irrespective of their functional class. This property is shared by the motor cortex and suggests that these two structures may complement each other in the control of movement.

(2) The stimulus parameters for producing low threshold contraction of limb muscles were different from those for face muscles. The decrease of the frequency gradualy increased the threshold values for face muscles whereas the decrease abruptly increased the threshold for limb muscles. The optimum duration of the train for the lowest thresholds was longer for face muscles. (3) Stimulation of cerebellar nuclei (interpositus and lateralis) produced contraction of limb muscles. The stimulus parameters for the minimum threshold were similar to those for producing contraction of limb muscles from the ventral thalamus.

The discharges of all significant motor units of the muscle were monitored by electromyography, and contractions of the various motor units were observed in isometric recordings of muscle tension. Over a wide range, muscle tension could be enhanced by an increased intensity of pad pinching or cortical stimulation. This increase in muscle tension was caused by a recruitment of new motor units as well as by an increase in the firing rate of already active motor units. The latter mechanism was clearly of great importance. Pad pinching or cortical stimulation could sometimes cause the muscle to produce a tension close to that of a maximum tetanic contraction. This was several times greater than the mean tension that would have been caused by motor unit recruitment alone (i.e. by the motor units firing at their minimum steady rate).

Waves I and II were negative at bulbar surfaces receiving olfactory input and positive deep within the bulb. This series of potentials could be evoked by 3 methods of odor stimulation: (1) large puffs delivered from odorant test bottles, (2) small puffs delivered from a syringe and (3) continuous flow with concentration and nasal flow rate parameters controlled by an olfactometer. When the odor evoked response was recorded at a bulbar locus, these potentials were seen in response to each stimulation and the amplitudes of each wave were reproducible with the same stimulus. The amplitudes of the 3 waves were compared in the gopher tortoise and differed with the 3 odorants tested--high purity geraniol, technical grade geraniol and amyl acetate. Odorant concentration also directly affected the response amplitudes of all 3 wave components.

Single units were classified as pyramidal tract neurones or non-pyramidal tract neurones according to their antidromic responsiveness to stimuli applied in the dorsolateral funiculus at C1-2.3. Responses to electrical stimulation of the deep (motor) radial nerve, the deep palmar (motor) branch of the ulnar nerve, and the superficial (cutaneous) radial nerve could be recorded in the majority of neurones of the motor cortex provided that short trains of strong stimuli were used. Minimal responses to muscle nerve stimulation were observed in a few neurones at 1.4 x group I threshold, but most units reacted only with higher stimulus intensities (2-3 x group I threshold).4. The latencies to peripheral nerve stimulation were measured from the first peak of the incoming volley recorded at the root entry zone. The mean response latencies of pyramidal tract cells were between 20 and 25 msec; non-pyramidal tract cells were activated at slightly shorter mean latencies, the difference being significant for superficial radial nerve stimulation only (4 msec). These latencies are more than twice as long as those recorded in the postcentral gyrus, and the probability of discharge is lower than for postcentral neurones.5. A further difference between neurones of the postcentral and precentral gyrus is the pronounced convergence from different nerves and also from different modalities (cutaneous and muscle afferents) in units of the precentral cortex in contrast to units of the postcentral cortex.6. The high thresholds, necessary to activate precentral neurones by muscle nerve stimulation, make it unlikely that group I muscle afferents are involved. This is, furthermore, indicated by the lack of responsiveness to intravenous injection of succinylcholine which was, however, effective for driving neurones of the specific projection area for group I afferents, area 3a. The present experiments are consistent with the view that sensitivity of precentral neurones to muscle stretch (described in previous studies) is due to activation of secondary muscle spindle endings and their ascending pathways.7. The original hypothesis of a load compensating ;pyramidal reflex' with an oligosynaptic afferent contribution from the spindle primaries can be discarded.

Acetylcholine (0.5 mg/ml) produced weak transient respiratory stimulation and a small fluctuation in blood pressure which disappeared in repeated tests. Methacholine (1 mg/ml) caused a brief hyperpnea and a fall in blood pressure both of which were abolished after atropine (0.2 mg) was injected into the third ventricle. Pilocarpine (10 mg/ml) elicited no change in respiration or blood pressure. Respiratory and cardiovascular effects produced by strychnine (1 mg/ml) were attributable non-specifically to convulsive movements of the animal. Ethamivan (1 mg/ml) produced a single deep breath and a slowly reversing rise in blood pressure. Cyanide (0.5 mg/ml) barely stimulated the respiration but it produced a long lasting rise in blood pressure. Ethyl alcohol (0.1 ml/ml) elicited brisk though brief respiratory stimulation and a short lasting fall in blood pressure.4. It was shown that the effects of procaine and nicotine were not qualitatively altered when the perfusion effluent was collected through a ventral craniotomy instead of the cisterna magna.", "pages": "69-79"}, {"volume": "33", "title": "Chronic pretrigeminal and cerveau isol\u00e9 cats.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1175061", "authors": ["Sl\u00f3sarska, M", "Zernicki, B"], "year": "1973", "journal": "Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis", "abstract": "1. In anaesthetized cats, in which the carotid arterial bifurcation had been denervated and the spinal cord transected at the cervical level, reversible bradycardia mediated by the vagus nerves was elicited by temporary arrest of the cranial circulation. Methoxamine was infused intravenously to maintain peripheral vascular resistance, and artificial ventilation was given to avert systemic asphyxia.2. The bradycardia persisted in cats subjected to one or more of the following acute surgical procedures: left vagotomy, mid-collicular decerebration, decerebellation, bulbar transections at the acoustic striae and inferior fovea, and destruction of the area postrema and the underlying dorsal vagal nuclei. Ischaemia-induced bradycardia was invariably abolished after bilateral vagotomy or the administration of atropine.3. Bradycardia could not be elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsal vagal nuclei, but was evoked by stimulation of deep structures in the vicinity of the nucleus ambiguus even after destruction of the dorsal vagal nuclei.4. Simultaneous application of ischaemia and electrical stimulation of the medullary cardio-decelerator locus produced convergent occlusion of the vagal response. The effect of ischaemia was inhibited by stimulation of a neighbouring region in the medial reticular formation. These interactions indicate that an interneuronal link is involved in the mechanism of ischaemia-induced bradycardia.5. It is concluded that the cardio-decelerator response to ischaemia is initiated upstream to the primary efferent vagal motor neurones and that the cardio-inhibitory fibres do not originate in the dorsal vagal nuclei.", "pages": "69-79"}, {"volume": "228", "title": "Input from muscle and cutaneous nerves of the hand and forearm to neurones of the precentral gyrus of baboons and monkeys.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "1175060", "authors": ["Wiesendanger, M"], "year": "1973", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "abstract": "1.

Muscle afferent projections from the contralateral hind limb to the postsigmoid gyrus of the cerebral cortex were investigated in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. The evoked potentials were recorded from the cortical surface or from deeper layers by penetrating micro-electrodes. Graded electrical stimulation of the nerves was used.2. Group Ia as well as Ib muscle afferents from the contralateral quadriceps, posterior biceps-semitendinosus, gastrocnemius-soleus and deep peroneal muscles projected to two different loci in the postsigmoid gyrus. One of these was located on the dorsal surface of the hemisphere 4-5 mm lateral to the mid line and 1-3 mm posterior to the cruciate sulcus, thus rostro-medial to the postcruciate dimple. The other was located on the medial surface of the hemisphere adjacent to the cruciate sulcus. There was no overlap between the two loci.3. There was no significant difference in thresholds or latencies of the Group I responses in the two loci. The latency was short and similar to that of the potential evoked by the cutaneous afferents in the somatosensory primary projection areas.4. The Group Ib path was largely independent of the Ia path, because a maximal Group I volley evoked a response, when the Ia path was made refractory by simultaneous stimulation with a maximal Ia volley at 20 per second.5. The cortical potentials evoked by the Group I muscle afferents from the contralateral hind limb did not change after transection of the dorsal columns at C1-C3 levels but disappeared after a superficial section in the dorsolateral fascicle at C1 level. The responses were not affected by cerebellectomy. It was concluded that the path travelled with the dorsal spinocerebellar tract or utilized brain stem collaterals of this tract.6. Group II muscle afferents evoked a response near the border of the Group I loci, but not in the positions where the Group I responses were maximal in amplitude.7. The receptor origin of the stimulated Group I afferents, the location of the medullary relay in the Group I path and the destination of the efferent outflow from the Group I loci were discussed.", "pages": "69-79"}, {"volume": "44", "title": "Respiratory responses to chemical pulses in the cerebrospinal fluid of cats.", "issue": "4", "pmid": "1175040", "authors": ["Borison, HL", "Haranath, PS", "McCarthy, LE"], "year": "1972", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "abstract": "1. The spino-olivocerebellar path ascending through the ventral funiculus (VF-SOCP) was investigated in decerebrate cats with the cord transected in the third cervical segment except for the left ventral funiculus. The climbing fibre responses evoked in Purkinje cells were studied by recording from single cells and by recording the mass activity at the cerebellar surface or in the molecular layer.2. In the spinal cord the forelimb component of the VF-SOCP occupies a medial part and the hind limb component a lateral part of the ventral funiculus.3. The main projection of the limb nerves through the VF-SOCP is to the lateral two thirds of the vermis of the anterior lobe. The projection area consists of three sagittally arranged bands: a lateral band receiving olivary axons activated exclusively from the ipsilateral hind limb, an intermediate band receiving olivary axons activated bilaterally from the hind limbs, and a medial band receiving olivary axons activated bilaterally from the forelimbs. Some olivary neurones are activated from all four limbs.4. The latency of the climbing fibre responses was about 22 msec on stimulation of ipsilateral hind limb nerves and about 20 msec on stimulation of ipsilateral forelimb nerves. The responses evoked from contralateral nerves had a latency which was about 3 msec longer than the latency of the corresponding ipsilateral responses.5. The olivary neurones were usually activated from all tested muscle and skin nerves in the limb(s) constituting the receptive field. Cutaneous afferents and groups II and III muscle afferents were responsible for the excitation elicited by single shock stimulation of the nerves. Brief repetitive stimulation revealed additional activation from mainly Ib, but also Ia, afferents in ipsilateral hind limb nerves.6.

The effects of I.V. injection of tubocurarine (3 mg/kg) and of acute hypotension upon electrocortical activity of cats under sodium pentobarbitone were analysed. Technical artifacts associated with changes in brain volume were minimized.2. Initially, the superficial cortical response was reduced by tubocurarine either insignificantly or by 34% or less. Cats bled before injection of tubocurarine showed initially a similar reduction but, occasionally, a severe delayed reduction was found. Any fall in the superficial cortical response started during the secondary rise in B.P., many seconds after the B.P. had reached its lowest initial level. By contrast, spontaneous electrocortical activity was reduced approximately when the peak initial fall of B.P. occurred and it started to recover during the secondary rise in B.P. Reduction of the superficial cortical response could still be elicited after spindling had been suppressed by deep barbiturate anaesthesia. The initial thalamocortical afferent component in somatosensory area I, which was evoked by dorsal column stimulation, was less reduced by injection of tubocurarine than were the post-synaptic positive-negative components.3. The depressant effects of injected tubocurarine upon the superficial cortical response and spindle activity were approximated by rapid arterial bleeding.4. The superficial cortical response was reduced following virtual arrest of the cerebral circulation by acute exsanguination or by acute oil embolization. Such reduction most likely does not depend on systemic transport of inhibitory substances to the brain.5. After injection of tubocurarine the rate of outflow from the superior sagittal sinus was variably reduced during the initial fall in B.P., and often showed a variable, secondary increase. A net deficit in cerebral blood flow was usually present during the period of 80 sec after injection.6. The variability in the effects of injected tubocurarine upon electrocortical activity is attributed to the variability of the net deficit in cerebral blood flow.", "pages": "69-79"}, {"volume": "154", "title": "Pleasure and brain activity in man.
