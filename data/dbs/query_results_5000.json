Eight sides in seven patients out of 15 sides in 12 patients were identified that had peaks in the gamma band in spectra of LFPs.

Recent advances in functional brain imaging have identified critical neural circuits involving the amygdala and other limbic structures, prefrontal cortical regions, thalamus, and basal ganglia that modulate emotional behavior and are disturbed in primary and secondary mood disorders. Growing evidence suggests that mechanisms of neural plasticity and cellular resilience, including impairments of neurotrophic signaling cascades as well as altered glutamatergic and glucocorticoid signaling, underlie the dysregulation in these circuits. The increasing ability to monitor and modulate activity in these circuits is beginning to yield greater insight into the neurobiological basis of mood disorders.

The objective is to keep the patient at Hoehn and Yahr Stage 2.0 or lower level of disability (bilateral findings with preserved postural reflexes) during off-stage and to avoid adverse effects. There is no long-term difference between standard preparations and control release formulations of LD/carbidopa or LD/benserazide. In older subjects, the first choice is LD. In patients who cannot be managed medically, surgical treatment is an option in selected patients (nondemented, <70 years old, previous good LD response). The surgical treatment of choice is currently subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation.

It is a common disorder seen in a quarter of consecutively admitted depressed patients and is often associated with severe symptomatology, increased suicide risk, poor acute response to antidepressants and poor acute and long-term treatment outcome. It is possible that poor response in psychotic depression is caused by the fact that we have yet to identify the most efficacious treatment protocol for psychotic MDD. Multiple studies have shown that modifications in the treatment paradigm may increase treatment efficacy in psychotic MDD. It has been generally accepted that, during the acute treatment phase, antidepressant-antipsychotic drug combination therapy is more effective than either treatment alone, although this strategy has recently been challenged. The question of the optimal duration of pharmacotherapy in order to prevent relapse and improve long-term (i.e., 5-year) outcome is a focus of current investigation. This article will review currently recommended treatment strategies for the acute, continuation and maintenance phases of therapy. In particular, it will address the role of newer-generation antidepressants, the role of second-generation antipsychotics, the use of mood stabilizers and indications for electroconvulsive therapy.

The latency observed is better explained by molecular alterations than immediate electrophysiological processes, and clinical improvement may involve adaptive gene expression. Here, we have studied immediate early gene expression as fast molecular response to subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Bipolar electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the subthalamic nucleus of anesthetized male Wistar rats. High-frequency stimulation (130 Hz or 80 Hz, 60 micros, 300 microA) or low-frequency stimulation (5 Hz, 60 micros, 300 microA) was performed with the right electrode for 15, 60, 120, and 240 min whereas the silent left electrode served as negative control. Brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion and frozen sections were stained with polyclonal antibodies directed against three immediate early gene-encoded proteins, c-Fos, c-Jun, and Krox-24 (NGFI-A, Egr-1, Zif268, Tis8, Zenk). After 120 and 240 h, c-Fos immunoreactivity was strongly upregulated in subthalamic nucleus neurons on the stimulated site. In contrast, no c-Fos immunoreactivity was detected on the non-stimulated site except for single positive cells located in close proximity to the electrode tracks. Furthermore, c-Fos immunoreactivity was induced in subthalamic nucleus projection areas, such as primary and secondary motor cortex, primary somatosensory and insular cortex, lateral and medial globus pallidus, suprageniculate thalamic nucleus, pontine nuclei, medial geniculate nucleus, and substantia nigra. Similarly, c-Jun and Krox-24 were induced at the site of stimulation and in projection areas following high-frequency subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Whereas high frequency stimulation with 80 Hz was similarly effective none of the three immediate early gene-encoded proteins was induced with low-frequency stimulation (5 Hz) for 4 h. This is in accordance with the therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation which are only elicited with high frequency stimulation. Our data provide evidence that immediate early gene expression in the subthalamic nucleus is rapidly and substantially induced by high-frequency stimulation.

It is commonly assumed that superficial and deep EC neurons project to and receive from the hippocampal formation, respectively. Anatomical evidences suggest that both the hippocampal output and deep EC neurons also project to superficial EC layers. To functionally characterize the interlaminar synaptic EC circuit entrained the by hippocampal output, we performed simultaneous intracellular recordings and laminar profile analysis in the medial EC (m-EC) of the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain after polysynaptic hippocampal activation by lateral olfactory tract (LOT) stimulation. Optical imaging of voltage-generated signals confirmed that the LOT-evoked hippocampus-mediated response is restricted to the m-EC. The hippocampal output generated an extracellular current sink in layers V-VI, coupled with an EPSP in deep neurons. Deep neuron firing was terminated by a biphasic IPSP. The earliest response observed in superficial layer neurons was characterized by a feedforward IPSP of circa 100 ms (-69 +/- 1.3 mV reversal potential) abolished by local application of 1 mm bicuculline.

Microelectrode recordings in the human thalamus have revealed tremor cells that fire synchronous with electromyographic tremor. The efficacy of DBS likely depends on its ability to modify the activity of these tremor cells either synaptically by stopping afferent tremor signals or by directly altering the intrinsic membrane currents of the neurons. To test these possibilities, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of ventral thalamic neurons were obtained from rat brain slices. DBS was simulated (sDBS) using extracellular constant current pulse trains (125 Hz, 60-80 micros, 0.25-5 mA, 1-30 s) applied through a bipolar electrode. Using a paired-pulse protocol, we first established that thalamocortical relay neurons receive converging input from multiple independent afferent fibers. Second, although sDBS induced homosynaptic depression of EPSPs along its own pathway, it did not alter the response from a second independent pathway. Third, in contrast to the subthalamic nucleus, sDBS in the thalamus failed to inhibit the rebound potential and the persistent Na+ current but did activate the Ih current. Finally, in eight patients undergoing thalamic DBS surgery for essential tremor, microstimulation was most effective in alleviating tremor when applied in close proximity to recorded tremor cells. However, stimulation could still suppress tremor at distances incapable of directly spreading to recorded tremor cells. These complementary data indicate that DBS may induce a \"functional deafferentation\" of afferent axons to thalamic tremor cells, thereby preventing tremor signal propagation in humans.", "pages": "566-71"}, {"volume": "68 Suppl 1", "title": "Epilepsy, surgery, and the elderly.", "issue": "", "pmid": "9878693", "authors": ["Gallo, BV"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Epilepsy research", "abstract": "Dyskinesias are a transient but severe complication of subthalamotomy in some patients.", "pages": "566-71"}, {"volume": "117", "title": "Sources and effects of electrode impedance during deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10068386", "authors": ["Butson, CR", "Maks, CB", "McIntyre, CC"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "Three patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing bilateral micro-recording guided surgery of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are described; deep brain stimulation (DBS) was used in one case, and subthalamotomy in the other two.

Whereas anatomical studies quantify extensive convergence/divergence patterns in the circuit, suggesting an information sharing scheme, neurophysiological studies report an absence of linear correlation between single neurones in normal animals, suggesting a segregated parallel processing scheme. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys and in parkinsonian patients single neurones become linearly correlated, thus leading to a loss of segregation between neurones. Here we propose a possible integrative solution to this debate, by extending the concept of functional segregation from the cellular level to the network level. To this end, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of parkinsonian patients. By applying bispectral analysis, we found that in the absence of dopamine stimulation STN LFP rhythms became non-linearly correlated, thus leading to a loss of segregation between rhythms. Non-linear correlation was particularly consistent between the low-beta rhythm (13-20 Hz) and the high-beta rhythm (20-35 Hz). Levodopa administration significantly decreased these non-linear correlations, therefore increasing segregation between rhythms. These results suggest that the extensive convergence/divergence in the basal ganglia circuit is physiologically necessary to sustain LFP rhythms distributed in large ensembles of neurones, but is not sufficient to induce correlated firing between neurone pairs. Conversely, loss of dopamine generates pathological linear correlation between neurone pairs, alters the patterns within LFP rhythms, and induces non-linear correlation between LFP rhythms operating at different frequencies. The pathophysiology of information processing in the human basal ganglia therefore involves not only activities of individual rhythms, but also interactions between rhythms.", "pages": "566-71"}, {"volume": "15", "title": "Deep brain stimulation therapy for the vegetative state.", "issue": "3-4", "pmid": "12856488", "authors": ["Yamamoto, T", "Katayama, Y"], "year": "", "journal": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation", "abstract": "Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear.

In 5 dystonic patients with mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in the contralateral muscles were coherent with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs at the burst frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG and LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 cases, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhythmic EMG bursts. In comparison with the resting condition, in both active and passive movements, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The finding of significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activity may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movements. In contrast, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be represented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum.

Accordingly, we recorded LFPs from the four contacts of DBS electrodes as the latter were advanced in 2 mm steps from a point 4-6 mm above the intended surgical target point in the STN, to a point 4 mm below this. Contacts were configured to give three bipolar recordings of LFPs. These were analyzed on 16 sides in 9 patients. The power in the 13-35 Hz band recorded at the lowest contact pair underwent a steep but focal increase during electrode descent.

However, since there exists no definitive test for psychogenic dystonia, researchers must determine fair and just criteria for excluding patients whose dystonia is suspected to be primarily psychogenic.", "pages": "566-71"}, {"volume": "170", "title": "Evolution of postural stability after subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson's disease: a combined clinical and posturometric study.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "10570754", "authors": ["Guehl, D", "Dehail, P", "de S\u00e8ze, MP", "Cuny, E", "Faux, P", "Tison, F", "Barat, M", "Bioulac, B", "Burbaud, P"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Experimental brain research.

Materials and Methods.\u2002 We studied a total of 39 patients - 29 with STN and 10 with GPi DBS over a period of up to 6\u00a0years. Mean ages in the two groups were similar (59 and 60\u00a0years, respectively) and disease duration prior to implantation was similar (9.6 and 11.7\u00a0years, respectively). Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was recorded preoperatively and at follow-up (at least at 6-month intervals). Medications also were recorded, and each patient's levodopa equivalent units (LEU) were calculated. Results were analyzed using a paired Student's t-test. Results.\u2002 LEU reduced significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the STN group (5.7 to 3.7) but not the GPi group. Both targets significantly improved part 3 and part 4 scores of the UPDRS but GPi DBS did not improve part 2 scores (activities of daily living). STN DBS had much better outcome on the motor \"off\" scores of the UPDRS, whereas GPi only improved tremor. A comparison of the \"earliest 10\" and \"most recent 10\" STN patients showed a significant improvement in outcome in the most recent cases. Conclusions.\u2002 In our group, STN was more effective for alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson disease, even in older patients with significant dyskinesias. Better patient selection and greater experience have led to more improvement in the more recent patients.", "pages": "566-71"}, {"volume": "36", "title": "Transcranial stimulation normalizes blood sugar levels in alloxan diabetes in rats.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "10622338", "authors": ["Lebedev, VP", "Bilichenko, SV", "Malygin, AV", "Nechiporenko, SP", "Kolbasov, SE", "Melikhova, MV"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Neuroscience and behavioral physiology", "abstract": "Camptocormia is a well-known feature in cases of Parkinson disease (PD), and is usually unresponsive to dopaminergic therapy.
