The results of studies involving sine-wave and rectangular pulse electrical stimulation and chemical (NMDA) stimulation are summarized. Stimulation of SC and PAG produced freezing and flight behaviors along with exophthalmus (fully opened bulged eyes), micturition and defecation. The columnar organization of the PAG was evident in the results obtained. Defecation was elicited primarily by lateral PAG stimulation, while the remaining defensive behaviors were similarly elicited by lateral and dorsolateral PAG stimulation, although with the lowest thresholds in the dorsolateral column. Conversely, the ventrolateral PAG did not appear to participate in unconditioned defensive behaviors, which were only elicited by high intensity stimulation likely to encroach on adjacent regions. In the SC, the most important differences relative to the PAG were the lack of stimulation-evoked jumping in both intermediate and deep layers, and of NMDA-evoked galloping in intermediate layers. Therefore, we conclude that the SC may be only involved in the increased attentiveness (exophthalmus, immobility) and restlessness (trotting) of prey species exposed to the cues of a nearby predator. These responses may be distinct from the full-blown flight reaction that is mediated by the dorsolateral and lateral PAG. However, other evidences suggest the possible influences of stimulation schedule, environment dimensions and rat strain in determining outcomes.

A strong positive correlation of rCBF to increasing stimulation frequency was detected around the STN bilaterally. More importantly, we show that gradual increases in STN stimulation frequency are tightly correlated with decreases in motor cortex activity. This demonstrates an active modulation of resting activity within the subcortical stimulation target and within motor cortex by STN DBS.

Thresholds were unaffected by the visual conditions, such as light versus darkness, or movement of the eyes; but in one animal blind after acute glaucoma thresholds for loci in striate cortex were permanently decreased by about 50%. Learning to respond to electrical stimulation of the optic tract produced no tendency to respond to such stimulation of striate cortex. Onset of stimulation at a given locus could be detected even in the face of continuous supraliminal stimulation at four surrounding loci on a 3-mm radius. The surround stimulation did alter the threshold of the central locus, but such stimuli could not summate if they were subliminal by some 10%. Cessation of stimulation that had been continuing for 1 min to 1 h could be detected if it were being applied at a level 20-75% above that needed for detection of stimulus onset. Continuous stimulation had a pronounced \"priming\" effect, in that modulation of frequency or intensity of such stimulation by as little as 5% could be detected (e.g., 20 microA in a background of 500 microA, or <2-ms interpulse interval with pulses at 50 Hz). Using pulses inserted in various phase relations to ongoing pulses at 2-5 Hz, it could be determined that stimulus pulses were surrounded by a strong facilitatory period for about 30 ms, which was then replaced by refractoriness.

Robust responses of DCN neurons to somatosensory stimuli have been described, but a detailed examination of their somatotopic arrangement and stimulus coding properties is lacking. To address these questions, we recorded extracellular, single-unit activity in the DCN of ketamine-anesthetized rats in response to air-puff stimuli aimed at six different orofacial and forelimb locations. In additional experiments, the duration and intensity of air-puff stimuli to the ipsilateral upper lip were systematically varied. Overall, we found that DCN neuron responses to air puff stimuli showed combinations of three distinct response components: a short-latency spike response, a pronounced inhibition, and a long-latency increase in firing. Individual neurons responsive to air-puff stimulation exhibited any combination of just one, two, or all three of these response components. The inhibitory response was most common and frequently consisted of a complete cessation of spiking despite a high spontaneous rate of baseline firing. In contrast to published findings from cerebellar cortical recordings, the receptive fields of all responsive neurons in the DCN were large. In fact, the receptive field of most neurons covered the ipsi- and contralateral face as well as forepaws. Response properties of individual neurons did not reliably indicate stimulus intensity or duration, although as a population DCN neurons showed significantly increasing response amplitudes as air-puff intensity or duration increased. Overall, the responses were characterized by a distinct temporal profile in each neuron, which remained unchanged with changes in stimulus condition. We conclude that the responses in the DCN of rats to air-puff stimuli differ substantially from cerebellar cortical responses in their receptive field properties and do not provide a robust code of tactile stimulus properties. Rather, the characteristic temporal response profile of each neuron may be tuned to control the timing of a specific task to which its output is linked.", "pages": "492-8"}, {"volume": "19", "title": "Expectation enhances autonomic responses to stimulation of the human subthalamic limbic region.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16061491", "authors": ["Lanotte, M", "Lopiano, L", "Torre, E", "Bergamasco, B", "Colloca, L", "Benedetti, F"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Brain, behavior, and immunity", "abstract": "Recent studies show that the placebo component of a treatment can be investigated by administering therapies either overtly or covertly, without the administration of any placebo.

To do this, we mapped the whole subthalamic region, from the dorsal to the ventral part, and recorded both heart rate and sympathetic responses by using spectral analysis of heart rate variability. We found that open stimulations were more effective than hidden ones only in the ventral subthalamic region, whereas no difference between the two conditions was found in the dorsal aspect. By analyzing the stimulus-response curves in the dorsal, middle, and ventral subthalamic regions, we found that the autonomic response threshold was higher in the hidden than open condition for both heart rate and sympathetic responses only in the ventral part. As this ventralmost portion of the subthalamic region is involved in associative-limbic functions, these data suggest that expectation enhances autonomic responses only if these are elicited in the limbic system.

The best characterised group of LFP oscillations is that at 8-30 Hz. This activity is prominent in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus of Parkinsonian patients withdrawn from their dopaminergic medication. Dopaminergic treatments, behaviourally relevant stimuli and voluntary movement suppress it. The available evidence points to the 8-30 Hz activity being essentially antikinetic in character and inversely related to motor processing. Its exaggeration may therefore contribute to the bradykinesia of Parkinson's disease.", "pages": "492-8"}, {"volume": "76", "title": "The first evaluation of brain shift during functional neurosurgery by deformation field analysis.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "12015863", "authors": ["Winkler, D", "Tittgemeyer, M", "Schwarz, J", "Preul, C", "Strecker, K", "Meixensberger, J"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "abstract": "The authors report a case of hemichorea-hemiballism (HC-HB) that was successfully treated using deep brain stimulation (DBS).

The activity of neurons in the basal ganglia of patients with PD tends to be strongly synchronized at frequencies under 30 Hz, leading to oscillatory local field potentials (LFPs). As dopaminergic therapy acutely suppresses this synchronization, we investigated whether this suppression may contribute to LIDs. Accordingly, we sought an inverse correlation between oscillatory synchronization and dyskinesia activity across time. To this end, we recorded pallidal LFPs in two Parkinsonian subjects exhibiting LIDs following surgery for deep brain stimulation. We correlated LFP power with simultaneously recorded EMG from the dyskinetic contralateral upper limb. We found highly significant inverse correlations between the oscillatory LFP activity under 30 Hz and dyskinetic EMG (maximum r = -0.65, P < 0.001 and r = -0.33, P < 0.001 for activities over 13-30 Hz in each subject).

Fourteen PD patients and 20 matched controls participated. Subjects completed several balance and gait tasks (standing with eyes open or closed, on a normal or foam surface; retropulsion test; walking with eyes closed; walking up and down stairs; Get Up and Go test). Postural control was quantified using trunk sway measurements (angle and angular velocity) in the roll and pitch directions. Subjects further performed a pinch grip reaction time task, where we measured isometric grip forces, as well as movement and reaction times. Patients were examined with STN stimulators switched on or off (order randomised across patients), always after a supramaximal levodopa dosage. STN stimulation improved postural control, as reflected by a reduced trunk sway tremor during stance, a reduced duration for all gait tasks, an increased trunk pitch velocity while rising from a chair, and improved roll stability. STN stimulation also improved finger control, as reflected by a reduced time to reach maximum grip force, without altering reaction times and maximum force levels. Improvements in finger control timing did not correlate with reduced task durations during gait. We conclude that STN stimulation affords improvement of postural control in PD, over and above optimal drug treatment. STN stimulation also provides a simultaneous effect on distal and axial motor control.

Electrical stimulation of the pedonculopontine tegmental (PPT) nucleus produced long-lasting (approximately 20 s) periods of desynchronized EEG activity similar to the EEG of awake animals. Intracellularly, PPT stimulation locked the membrane into a depolarized state, similar to the up-states seen during deep anesthesia. During these EEG-activated states, however, the input resistance was higher than that during up-states. Conductance measurements were performed using different methods, which all indicate that EEG-activated states were associated with a synaptic activity dominated by inhibitory conductances. These results were confirmed by computational models of reconstructed pyramidal neurons constrained by the corresponding intracellular recordings. These models indicate that, during EEG-activated states, neocortical neurons are in a high-conductance state consistent with a stochastic integrative mode.

Recently, the targets of DBS for treatment of Parkinson's disease are the thalamus, the Globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The STN-DBS induces improvements in axial motor fluctuation and the on-off phenomenon. The important problem for STN-DBS is that DBS is inserted properly into the STN for good results. The STN is a small body in the deep brain structures. We cannot understand the STN clearly because of its small size and complex shape. The topographical information of deep brain structures has been essential for accurate stereotactic placement of the stimulating electrode of DBS. The target of a deep brain structure is based on the Schaltenbrand and Wahren atlas (S-W atlas). The S-W atlas consists of two-dimensional images such as a coronal section. For this reason, it is difficult to understand localization and the shape of deep brain structures spatially, especially of the subthalamic nucleus on S-W atlas. The three-dimensional image is a useful tool for diagnosis and preoperative planning, because it can easily give neurosurgeons the vivid spatial image of complex structures. We studied a practical use of a three-dimensional atlas of deep brain structures in functional neurosurgery. We devised a three-dimensional atlas to see an image at a free angle on a personal computer. It provided us with more useful information about structures than ones by two-dimentional images. Three-dimensional atlas also helped us make a decision for placement of the deep brain electrode and appropriate electrophysiological recording.", "pages": "492-8"}, {"volume": "64", "title": "Practice parameter: therapies for essential tremor: report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.", "issue": "12", "pmid": "15990470", "authors": ["Zesiewicz, TA", "Elble, R", "Louis, ED", "Hauser, RA", "Sullivan, KL", "Dewey, RB", "Ondo, WG", "Gronseth, GS", "Weiner, WJ", ""], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurology", "abstract": "The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the primary outcome measure in most clinical trials of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapeutics.

The long-term pain alleviation rate was highest with DBS of the PVG/PAG (79%), or the PVG/PAG plus sensory thalamus/internal capsule (87%). Stimulation of the sensory thalamus alone was less effective (58% long-term success) (p < 0.05). DBS was more effective for nociceptive than deafferentation pain (63% vs 47% long-term success; p < 0.01). Long-term success was attained in over 80% of patients with intractable low back pain (failed back surgery) following successful trial stimulation.

Subthalamic local field potential recordings revealed the presence of multiple rhythms, from the classical EEG frequency range (<50 Hz), to surprisingly high frequencies (70 Hz and 300 Hz). Fast rhythms are particularly attractive because of their likely interaction with the excitatory mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation. Here we investigated whether the two rhythms at 70 Hz and at 300 Hz represent distinct modes of operation, and therefore different targets, within the subthalamic nucleus. We retrospectively analyzed the dataset we used to describe the 300 Hz rhythm (Foffani, Priori et al., Brain 126: 2153-2163, 2003) searching for significant 70 Hz oscillations after levodopa administration. Whereas (as previously reported) 300 Hz activity was a consistent feature in the dataset, significant 70 Hz activity was observed in only 2 of 11 nuclei. Therefore, 70 Hz oscillations are not a necessary condition for the presence of 300 Hz oscillations. The two rhythms probably arise from different mechanisms, reflecting different functional and/or spatial aspects of subthalamic pathophysiology.

This 'paired associative stimulation' (PAS) protocol has been used to induce bidirectional changes in excitability in upper limb CM pathways. The present study tested the hypothesis that temporally dependent PAS applied to the common peroneal nerve during the swing phase of walking would induce bidirectional changes in CM excitability consistent with the Hebbian principle of activity-dependent plasticity. Fourteen subjects with no known neurological disorder participated in two data collection sessions each. PAS was delivered as a single block of 120 pairs of stimuli delivered in a 10 min period during treadmill walking at 4.0 km h(-1). Changes in CM excitability were assessed by examining the size of motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation prior to and following PAS. Tibialis anterior motor-evoked potentials amplitude increased to 121% over baseline when the magnetic stimulus was delivered over M1 after the estimated arrival time of the afferent volley in sensorimotor cortex and decreased to 83% of baseline when the magnetic stimulus was delivered prior to the estimated afferent volley arrival. This extent of modulation was undiminished following a further 10 min period of walking without stimulation. The temporal nature of the bidirectional effects following PAS, their rapid evolution and subsequent persistence supported the study's hypothesis and were similar to the effects described by others in quiescent muscles of the upper limb.", "pages": "492-8"}, {"volume": "382", "title": "Frequency dependent effects of subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "1-2", "pmid": "12088467", "authors": ["Fogelson, N", "K\u00fchn, AA", "Silberstein, P", "Limousin, PD", "Hariz, M", "Trottenberg, T", "Kupsch, A", "Brown, P"], "year": "", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is associated with significant improvement of motor complications in patients with severe Parkinson's disease after some 6-12 months of treatment.

Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 1 year and 3-4 years after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the change in the 'off' medication score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) at 3-4 years. Stimulation of the STN or GPi induced a significant improvement (50 and 39%; P < 0.0001) of the 'off' medication UPDRS-III score at 3-4 years with respect to baseline. Stimulation improved cardinal features and activities of daily living (ADL) (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.02 for STN and GPi, respectively) and prolonged the 'on' time spent with good mobility without dyskinesias (P < 0.00001). Daily dosage of levodopa was significantly reduced (35%) in the STN-treated group only (P < 0.001). Comparison of the improvement induced by stimulation at 1 year with 3-4 years showed a significant worsening in the 'on' medication motor states of the UPDRS-III, ADL and gait in both STN and GPi groups, and speech and postural stability in the STN-treated group.
