Here, we clarified the neural relationship between processing and encoding by examining hippocampal-cortical connectivity during deep and shallow encoding. Participants studied words during functional magnetic resonance imaging and freely recalled these words after distraction. Deep study processing led to better recall than shallow study processing. For both levels of processing, successful encoding elicited activations of bilateral hippocampus and left prefrontal cortex, and increased functional connectivity between left hippocampus and bilateral medial prefrontal, cingulate and extrastriate cortices. Successful encoding during deep processing was additionally associated with increased functional connectivity between left hippocampus and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction. In the shallow encoding condition, on the other hand, pronounced functional connectivity increases were observed between the right hippocampus and the frontoparietal attention network activated during shallow study processing.

We reinvestigated this issue by analysing subjective and videotaped behavioural responses to 4160 cortical stimulations using intracerebral electrodes implanted in all cortical lobes that were carried out over 12 years during the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy in 164 consecutive patients. Pain responses were scarce (1.4%) and concentrated in the medial part of the parietal operculum and neighbouring posterior insula where pain thresholds showed a rostrocaudal decrement. This deep cortical region remained largely inaccessible to the intraoperative stimulation of the cortical surface carried out by Penfield after resection of the parietal operculum. It differs also from primary sensory areas described by Penfield et al. in the sense that, with our stimulation paradigm, pain represented only 10% of responses. Like Penfield et al., we obtained no pain response anywhere else in the cortex, including in regions consistently activated by pain in most functional imaging studies, i.e. the first somatosensory area, the lateral part of the secondary somatosensory area, anterior and mid-cingulate gyri (mid-cingulate cortex), anterior frontal, posterior parietal and supplementary motor areas.

In order to further elucidate the modulatory effect of the PPTg on the STN we examined the effect of 25 Hz low frequency PPTg stimulation on neuronal single unit activity and oscillatory local field potentials (LFPs) of the STN, and on the electrocorticogram (ECoG) of the primary motor cortex region in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA induced nigrostriatal lesions. Stimulation of the PPTg reduced the enhanced firing rate in the STN, without affecting the firing pattern or approximate entropy (ApEn). It also reduced the activity in the beta band (15-30 Hz) of the STN, which is elevated in 6-OHDA lesioned rats, without affecting beta activity in the motor cortex. We showed a modulatory effect of PPTg stimulation on altered neuronal STN activity in the PD 6-OHDA rat model, indicating that PPTg DBS may alter activity of the basal ganglia circuitry at least partially.

We assessed the quality of clinical trials and levels of evidence, and referred to other treatment guidelines proposed by other countries. Throughout several panel discussions, we merged opinions from the subcommittee members and proposed a consensus on the major roles, recommended levels, clinical efficacy, adverse events and cautions of clinical practice regarding acute and preventive treatments of cluster headache. The majority of Taiwanese patients have episodic cluster headaches, because chronic clusters are very rare. Cluster headache is characterized by severe and excruciating pain which develops within a short time and is associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms. Therefore, emergency treatment for a cluster headache attack is extremely important. Within the group of acute medications currently available in Taiwan, the subcommittee determined that high-flow oxygen inhalation has the best evidence of effectiveness, followed by intranasal triptans. Both are recommended as first-line medical treatments for acute attacks. Oral triptans were determined to be second-line medications. For transitional prophylaxis, oral corticosteroids are recommended as the first-line medication, and ergotamine as the second-line choice. As for maintenance prophylaxis, verapamil has the best evidence and is recommended as the first-line medication. Lithium, melatonin, valproic acid, topiramate and gabapentin are suggested as the second-line preventive medications. Surgical interventions, including occipital nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, radiofrequency block of the sphenopalatine ganglion, percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy and trigeminal nerve section, are invasive and their long-term efficacy and adverse events are still not clear in Taiwanese patients; therefore, they are not recommended currently by the subcommittee.

According to our results, the pulse shapes considered showed a considerably increased efficiency in terms of both activation and entrainment of neural activity.

However, targeting this small anatomical structure is rendered difficult due to a series of brain shifts that take place during and after the procedure. This paper introduces a biomechanical simulation of the intra and postoperative stages of the procedure in order to determine lead deformation and electrode migration due to brain shift. To achieve this goal, we propose a global approach, which accounts for brain deformation but also for the numerous interactions that take place during the procedure (contacts between the brain and the inner part of the skull and falx cerebri, effect of the cerebro-spinal fluid, and biomechanical interactions between the brain and the electrodes and cannula used during the procedure).

Our results indicate that in the parkinsonian state the abnormal neuronal oscillatory activity in the 10-15 Hz range is coherent within and between nuclei. We further show that STN macro-stimulation results in a reduction of oscillatory activity in the globus pallidus. In addition, a functional decoupling of the STN from its pallidal targets is evidenced by the reduced STN-GPi coherence, that effectively removes the STN synchronous oscillatory drive of basal ganglia output. This decoupling results in reduced coherence between neurons within the GPi which resume an independent neuronal activity pattern.

Previous studies indicate that high-frequency stimulation is less effective when the stimulation train is temporally irregular. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific characteristics of temporally irregular stimulus trains that reduce their effectiveness: long pauses, bursts, or irregularity per se. We isolated these characteristics in stimulus trains and conducted intraoperative measurements of postural tremor in eight volunteers. Tremor varied significantly across stimulus conditions (P < 0.015), and stimulus trains with pauses were significantly less effective than stimulus trains without (P < 0.002). There were no significant differences in tremor between trains with or without bursts or between trains that were irregular or periodic. Thus the decreased effectiveness of temporally irregular DBS trains is due to long pauses in the stimulus trains, not the degree of temporal irregularity alone. We also conducted computer simulations of neuronal responses to the experimental stimulus trains using a biophysical model of the thalamic network. Trains that suppressed tremor in volunteers also suppressed fluctuations in thalamic transmembrane potential at the frequency associated with cerebellar burst-driver inputs. Clinical and computational findings indicate that DBS suppresses tremor by masking burst-driver inputs to the thalamus and that pauses in stimulation prevent such masking. Although stimulation of other anatomic targets may provide tremor suppression, we propose that the most relevant neuronal targets for effective tremor suppression are the afferent cerebellar fibers that terminate in the thalamus.", "pages": "923-38"}, {"volume": "32", "title": "Therapeutic high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease produces global increases in cerebral blood flow.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "11802915", "authors": ["Sidtis, JJ", "Tagliati, M", "Alterman, R", "Sidtis, D", "Dhawan, V", "Eidelberg, D"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "abstract": "Hemidystonia is a unilateral clinical presentation of dystonia, and it is usually refractory to current methods of medical treatment.
