This article presents the results of an analysis of the combined published results of individual patient outcomes following DBS for all types of dystonia. From 157 papers reporting clinical outcomes of DBS for dystonia, individual quantitative data were available for 466 patients with all forms of dystonia. The subclassification of these patients included 344 with primary forms of dystonia, 10 with myoclonus dystonia, 19 with heredodegenerative dystonias and 93 who had DBS for secondary dystonia. Patients with primary forms of dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, subtypes of heredo-degenerative dystonia and tardive dystonia have a greater than 50% mean improvement in dystonia severity following DBS. Among patients with primary generalised dystonia, multiple regression analysis showed that a shorter duration of symptoms (p=0.008), a lower baseline severity score (p=0.024) and DYT1 positive status (p=0.002) were all independently associated with a significantly higher percentage improvement from surgery. Patients with other forms of heredodegenerative and secondary dystonia have variable responses, making prediction of response in future patients difficult. The degree of dystonia response that justifies DBS is a highly subjective issue. Emphasis should be placed on both safety of surgical technique and an in-depth evaluation of patients' own perception of their life before and after DBS by using validated quality of life measures, in addition to existing use of objective severity scales.", "pages": "1383-9"}, {"volume": "186", "title": "Temporo-parietal junction stimulation in the treatment of depersonalization disorder.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "20837362", "authors": ["Mantovani, A", "Simeon, D", "Urban, N", "Bulow, P", "Allart, A", "Lisanby, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Psychiatry research", "abstract": "This is the first clinical trial of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in depersonalization disorder (DPD).

Further, we tested whether this fear-like behaviour could be attenuated by acute or chronic administration of buspirone and escitalopram. Our data demonstrate for the first time that animals showed fear-like behaviour 12 h after dlPAG stimulation, which may possibly reflect panic disorder with anticipatory anxiety/agoraphobic symptoms. Acute and chronic escitalopram, but not buspirone, treatment attenuated the fear-related behaviour. Besides, our data also showed that the stimulation intensities to evoke an escape reaction, a panicogenic response, were significantly higher after chronic buspirone and escitalopram treatment.

Neurology", "abstract": "The local strength of pathological synchronization in the region of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is emerging as a possible factor in the motor impairment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In particular, correlations have been repeatedly demonstrated between treatment-induced suppressions of local oscillatory activity in the beta frequency band and improvements in motor performance. However, a mechanistic role for beta activity is brought into question by the difficulty in showing a correlation between such activity at rest and the motor deficit in patients withdrawn from medication. Here we recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from 36 subthalamic regions in 18 patients undergoing functional neurosurgery for the treatment of PD. We recorded directly from the contacts of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes as they were introduced in successive 2 mm steps, and assessed phase coherence as a measure of spatially extended, rather than local, oscillatory synchronization. We found that phase coherence in the beta frequency band correlated with the severity of Parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity, both in the limbs and axial body. Such correlations were frequency and site specific in so far as they were reduced when the lowermost contact of the DBS electrode was above the dorsal STN. Correlations with limb tremor occurred at sub-beta band frequencies and were more lateralized than those between beta activity and limb bradykinesia and rigidity. Phase coherence could account for up to \u223c25% of the variance in motor scores between sides and patients. These new data suggest that the strength of spatially extended oscillatory synchronization, as well as the strength of local synchronization, may be worthwhile incorporating into modelling studies designed to inform surgical targeting, post-operative stimulation parameter selection and closed-loop stimulation regimes in PD.

Using motor evoked potentials (MEP) elicited by intracortical microstimulation, we now show the effect of LCN stimulation on motor cortex excitability as a function of pulse frequency in propofol-anesthetized rats. MEPs were recorded serially, at 15-s intervals, with cerebellar stimulation delivered in 10-min blocks at rates of 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 Hz. Stimulation at 20, 30, 40 or 50 Hz enhanced the average MEP response across the block, with the maximal overall increase observed during 30 Hz stimulation. However, the effect varied as a function of both repeated trials within the block and LCN stimulation frequency, such that 40 Hz and 50 Hz stimulation showed a reduced effect over time. Stimulation at 100 Hz produced a transient increase in MEP amplitude in some animals; however the overall effect across the block was a trend towards reduced cortical excitability.

In such patients various neurostimulation methods have been proposed, ranging from invasive procedures such as deep-brain stimulation to minimally invasive ones like occipital nerve stimulation. They have been applied in single cases or small series of patients affected with varying headache disorders: cervicogenic headache, hemicrania continua, posttraumatic headache, chronic migraine, and cluster headache. Although favorable results were reported overall, it is premature to consider neurostimulation as a treatment with established utility in refractory headaches. At present, the most detailed clinical studies have been performed in intractable chronic cluster headache (iCCH) patients, who represent about 1% of all chronic cluster headache (CCH) patients. Various lesional interventions have been attempted in these patients, none with lasting benefits. In recent years, non-destructive neurostimulation methods have raised new hope. Hypothalamic deep-brain stimulation (hDBS) acts rapidly and has lasting efficacy, but is not without risk. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) was studied in two trials on a total of 17 iCCH patients. Clinical efficacy was found to be very satisfactory by most patients and by the investigators. Although slightly less efficacious than hDBS, ONS has the advantage of being rather harmless and reversible. At this stage, it should be preferred as first-line invasive therapy for iCCH.

In this chapter we discuss the aim and the choice of prevention. Verapamil is considered the first choice for prevention of cluster headache, but as with all of the medications to be mentioned, it has various adverse effects to be aware of. Other frequently used preventives for cluster include lithium carbonate, methysergide where available, methylergonovine, clonidine, melatonin, valproate, gabapentin, topiramate, and others. Several other medications can be used as bridge therapy, to decrease the frequency of cluster temporarily, giving time for the preventives to begin to work. The most commonly used bridge therapies are 7-21 days of prednisone at high and then tapering doses and ergots such as ergotamine tartrate and dihydroergotamine. Patients with chronic cluster headache who are unresponsive to all medical therapies can be considered for occipital nerve stimulation and various surgical procedures such as ganglyogliolysis of all three branches of the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone. A somewhat controversial but highly successful procedure, at least as done by the neurosurgeons in Professor Bussone's group at the Institute of Neurology in Milan, has been deep-brain stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus.

We tested our hypothesis using hippocampal slices (in vitro studies) from TgCRND8 mice to evaluate whether HFS increases \u03b1-secretase activity (non-amyloidogenic pathway) in the CA1 region. In a second set of experiments, we performed in vivo studies to evaluate whether DBS in midline thalamic region re-establishes hippocampal dependent short-term memory in TgCRND8 mice. The results showed that application of HFS to isolated hippocampal slices significantly increased synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region and promoted a 2-fold increase of non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase activity, in comparison to low frequency stimulated controls from TgCRND8 mice. In the in vivo studies, DBS treatment facilitated acquisition of object recognition memory in TgCRND8 mice, in comparison to their own baseline before treatment.

Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the dynamics of such networks and the conditions under which a high level of synchronization can be observed. One of the key factors that influences the level of synchronization is the type of learning rule that governs synaptic plasticity. Most of the existing work on synchronization in recurrent networks with synaptic plasticity are based on numerical simulations and there is a clear lack of a theoretical framework for studying the effects of various synaptic plasticity rules. In this paper we derive analytically the conditions for spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to lead a network into a synchronized or a desynchronized state. We also show that under appropriate conditions bistability occurs in recurrent networks governed by STDP. Indeed, a pathological regime with strong connections and therefore strong synchronized activity, as well as a physiological regime with weaker connections and lower levels of synchronization are found to coexist. Furthermore, we show that with appropriate stimulation, the network dynamics can be pushed to the low synchronization stable state. This type of therapeutical stimulation is very different from the existing high-frequency stimulation for deep brain stimulation since once the stimulation is stopped the network stays in the low synchronization regime.", "pages": "1383-9"}, {"volume": "258", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for camptocormia in dystonia and Parkinson's disease.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16809569", "authors": ["Capelle, HH", "Schrader, C", "Blahak, C", "Fogel, W", "Kinfe, TM", "Baezner, H", "Krauss, JK"], "year": "2011", "journal": "Journal of neurology", "abstract": "Spatial patterns of spontaneous neural activity at rest have previously been associated with specific networks in the brain, including those pertaining to the functional architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1).

We used a linear microelectrode array to measure LFP signals at multiple, evenly spaced positions throughout the cortical thickness. Analyzing both the mean LFP amplitudes and between-contact LFP coherences, we identified two distinct zones of activity, roughly corresponding to superficial and deep layers, divided by a sharp transition near the bottom of layer 4. The LFP signals within each laminar zone were highly coherent, whereas those between zones were not. This functional compartmentalization was found not only during rest, but also when the receptive field was stimulated during a visual task.

Prospective studies have shown that although the beneficial effects of this procedure are maintained at 5 years, axial motor features and cognitive decline may occur in the long term after the implants. In order to address some unsolved questions raised by previous studies, we evaluated a series of 20 consecutive patients who received continuous stimulation for 8 years. The overall motor improvement reported at 5 years (55.5% at Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor part, P < 0.001 compared with baseline) was only partly retained 3 years later (39%, P < 0.001, compared with baseline; -16.5%, P < 0.01, compared with 5 years), with differential effects on motor features: speech did not improve and postural stability worsened (P < 0.05). The preoperative levodopa equivalent daily dose was reduced by 58.2% at 5 years and by 60.3% at 8 years. In spite of subtle worsening of motor features, a dramatic impairment in functional state (-56.6% at Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Activities of Daily Living, P < 0.01) emerged after the fifth year of stimulation. The present study did not reveal a predictive value of preoperative levodopa response, whereas few single features at baseline (such as gait and postural stability motor scores and the preoperative levodopa equivalent daily dose) could predict long-term motor outcome. A decline in verbal fluency (slightly more pronounced than after 5 years) was detected after 8 years. A significant but slight decline in tasks of abstract reasoning, episodic memory and executive function was also found. One patient had developed dementia at 5 years with further progression at 8 years. Executive dysfunction correlated significantly with postural stability, suggesting interplay between axial motor deterioration and cognition. Eight years after surgery, no significant change was observed on scales assessing depression or anxiety when compared with baseline. At 8 years, there was no significant increase of side-effects when compared with 5-year follow-up. In conclusion, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is a safe procedure with regard to cognitive and behavioural morbidity over long-term follow-up.

Trains of 1 Hz rTMS applied either over the supplementary motor area (SMA) or the primary motor cortex (M1) were able to induce a transient reduction in the severity of LID, confirming that an over-activity of these areas plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of LID. However, repeated sessions of rTMS were not effective in inducing persistent beneficial clinical effects.

The objective of this study was to assess the physiological basis for this dissociation and to test our hypothesis that the underlying etiology of this paradox is activation of fibers of the internal capsule.

Consistent with our observations in humans, this near-threshold stimulation was found to improve rigidity while bradykinesia and akinesia worsened.

The in vitro yet intact cerebellum was first immersed in voltage-sensitive dye and its responses while intact were compared to those measured in thick cerebellar slices. Each slice is stained throughout its depth, even though the pial half appeared darker during epi-illumination and lighter during trans-illumination. Optical responses were shown to be mediated by the voltage-sensitive dye because the evoked signals had opposite polarity for 540- and 710-nm light, but no response to 850-nm light. Molecular layer stimulation of the intact cerebellum evoked slow transverse beams. Similar beams were observed in the molecular layer of thick transverse slices but not sagittal slices. With low currents, beams in transverse slices were restricted to sublayers within the molecular layer, conducting slowly away from the stimulus site. These excitatory beams were observed nearly all the way across the turtle cerebellum, distances of 4-6mm. Microstimulation of the granule cell layer of both transverse or sagittal slices evoked a local membrane depolarization restricted to a radial wedge, but these radial responses did not activate measurable molecular layer beams in transverse slices. White matter microstimulation in sagittal slices (near the ventricular surface of the turtle cerebellum) activated the granule cell and Purkinje cell layers, but not the molecular layer. These responses were nearly synchronous, were primarily caudal to the stimulation, and were blocked by cobalt ions. Therefore, synaptic responses in all cerebellar layers contribute to optical signals recorded in intact cerebellum in vitro (Brown and Ariel, 2009). Rapid radial signaling connects a sagittally-oriented, fast-conduction system of the deep layers with the transverse-oriented, slow-conducting molecular layer, thereby permitting complex temporal processing between two tangential but orthogonal paths in the cerebellar cortex.", "pages": "1383-9"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Development of intraoperative electrochemical detection: wireless instantaneous neurochemical concentration sensor for deep brain stimulation feedback.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15257220", "authors": ["Van Gompel, JJ", "Chang, SY", "Goerss, SJ", "Kim, IY", "Kimble, C", "Bennet, KE", "Lee, KH"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the ground reaction force (GRF) for evaluating the deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) effects in Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects with and without medication.", "pages": "1383-9"}, {"volume": "29", "title": "Long-term follow-up of deep brain stimulation for Meige syndrome.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15269959", "authors": ["Lyons, MK", "Birch, BD", "Hillman, RA", "Boucher, OK", "Evidente, VG"], "year": "2010", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "abstract": "Ten subjects who underwent DBS-STN were evaluated under the following four conditions: without treatment (mof-sof), with stimulation (mof-son), with medication (mon-sof), and with both treatments (mon-son).

Four patients were also studied at the elbow joint. Patients with PD originally received unilateral STN DBS between years 2001 and 2003. They were re-evaluated after 5 years of long-term STN DBS between years 2006-2008. At baseline (year 0) and after 5 years, patients with PD were tested off treatment and on STN DBS. In each testing condition, patients performed ballistic, single degree of freedom ankle dorsiflexion and ankle plantarflexion movements and peak velocity was calculated. Patients also performed maximal voluntary contractions at the ankle joint in both directions, and peak torque was calculated. Results showed increased motor UPDRS scores from year 0 to year 5, but STN DBS was efficacious in reducing them. In contrast to the increase in motor UPDRS scores, motor control results showed a marked improvement in peak velocity and peak torque over the 5-year time period in the off treatment condition, and STN DBS was efficacious by improving both peak velocity and peak torque.
