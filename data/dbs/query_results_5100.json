Furthermore, STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) also improved response preparation as shown by the significant improvement of the RT performance in the SRT task. This effect of STN DBS on the RT performance in the SRT task was greater as compared with the CRT task. This is due to the more complex information processing that is required in the CRT task as compared to the SRT task.

Principally due to the observation of long-term clinical effects over a period up to 15 years, it is clear that the mechanism is not due to a progressive lesion, as at every moment the interruption of stimulation reverses totally the effects. There is no current proof that long-term HFS is able to reset neural networks, or to induce profound modifications of the functional organization or of the synaptic connectivity. To understand what is responsible for the immediate, reversible and adaptable effects of HFS, several mechanisms must be considered, which might be involved simultaneously or in sequence: i) Jamming of neural transmission through stimulated nuclei is one possibility, based on the principle that the regular imposed activity might drive the neurons to fire in a regular pattern, making it impossible to transmit more subtle messages, either normal or abnormal. Although it is difficult to prove this type of mechanism, it might account for the reports of increased activity following HFS in various structures. ii) Direct inhibition of spike initiation at the level of the membrane could be due to activation of inhibitory terminals, particularly gaba-ergic, or by a blockade of the voltage gated ion channels. iii) Recent data show that HFS decreases the production and release of low molecular weight proteic neurotransmitters, which could account for the functional inhibition while the efferent axon is still excited by the electrical stimulus. iv) Retrograde activation of upstream neuronal structures, as reported in the external pallidum during stimulation of STN, might be responsible of additional jamming-like effects due to collisions with descending spikes.", "pages": "1713-6"}, {"volume": "103", "title": "Thalamic deep brain stimulation for management of essential tremor.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "14639677", "authors": ["Lee, JY", "Kondziolka, D"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "Once it was believed that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was no more than a relay station serving as a \"gate\" for ascending basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. Nowadays, the STN is considered to be one of the main regulators of motor function related to the basal ganglia. The role of the STN in the regulation of associative and limbic functions related to the basal ganglia has generally received little attention. In the present review, the functional role of the STN in the control of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical associative and limbic circuits is discussed. In the past 20 years the concepts about the functional role of the STN have changed dramatically: from being an inhibitory nucleus to a potent excitatory nucleus, and from being involved in hyperkinesias to hypokinesias. However, it has been demonstrated only recently, mainly by reports on the behavioral (side-) effects of STN deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is a popular surgical technique in the treatment of patients suffering from advanced Parkinson Disease (PD), that the STN is clinically involved in associative and limbic functions. These findings were confirmed by results from animal studies. Experimental studies applying STN DBS or STN lesions to investigate the neuronal mechanisms involved in these procedures found profound effects on cognitive and motivational parameters. The anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral data presented in this review point towards a potent regulatory function of the STN in the processing of associative and limbic information towards cortical and subcortical regions. In conclusion, it can be stated that the STN has anatomically a central position within the basal ganglia thalamocortical associative and limbic circuits and is functionally a potent regulator of these pathways.", "pages": "1713-6"}, {"volume": "103", "title": "Deep brain stimulation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "16289053", "authors": ["Roberts, DW"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "abstract": "In detailed simulations we present a coordinated delayed feedback stimulation as a particularly robust and mild technique for desynchronization.

This sensory input determines most of the properties of first order thalamic neurons, and so is said to drive, rather than modulate, these neurons. This holds as a rule for first order thalamic nuclei, but in contrast, higher order thalamic nuclei receive much of their driver input back from cerebral cortex. In addition, higher order thalamic neurons receive inputs from subcortical movement-related centers. In the terminology popularized from studies of the sensory system, can we consider these ascending motor inputs to thalamus from subcortical structures to be modulators, subtly influencing the activity of their target neurons, or drivers, dictating the activity of their target neurons? This chapter summarizes relevant evidence from neuronal recording, inactivation, and stimulation of pathways projecting from the superior colliculus through thalamus to cerebral cortex. The study concludes that many inputs to the higher order nuclei of the thalamus from subcortical oculomotor areas - from the superior colliculus and probably other midbrain and pontine regions - should be regarded as motor drivers analogous to the sensory drivers at the first order thalamic nuclei. These motor drivers at the thalamus are viewed as being at the top of a series of feedback loops that provide information on impending actions, just as sensory drivers provide information about the external environment.", "pages": "1713-6"}, {"volume": "95", "title": "Psychophysical elements of place and modality specificity in the thalamic somatic sensory nucleus (ventral caudal, vc) of awake humans.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16238262", "authors": ["Patel, S", "Ohara, S", "Dougherty, PM", "Gracely, RH", "Lenz, FA"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed the development of new physical techniques in neurology and psychiatry, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).

In thalamotomy, a minimal radiofrequency lesion created within the lateral portion of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim) often affords the best control of parkinsonian tremor, supporting the assumption that there is a concentrated cluster of cells within this area which is responsible for tremor. However, this assumption may not always be true; such neural elements sometimes appear to spread out across wide areas. Cells with tremor-frequency activity are widely distributed over the areas extending from the Vim to the nuclei ventralis oralis posterior and anterior (Vop and Voa). All of these cells appear to be more or less involved in tremor generation, especially in patients with essential tremor and post-stroke tremor. In contrast to radiofrequency lesions for thalamotomy, electrodes for DBS can be arranged in such a way that wide areas can be stimulated, if necessary. For this purpose, it is critically important to determine optimal placement and orientation of DBS leads for arranging the electrodes to yield maximal benefits in patients with tremor.", "pages": "1713-6"}, {"volume": "16", "title": "Somatosensory and pain responses to stimulation of the second somatosensory area (SII) in humans.

It is known that tactile signals can be modulated in certain behavioral contexts, but it is still unresolved to what degree this modulation is related to movement kinematics and whether it stems from tactile receptors or from central sources. Using awake, head-fixed rats, trained to contact an object, we measured trajectories of muscle-propelled whisker movement precisely and compared tactile responses to contacts thus accomplished with 'passive' contacts (motionless whisker contacted by object). Multielectrode extracellular recordings in deep layers of barrel cortex revealed that when the animals moved their whiskers actively, tactile processing switched from high response amplitudes, wide cortical representation and low background firing, to low response amplitudes, narrow spatial representation and elevated background firing. Switching was fast (<100 ms) and unrelated to the degree of alertness as assessed by spectral analysis of pre-contact field potentials. Switching persisted when information about whisker kinematics was interrupted by transection of the infraorbital nerve and contacts were mimicked by peripheral electrical stimulation.

No asymmetries in space orientation were found when both stimulators were switched OFF, when both stimulators were switched ON, and when only the right stimulator was switched ON. When only the left subthalamic stimulation was switched ON, the reaction times of both hands to visual stimuli in the left extra-personal hemispace increased significantly and the line bisection test showed a significant orientation to the right.

Surface and deep EEG recordings were obtained for 3 days before implantation of the macroelectrodes and for 4 days after implantation of the macroelectrodes but before implantation of the stimulator battery. Results.\u2002 Paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded in the right MB while other surface and deep recordings, in particular from the right MTT, were silent. When these discharges were longer than 100 sec, they spread to the right MTT area and then to the left MB and MTT area. Simultaneously, the patient became agitated and confused.

Brain research reviews", "abstract": "Discrete anatomic structures in the monkey somatic sensory thalamus may segregate input arising from different peripheral receptors and from different parts of the body. It has been proposed that these structures serve as components of modality- and place-specific pathways from the periphery to the cortex. We now test this hypothesis by examining the modality- and place-specific segregation of sensations at sites where microstimulation (microA currents) within the region of ventral caudal (Vc; human principal somatic sensory nucleus) evokes somatic sensations. Microstimulation was delivered in an ascending staircase protocol consisting of different numbers of pulses (4-100) presented at different frequencies (10-200 Hz) during awake thalamic surgery for movement disorders. The results demonstrate that the part of the body where microstimulation evoked sensation (projected field) and the descriptors of nonpainful sensations were usually uniform across the staircase. These results strongly support the existence of psychophysical elements of place and modality specificity in the Vc thalamus. The proportion of sites at which the sensation included more than one part of the body almost always stayed constant over current intervals (plateaus) of 10 microA. Similar plateaus were not found for sites with more than one descriptor, suggesting that elements of modality-specificity are smaller than and located within those for place-specificity. The intensity of sensations varied with the number of stimulation pulses for mechanical/tingle and cool sensations. The results provide strong evidence for psychophysically defined elements that are responsible for modality specificity of nonpainful sensations, place specificity, and intensity coding of somatic sensation in the human thalamus.", "pages": "1713-6"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Deep brain stimulation to treat hyperkinetic symptoms of Cockayne syndrome.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16205108", "authors": ["Hebb, MO", "Gaudet, P", "Mendez, I"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "Somatosensory and pain responses to direct intracerebral stimulations of the SII area were obtained in 14 patients referred for epilepsy surgery. Stimulations were delivered using transopercular electrodes exploring the parietal opercular cortex (SII area), the suprasylvian parietal cortex (SI area) and the insular cortex. SII responses were compared to those from adjacent SI and insular cortex. In the three areas we elicited mostly somatosensory responses, including paresthesiae, temperature and pain sensations. The rate of painful sensations (10%) was similar in SII and in the insula, while no painful sensation was evoked in SI. A few non-somatosensory responses were evoked by SII stimulation. Conversely various types of non-somatosensory responses (auditory, vegetative, vestibular, olfacto-gustatory, etc.) were evoked only by insular stimulation, confirming that SII, like SI, are mostly devoted to the processing of somatosensory inputs whereas the insular cortex is a polymodal area. We also found differences in size and lateralization of skin projection fields of evoked sensations between the three studied areas, showing a spatial resolution of the somatotopic map in SII intermediate between those found in SI and insula. This study shows the existence of three distinct somatosensory maps in the suprasylvian, opercular and insular regions, and separate pain representations in SII and insular cortex.", "pages": "1713-6"}, {"volume": "21", "title": "Staged bilateral stereotactic pallidothalamotomy for life-threatening dystonia in a child with Hallervorden-Spatz disease.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "16205106", "authors": ["Balas, I", "Kovacs, N", "Hollody, K"], "year": "2006", "journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "abstract": "High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective for treating refractory idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD).
