When the stimulating and recording electrodes are in saline in the same plane and same depth, the shapes of the recorded voltage and stimulating current are similar. The shape of the recorded voltage significantly changes when the recording electrode is in the stratum radiatum of CA1. The signal recorded in the first 2 ms, before the presynaptic volley, indicates the existence of a fast response shown as a positive deflection. For times slightly longer than the stimulating pulse width, the fast response overlaps with the voltage induced by the discharging of the polarization charge accumulated in the double layer capacitance at the interface between metal and saline. For times longer than about 1.4 ms the fast response and presynaptic volley are superimposed. The fast response is about 0.5 mV when the stimulating charge is 15-25 nC. The demonstration that the fast response disappears upon bath perfusion of tetrodotoxin is convincing support for its axonal origin.

The vasoactive neuropeptide is released by afferent neurones originating in the peripherally located trigeminal ganglion supplying the dura mater. The role of CGRP in migraine is further supported by recently released data showing that the CGRP-antagonist BIBN4096BS is clinically effective for the treatment of migraine headaches. Yet, the trigger for CGRP release during migraine attacks is not identified. It is suggested that the peripheral CGRP release during a migraine attack might be either triggered by direct activation of afferent dural neurones, or, by indirect activation via the central nervous system. Recently, we were able to show that the CGRP-antagonist BIBN4096BS is able to inhibit vasodilation induced by trigeminal ganglion stimulation. Now, we extend our studies to the investigation of facial blood flow changes induced by electrical stimulation of the brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). Here, we show that stimulation of the TNC leads to a pronounced increase of facial blood flow. The nicotinic antagonist Hexamethonium reduced the evoked flow by approximately 50% (30 mg/kg), while the muscarinic antagonist Atropin did not influence the stimulation evoked blood flow. Application of BIBN4096BS (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) diminished the evoked flow almost completely. Therefore, we conclude that CGRP represents the key player in TNC-induced facial vasodilation, while activation of nicotinic receptors modulates centrally induced peripheral neurogenic vasodilation.", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "1", "title": "Adaptive autoregressive identification with spectral power decomposition for studying movement-related activity in scalp EEG signals and basal ganglia local field potentials.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15876636", "authors": ["Foffani, G", "Bianchi, AM", "Priori, A", "Baselli, G"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "abstract": "We performed thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery to treat severe essential tremor in a 36 year-old woman who had undergone cadaveric renal transplant four years earlier.

We applied the method to analyze movement-related EEG signals and LFPs contemporarily recorded from the sensorimotor cortex, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in a patient with Parkinson's disease who underwent stereotactic neurosurgery for the implant of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes.

Recently, phase synchronization (PS) analysis was applied to quantify the partial synchrony that exists in complex chaotic or noisy systems. In a previous study, we have shown that neural activity between two remotely located sites can be synchronized through a complete cut of the tissue by endogenous non-synaptic signals. Therefore, it should be possible to apply signals to control PS. In this study, we test the hypothesis that stimulation amplitudes below excitation level (sub-threshold) can be used to control phase synchronization of two neural signals and we investigate the underlying mechanisms. PS of neuronal activity is first analysed in two coupled Rossler neuron models. Both synchronization and desynchronization could be generated with sub-threshold sinusoidal stimulation. Phase synchronization was then studied in in vitro brain slices. Neuronal activity between two sites was modulated by the application of small sinusoidal electric fields. PS between two remote sites could be achieved by the application of two identical waveforms while phase desynchronization of two close sites was generated by the application of a stimulus at a single site. These results show that sub-threshold stimuli are able to phase synchronize or desynchronize two networks and suggest that small signals could play an important role in normal neural activity and epilepsy.", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "11", "title": "Benign essential blepharospasm.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15860145", "authors": ["Whitney, CM"], "year": "2005", "journal": "The neurologist", "abstract": "The authors report the results of long-term bilateral high-frequency pallidal stimulation in two patients affected by neuroleptic-induced dystonia.

The second patient, a 30-year-old man, presented with a torsion dystonia, spasmodic torticollis, and involuntary movements of the upper limbs, which appeared after 4 years of neuroleptic treatment. Both of these dystonias worsened even after the neuroleptic treatment had been discontinued, and neither patient responded to clozapine or benzodiazepine therapy.

In each case bilateral stereotactic implantation of electrodes within the globus pallidus internus (GPI) was performed while the patient was in a state of general anesthesia. The electrodes were placed at the following anterior commissure-posterior commissure line-related coordinates: 20 mm lateral to the midline, 6 mm below the intercommissural plane, and 3 mm anterior to the midcommissural point. Electrical stimulation (130 Hz, 1 V, 90 microsec) was begun on the 1st postoperative day. In both patients, a genetic analysis positively ruled out a mutation in the DYT1 gene, and magnetic resonance imaging yielded normal findings in both cases.

We found that the bradykinesia in Parkinsonian subjects improved by both levodopa medication and STN stimulation. As compared to healthy subjects, excessive grip force was observed in all Parkinson subjects, regardless of the treatment condition. This force excess was most pronounced in the on-drug condition and ameliorated by STN stimulation. We observed reliable correlations between the amount of force overflow and the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in the on-drug condition. Despite some similarities regarding therapeutic effects on bradykinesia, our findings contrast with earlier observations with respect to the differential effects of levodopa and STN stimulation on the scaling of fingertip forces in Parkinson's disease. While levodopa causes an overshoot of fingertip forces, STN stimulation appears to be sufficient to alleviate, but not normalise the force excess.

Animals were trained in four consecutive days (8 trials/day) in the non-visible platform condition except in the fourth day in which only 4 trials were performed followed by a probe trial in which the escape platform was removed. On day 5 of training 8 trials with visible platform were performed. After each of the first 3 training days one group of animals received trains of electrical stimulation to the BLA, while control groups were not stimulated.

The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (< or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning.", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "A walk through the management of Parkinson s disease.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "15376477", "authors": ["Lim, E"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore", "abstract": "Deep-brain electrical or transcranial magnetic stimulation may represent a therapeutic tool for controlling seizures in patients presenting with epileptic disorders resistant to antiepileptic drugs. In keeping with this clinical evidence, we have reported that repetitive electrical stimuli delivered at approximately 1 Hz in mouse hippocampus-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices depress the EC ability to generate ictal activity induced by the application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP) or Mg(2+)-free medium (Barbarosie, M., Avoli, M., 1997. CA3-driven hippocampal-entorhinal loop controls rather than sustains in vitro limbic seizures. J. Neurosci. 17, 9308-9314.). Here, we confirmed a similar control mechanism in rat brain slices analyzed with field potential recordings during 4AP (50 microM) treatment. In addition, we used intrinsic optical signal (IOS) recordings to quantify the intensity and spatial characteristics of this inhibitory influence. IOSs reflect the changes in light transmittance throughout the entire extent of the slice, and are thus reliable markers of limbic network epileptiform synchronization. First, we found that in the presence of 4AP, the IOS increases, induced by a train of electrical stimuli (10 Hz for 1 s) or by recurrent, single-shock stimulation delivered at 0.05 Hz in the deep EC layers, are reduced in intensity and area size by low-frequency (1 Hz), repetitive stimulation of the subiculum; these effects were observed in all limbic areas contained in the slice. Second, by testing the effects induced by repetitive subicular stimulation at 0.2-10 Hz, we identified maximal efficacy when repetitive stimuli are delivered at 1 Hz. Finally, we discovered that similar, but slightly less pronounced, inhibitory effects occur when repetitive stimuli at 1 Hz are delivered in the EC, suggesting that the reduction of IOSs seen during repetitive stimulation is pathway dependent as well as activity dependent. Thus, the activation of limbic networks at low frequency reduces the intensity and spatial extent of the IOS changes that accompany ictal synchronization in an in vitro slice preparation. This conclusion supports the view that repetitive stimulation may represent a potential therapeutic tool for controlling seizures in patients with pharmaco-resistant epileptic disorders.", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "1039", "title": "Vestibular cortical area in the periarcuate cortex: its afferent and efferent projections.", "issue": "", "pmid": "1607973", "authors": ["Sugiuchi, Y", "Izawa, Y", "Ebata, S", "Shinoda, Y"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "abstract": "To determine effects of dopaminergic medication and pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) on skilled reach in Parkinson's disease (PD).", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "116", "title": "Temporal excitation properties of paresthesias evoked by thalamic microstimulation.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "8592222", "authors": ["Grill, WM", "Simmons, AM", "Cooper, SE", "Miocinovic, S", "Montgomery, EB", "Baker, KB", "Rezai, AR"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "abstract": "PD is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor control.

In the present study, the effects of bilateral STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor and cognitive performance were investigated in a rat model of Parkinson disease (PD). After being trained in a choice reaction time (CRT) task, rats received bilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the striatum. One group of 6-OHDA animals was implanted bilaterally with stimulation electrodes at the level of the STN. Stimulations were performed at 130 Hz (frequency), 60 micros (pulse width), and varying amplitudes of 1, 3, 30, and 150 microA during the CRT task. Finally, rats were sacrificed and the brains processed for staining to determine the dopaminergic lesion (TH immunohistochemistry) and localization of the electrode tip (HE histochemistry). Bilateral 6-OHDA infusion significantly decreased (70%) the number of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and increased motor time (MT), proportion of premature responding (PR), and reaction time (RT). Bilateral STN stimulation with an amplitude of 3 microA normalized 6-OHDA-induced deficits in PR and RT. Simulation with an amplitude of 30 microA reversed the lesion-induced deficits in MT and RT. Our data show for the first time that bilateral STN stimulation differentially affected the 6-OHDA-induced motor and cognitive deficits.

A spectrum of etiologies underlies the various dystonia syndromes, ranging from genetic conditions to brain injury. First-line therapy for dystonia consists of pharmacologic agents of several classes and, particularly for focal dystonia, chemodenervation therapy with botulinum toxin. Many patients with dystonia realize an inadequate response to those treatments, and for such patients whose symptoms are sufficiently troublesome, surgical treatment can be used to reduce symptoms and improve function. Previously, the ablative procedures of thalamotomy and pallidotomy were used, in which a permanent destructive lesion was made in the motor territory of the thalamus or the globus pallidus. More recently, the device-based therapy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as the preferred surgical treatment for dystonia and other movement disorders for most patients who require operative intervention. DBS uses a surgically implanted brain lead connected to an implanted neurostimulator to deliver chronic, high- frequency electrical stimulation to one of several deep nuclei. For dystonia, stimulation directed at the globus pallidus internus has been the most thoroughly studied to date. Advantages of DBS include its relatively non-destructive nature, its adjustability and reversibility, and its capacity to be used bilaterally in a safe manner. Use of DBS to treat dystonia is a rapidly evolving area, and preliminary evidence suggests that primary dystonia linked to genetic mutation, other primary dystonias, and tardive dystonic syndromes respond most dramatically to treatment with DBS, whereas secondary dystonia tends to be less responsive.", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "45", "title": "Deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "15808723", "authors": ["Mayberg, HS", "Lozano, AM", "Voon, V", "McNeely, HE", "Seminowicz, D", "Hamani, C", "Schwalb, JM", "Kennedy, SH"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neuron", "abstract": "Tourette's syndrome is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, frequently accompanied by symptoms of obsessiveness and/or compulsiveness, anxiety, and behavioral impulsivity.

Because comorbid psychiatric disorders, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder often are present, clinicians must work with affected persons and families and prioritize treatment targets based on the specific disorder-related impairment. Treatment with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may reduce tics and improve ADHD symptoms. Effective treatment of ADHD, even with stimulant medications, in most cases does not exacerbate tics.

In all electrodes tested, stimulation through at least one of the four contacts produced a medium-latency waveform with an average onset of 14 +/- 3 ms and peak at 23 +/- 4 ms. This potential typically increased in magnitude across contacts from ventral to dorsal. Within-subject comparisons of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated that the generator of the medium-latency potential was within the primary sensorimotor cortex or lateral premotor cortex ipsilateral to stimulation. The timing and topography of this potential were consistent with indirect activation of the cortex by excitation of pallido-thalamic axons that traverse the dorsal aspect of the STN. The potential evoked by stimulation through the contact used for optimal clinical effect was highly variable across electrodes and frequently different from the medium-latency potential described above, suggesting that the neuronal elements mediating the medium-latency potential were different from those that mediate the clinical effects.", "pages": "1598-604"}, {"volume": "28", "title": "Diffusion-weighted imaging-guided resection of intracerebral lesions involving the optic radiation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15805666", "authors": ["Coenen, VA", "Huber, KK", "Krings, T", "Weidemann, J", "Gilsbach, JM", "Rohde, V"], "year": "2005", "journal": "Neurosurgical review", "abstract": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is currently the preferred target for chronic electrical high-frequency stimulation in Parkinson's disease.

In this anatomopathological study, a method was applied to localize the STN in reference to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line (AC-PC line) in 12 postmortem brains of patients who died of non-neurological diseases. Their age varied from 29 to 84 years. Centers and borders of the STN were macroscopically measured in three spatial orthogonal planes in relation to the AC-PC line, and verified by light microscopy. The AC-PC distance remains almost constant during life (24.4 mm; SD 3.58). With increasing age, the center of the STN tends to move 3.9 mm cranially, 2.6 mm laterally, and 0.2 mm anteriorly.

While being the precursor to dopamine synthesis, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) can initially improve the symptoms of the disease, such as resting tremor and a poverty of movement, its effectiveness diminishes with time. Deep brain stimulation and fetal dopaminergic neuron transplantation are two available treatments for the motor complications that subsequently develop. Transplantation of fetal dopaminergic neurons has been shown to be effective at producing symptomatic relief in both animal models and patients of PD.

No universally effective pharmacological agent exists for the treatment of essential tremor, and patients differ greatly in their response to therapies, thus requiring individualised regimens. Deep brain stimulation is the best option for patients with disabling, drug-resistant essential tremor. Resting tremor in Parkinson's disease is usually not the primary disabling feature, and in most cases, levodopa/carbidopa is satisfactory for many years. Young Parkinson's patients with dominant, disabling tremor benefit from anticholinergics in addition to dopaminergic therapies. However, older Parkinson's patients with more disabling tremor may suffer from dose-dependent side effects, and deep brain stimulation should be considered.
