In this study we examine high-density ERP markers of alert responding during the fixed sequence sustained attention to response task (SART(fixed)). This paradigm has proven to be a sensitive clinical metric in patient populations with deficits in their ability to sustain attention (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). In this task subjects withhold a button press to an infrequent no-go target ('3') embedded within a predictable sequence of numbers ('1' to '9'). Our data reveal a complex pattern of effects across the trial sequence of the SART, with clear contributions from frontal and parietal cortices to sustained attentional performance. Over occipito-parietal regions, early visual attention processes were increased during trial 2 (i.e., trial in which the digit '2' was presented) and trial 3, giving rise to the so-called selection negativity (SN). Two prominent late components were manifest during trial 2: LP1 (550-800 ms) and LP2 (850-1150 ms) over occipito-parietal and central sites. We interpret the LP1 component on trial 2 as reflecting retrieval of the task goal and the subsequent LP2 as reflecting competition between the currently relevant go response and the subsequent no-go response. On trial 3, an enhanced \"no-go N2\" (250-450 ms) was seen fronto-centrally in the absence of the \"no-go P3\" that typically follows. Fronto-polar activity was also seen across all trials and may be indicative of subgoal processes to integrate the association between stimulus and goal. Prior to a lapse of attention (i.e., failure to inhibit a response to \"3\") the LP1 was significantly attenuated on the preceding trial 2 indicating a failure of anticipatory goal-directed processing. The results are discussed in terms of models of sustained attention involving frontal and parietal cortices.", "pages": "587-601"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "Visual spatial attention tracking using high-density SSVEP data for independent brain-computer communication.", "issue": "2", "pmid": "16003896", "authors": ["Kelly, SP", "Lalor, EC", "Reilly, RB", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2005", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "abstract": "The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has been employed successfully in brain-computer interface (BCI) research, but its use in a design entirely independent of eye movement has until recently not been reported. This paper presents strong evidence suggesting that the SSVEP can be used as an electrophysiological correlate of visual spatial attention that may be harnessed on its own or in conjunction with other correlates to achieve control in an independent BCI. In this study, 64-channel electroencephalography data were recorded from subjects who covertly attended to one of two bilateral flicker stimuli with superimposed letter sequences. Offline classification of left/right spatial attention was attempted by extracting SSVEPs at optimal channels selected for each subject on the basis of the scalp distribution of SSVEP magnitudes. This yielded an average accuracy of approximately 71% across ten subjects (highest 86%) comparable across two separate cases in which flicker frequencies were set within and outside the alpha range respectively. Further, combining SSVEP features with attention-dependent parieto-occipital alpha band modulations resulted in an average accuracy of 79% (highest 87%).", "pages": "587-601"}, {"volume": "13", "title": "A parametric feature extraction and classification strategy for brain-computer interfacing.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "15813401", "authors": ["Burke, DP", "Kelly, SP", "de Chazal, P", "Reilly, RB", "Finucane, C"], "year": "2005", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "abstract": "Parametric modeling strategies are explored in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis for use in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). A left/right self-paced typing exercise is analyzed by extending the usual autoregressive (AR) model for EEG feature extraction with an AR with exogenous input (ARX) model for combined filtering and feature extraction. The ensemble averaged Bereitschafts potential (an event related potential preceding the onset of movement) forms the exogenous signal input to the ARX model. Based on trials with six subjects, the ARX case of modeling both the signal and noise was found to be considerably more effective than modeling the noise alone (common in BCI systems) with the AR method yielding a classification accuracy of 52.8+/-4.8% and the ARX method an accuracy of 79.1+/-3.9 % across subjects. The results suggest a role for ARX-based feature extraction in BCIs based on evoked and event-related potentials.", "pages": "587-601"}, {"volume": "20", "title": "Behavioural and physiological impairments of sustained attention after traumatic brain injury.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "15268918", "authors": ["Dockree, PM", "Kelly, SP", "Roche, RA", "Hogan, MJ", "Reilly, RB", "Robertson, IH"], "year": "2004", "journal": "Brain research. Cognitive brain research", "abstract": "Sustaining attention under conditions of low external demand taxes our ability to stay on task and to avoid more appealing trains of thought or environmental distractions. By contrast, a stimulating, novel environment engages attention far more freely without the subjective feeling of having to override monotony. Our ability to maintain a goal-directed focus without support from the environment requires the endogenous control of behaviour. This control can be modulated by fronto-parietal circuits and this ability is compromised following traumatic brain injury (TBI) leading to increased lapses of attention. In this paper, we further explore a laboratory paradigm that we argue is particularly sensitive to sustained attention as opposed to other aspects of attentional control involving the selection and management of goals in working memory. The paradigm (fixed sequence Sustained Attention to Response Task--SARTfixed) involves withholding a key press to an infrequent no-go target embedded within a predictable sequence of numbers. We demonstrate that TBI patients in this study make disproportionately more errors than controls on this task. An analysis of response times (RTs) and EEG alpha power across the task demonstrates group differences preceding the critical no-go trial. Controls demonstrate a lengthening of RTs accompanied by desynchronization of power within the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz) preceding the no-go trial. Conversely, the TBI group showed a shortening of RTs during this period with no evidence of alpha desynchronization. These findings suggest that TBI patients may have dysfunctional alpha generators as a consequence of their injury that impairs endogenous control during the task.", "pages": "587-601"}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}, {"volume": "", "title": "", "issue": "", "pmid": "", "authors": [], "year": "", "journal": "", "abstract": "", "pages": ""}]
