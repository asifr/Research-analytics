The present study examined the temporal dynamics of electrocortical signals preceding a lapse of sustained attention. Twenty-one participants performed a continuous temporal expectancy task, which involved continuously monitoring a stream of regularly alternating patterned stimuli to detect a rarely occurring target stimulus whose duration was 40% longer. The stimulus stream flickered at a rate of 25 Hz to elicit a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP), which served as a continuous measure of basic visual processing. Increasing activity in the alpha band (8-14 Hz) was found beginning approximately 20 s before a missed target. This was followed by decreases in the amplitude of two event-related components over a short pretarget time frame: the frontal P3 (3-4 s) and contingent-negative variation (during the target interval). In contrast, SSVEP amplitude before hits and misses was closely matched, suggesting that the efficacy of ongoing basic visual processing was unaffected. Our results show that the specific neural signatures of attentional lapses are registered in the EEG up to 20 s before an error.", "pages": "8604-11"}, {"volume": "22", "title": "The effects of L-theanine on alpha-band oscillatory brain activity during a visuo-spatial attention task.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "18841456", "authors": ["Gomez-Ramirez, M", "Kelly, SP", "Montesi, JL", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Brain topography", "abstract": "Background/Objectives Ingestion of the non-proteinic amino acid L-theanine (gamma-glutamylethylamide) has been shown to influence oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band (8-14 Hz) in humans during resting electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and also during cognitive task performance. We have previously shown that ingestion of a 250-mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced tonic (background) alpha power during a demanding intersensory (auditory-visual) attentional cueing task. Further, cue-related phasic changes in alpha power, indexing the shorter-term anticipatory biasing of attention between modalities, were stronger on L-theanine compared to placebo. This form of cue-contingent phasic alpha activity is also known to index attentional biasing within visual space. Specifically, when a relevant location is pre-cued, anticipatory alpha power increases contralateral to the location to be ignored. Here we investigate whether the effects of L-theanine on tonic and phasic alpha activity, found previously during intersensory attentional deployment, occur also during a visuospatial task. Subjects/Methods 168-channel EEG data were recorded from thirteen neurologically normal individuals while engaged in a highly demanding visuo-spatial attention task. Participants underwent testing on two separate days, ingesting either a 250-mg colorless and tasteless solution of L-theanine mixed with water, or a water-based solution placebo on each day in counterbalanced order. We compared the alpha-band activity when subjects ingested L-Theanine vs. Placebo. Results We found a significant reduction in tonic alpha for the L-theanine treatment compared to placebo, which was accompanied by a shift in scalp topography, indicative of treatment-related changes in the neural generators of oscillatory alpha activity. However, L-theanine did not measurably affect cue-related anticipatory alpha effects. Conclusions This pattern of results implies that L-theanine plays a more general role in attentional processing, facilitating longer-lasting processes responsible for sustaining attention across the timeframe of a difficult task, rather than affecting specific moment-to-moment phasic deployment processes.", "pages": "8604-11"}, {"volume": "43", "title": "Differences in early sensory-perceptual processing in synesthesia: a visual evoked potential study.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "18723094", "authors": ["Barnett, KJ", "Foxe, JJ", "Molholm, S", "Kelly, SP", "Shalgi, S", "Mitchell, KJ", "Newell, FN"], "year": "2008", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "Synesthesia is a condition where stimulation of a single sensory modality or processing stream elicits an idiosyncratic, yet reliable perception in one or more other modalities or streams. Various models have been proposed to explain synesthesia, which have in common aberrant cross-activation of one cortical area by another. This has been observed directly in cases of linguistic-color synesthesia as cross-activation of the 'color area', V4, by stimulation of the grapheme area. The underlying neural substrates that mediate cross-activations in synesthesia are not well understood, however. In addition, the overall integrity of the visual system has never been assessed and it is not known whether wider differences in sensory-perceptual processing are associated with the condition. To assess whether fundamental differences in perceptual processing exist in synesthesia, we utilised high-density 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) to measure sensory-perceptual processing using stimuli that differentially bias activation of the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways of the visual system. High and low spatial frequency gratings and luminance-contrast squares were presented to 15 synesthetes and 15 controls. We report, for the first time, early sensory-perceptual differences in synesthetes relative to non-synesthete controls in response to simple stimuli that do not elicit synesthetic color experiences. The differences are manifested in the early sensory components of the visual evoked potential (VEP) to stimuli that bias both magnocellular and parvocellular responses, but are opposite in direction, suggesting a differential effect on these two pathways.

The bulk of this research has focused on either L-theanine or caffeine ingested alone (mostly the latter) and has been limited to behavioral testing, subjective rating, or neurophysiological assessments during resting. Here, we investigated the effects of both L-theanine and caffeine, ingested separately or together, on behavioral and electrophysiological indices of tonic (background) and phasic (event-related) visuospatial attentional deployment. Subjects underwent 4 d of testing, ingesting either placebo, 100 mg of L-theanine, 50 mg of caffeine, or these treatments combined. The task involved cued shifts of attention to the left or right visual hemifield in anticipation of an imperative stimulus requiring discrimination. In addition to behavioral measures, we examined overall, tonic attentional focus as well as phasic, cue-dependent anticipatory attentional biasing, as indexed by scalp-recorded alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity. We found an increase in hit rate and target discriminability (d') for the combined treatment relative to placebo, and an increase in d' but not hit rate for caffeine alone, whereas no effects were detected for L-theanine alone. Electrophysiological results did not show increased differential biasing in phasic alpha across hemifields but showed lower overall tonic alpha power in the combined treatment, similar to previous findings at a larger dosage of L-theanine alone. This may signify a more generalized tonic deployment of attentional resources to the visual modality and may underlie the facilitated behavioral performance on the combined ingestion of these 2 major constituents of tea.", "pages": "8604-11"}, {"volume": "18", "title": "Spatial attention modulates initial afferent activity in human primary visual cortex.", "issue": "11", "pmid": "18321874", "authors": ["Kelly, SP", "Gomez-Ramirez, M", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2008", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "abstract": "It is well established that spatially directed attention enhances visual perceptual processing. However, the earliest level at which processing can be affected remains unknown. To date, there has been no report of modulation of the earliest visual event-related potential component \"C1\" in humans, which indexes initial afference in primary visual cortex (V1). Thus it has been suggested that initial V1 activity is impenetrable, and that the earliest modulations occur in extrastriate cortex. However, the C1 is highly variable across individuals, to the extent that uniform measurement across a group may poorly reflect the dynamics of V1 activity. In the present study we employed an individualized mapping procedure to control for such variability. Parameters for optimal C1 measurement were determined in an independent, preliminary \"probe\" session and later applied in a follow-up session involving a spatial cueing task. In the spatial task, subjects were cued on each trial to direct attention toward 1 of 2 locations in anticipation of an imperative Gabor stimulus and were required to detect a region of lower luminance appearing within the Gabor pattern 30% of the time at the cued location only. Our data show robust spatial attentional enhancement of the C1, beginning as early as its point of onset (57 ms). Source analysis of the attentional modulations points to generation in striate cortex.

For instance, the sound and the visual percept of vehicles in traffic provide us with complementary information about the location and motion of vehicles. Here, we used high-density electrical mapping and local auto-regressive average (LAURA) source estimation to study the integration of multisensory objects in motion as reflected in event-related potentials (ERPs). A randomized stream of naturalistic multisensory-audiovisual (AV), unisensory-auditory (A), and unisensory-visual (V) \"splash\" clips (i.e., a drop falling and hitting a water surface) was presented among non-naturalistic abstract motion stimuli. The visual clip onset preceded the \"splash\" onset by 100 ms for multisensory stimuli. For naturalistic objects early multisensory integration effects beginning 120-140 ms after sound onset were observed over posterior scalp, with distributed sources localized to occipital cortex, temporal lobule, insular, and medial frontal gyrus (MFG). These effects, together with longer latency interactions (210-250 and 300-350 ms) found in a widespread network of occipital, temporal, and frontal areas, suggest that naturalistic objects in motion are processed at multiple stages of multisensory integration. The pattern of integration effects differed considerably for non-naturalistic stimuli. Unlike naturalistic objects, no early interactions were found for non-naturalistic objects. The earliest integration effects for non-naturalistic stimuli were observed 210-250 ms after sound onset including large portions of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC). As such, there were clear differences in the cortical networks activated by multisensory motion stimuli as a consequence of the semantic relatedness (or lack thereof) of the constituent sensory elements.", "pages": "8604-11"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "The role of cingulate cortex in the detection of errors with and without awareness: a high-density electrical mapping study.", "issue": "8", "pmid": "8400809", "authors": ["O'Connell, RG", "Dockree, PM", "Bellgrove, MA", "Kelly, SP", "Hester, R", "Garavan, H", "Robertson, IH", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Error-processing research has demonstrated that the brain uses a specialized neural network to detect errors during task performance but the brain regions necessary for conscious awareness of an error are poorly understood. In the present study we show that two well-known error-related event-related potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) have a differential relationship with awareness during performance of a manual response inhibition task optimized to examine error awareness. While the ERN was unaffected by the participants' conscious experience of errors, the Pe was only seen when participants were aware of committing an error. Source localization of these components indicated that the ERN was generated by a caudal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while the Pe was associated with contributions from a more anterior ACC region and the posterior cingulate-precuneus. Tonic EEG measures of cortical arousal were correlated with individual rates of error awareness and showed a specific relationship with the amplitude of the Pe. The latter finding is consistent with evidence that the Pe represents a P3-like facilitation of information processing modulated by subcortical arousal systems. Our data suggest that the ACC might participate in both preconscious and conscious error detection and that cortical arousal provides a necessary setting condition for error awareness. These findings may be particularly important in the context of clinical studies in which a proper understanding of self-monitoring deficits requires an explicit measurement of error awareness.", "pages": "8604-11"}, {"volume": "25", "title": "Optimal sustained attention is linked to the spectral content of background EEG activity: greater ongoing tonic alpha (approximately 10 Hz) power supports successful phasic goal activation.", "issue": "3", "pmid": "8229178", "authors": ["Dockree, PM", "Kelly, SP", "Foxe, JJ", "Reilly, RB", "Robertson, IH"], "year": "2007", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "Efficient executive control frequently requires the timely activation or re-activation of a task-goal to enable purposeful behaviour.

Here, we investigate the relationship between a key attention-sensitive tonic process--the alpha rhythm--and relevant phasic processes observed during a sustained attention paradigm in neurologically healthy subjects. We report that subjects with relatively higher tonic alpha power (approximately 10 Hz) show a larger-amplitude late positive ERP component that is thought to index goal activation and has been found to predict good sustained attention performance as defined by correct response patterns. Source localization results suggest that the neural generators responsible for oscillatory alpha activity, which are found primarily in the parietal and occipital lobes, are distinct from those giving rise to the late positive component.

In the context of visual spatial attention within bilateral stimulus arrays, alpha has exhibited greater amplitude over parietooccipital cortex contralateral to the hemifield required to be ignored, relative to that measured when the same hemifield is to be attended. Whether this differential effect arises solely from alpha desynchronization (decreases) over the \"attending\" hemisphere, from synchronization (increases) over the \"ignoring\" hemisphere, or both, has not been fully resolved. This is because of the confounding effect of externally evoked desynchronization that occurs involuntarily in response to visual cues. Here, bilateral flickering stimuli were presented simultaneously and continuously over entire trial blocks, such that externally evoked alpha desynchronization is equated in precue baseline and postcue intervals. Equivalent random letter sequences were superimposed on the left and right flicker stimuli. Subjects were required to count the presentations of the target letter \"X\" at the cued hemifield over an 8-s period and ignore the sequence in the opposite hemifield. The data showed significant increases in alpha power over the ignoring hemisphere relative to the precue baseline, observable for both cue directions. A strong attentional bias necessitated by the subjective difficulty in gating the distracting letter sequence is reflected in a large effect size of 2.1 (eta2 = 0.82), measured from the attention x hemisphere interaction. This strongly suggests that alpha synchronization reflects an active attentional suppression mechanism, rather than a passive one reflecting \"idling\" circuits.", "pages": "8604-11"}, {"volume": "52", "title": "Visual spatial attention control in an independent brain-computer interface.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "8083642", "authors": ["Kelly, SP", "Lalor, EC", "Finucane, C", "McDarby, G", "Reilly, RB"], "year": "2005", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel brain computer interface (BCI) design employing visual evoked potential (VEP) modulations in a paradigm involving no dependency on peripheral muscles or nerves.
