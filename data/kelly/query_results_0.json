It has been used recently to address both basic cognitive and neurophysiologic questions as well as those surrounding clinical populations. Although the components of the average VESPA response are highly reminiscent of the early components of the visual-evoked potential (VEP) when measured over midline occipital locations, the two responses are acquired in different ways and, thus, they cannot be regarded as being equivalent. To further characterize the relationship between the VESPA and the VEP and the generative mechanisms underlying them, we recorded EEG from 31 subjects in response to checkerboard-based VEP and VESPA stimuli. We found that, across subjects, the amplitudes of the VEP C1 component and the VESPA C1 component were highly correlated, whereas the VEP P1 and the VESPA P1 bore no statistical relationship. Furthermore, we found that C1 and P1 amplitudes were significantly correlated in the VESPA but not in the VEP. We believe these findings point to the presence of common generators underlying the VESPA C1 and the VEP C1. We argue further that the VESPA P1, in light of its strong relationship to the VESPA C1, likely reflects further activation of the same cortical generators. Given the lack of correlation between the VEP P1 and each of these three other components, it is likely that the underlying generators of this particular component are more varied and widespread, as suggested previously. We discuss the implications of these relationships for basic and clinical research using the VESPA and for the assessment of additive-evoked versus phase-reset contributions to the VEP.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "76", "title": "What does polarity inversion of extrastriate activity tell us about striate contributions to the early VEP?

The authors use this finding, along with other findings from fMRI-constrained source modeling, to argue that the initial component \"C1\" of the human visual evoked potential may not be generated in V1 as has been widely believed, but may instead come from V2/V3. Here, we examine the validity of this claim with respect to the full set of anatomical and electrophysiological factors comprising the unabridged \"cruciform\" model linking C1 to V1. We find that the simulations in their current form do not present a valid test of the model, nor are their results inconsistent with it. We also review non-human primate neurophysiology findings that support the C1-V1 principle, and that can and should be taken into account in assessing the validity of constrained source models of human EEG in general.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "62", "title": "Assessing the effects of caffeine and theanine on the maintenance of vigilance during a sustained attention task.", "issue": "7", "pmid": "19778621", "authors": ["Foxe, JJ", "Morie, KP", "Laud, PJ", "Rowson, MJ", "de Bruin, EA", "Kelly, SP"], "year": "2012", "journal": "Neuropharmacology", "abstract": "Caffeine and L-theanine, both naturally occurring in tea, affect the ability to make rapid phasic deployments of attention to locations in space as reflected in behavioural performance and alpha-band oscillatory brain activity (8-14 Hz). However, surprisingly little is known about how these compounds affect an aspect of attention that has been more popularly associated with tea, namely vigilant attention: the ability to maintain focus on monotonous tasks over protracted time-periods. Twenty-seven participants performed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) over a two-hour session on each of four days, on which they were administered caffeine (50 mg), theanine (100 mg), the combination, or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over fashion. Concurrently, we recorded oscillatory brain activity through high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We asked whether either compound alone, or both in combination, would affect performance of the task in terms of reduced error rates over time, and whether changes in alpha-band activity would show a relationship to such changes in performance. When treated with placebo, participants showed a rise in error rates, a pattern that is commonly observed with increasing time-on-task, whereas after caffeine and theanine ingestion, error rates were significantly reduced. The combined treatment did not confer any additional benefits over either compound alone, suggesting that the individual compounds may confer maximal benefits at the dosages employed. Alpha-band oscillatory activity was significantly reduced on ingestion of caffeine, particularly in the first hour. This effect was not changed by addition of theanine in the combined treatment. Theanine alone did not affect alpha-band activity.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Oscillatory sensory selection mechanisms during intersensory attention to rhythmic auditory and visual inputs: a human electrocorticographic investigation.", "issue": "50", "pmid": "20488247", "authors": ["Gomez-Ramirez, M", "Kelly, SP", "Molholm, S", "Sehatpour, P", "Schwartz, TH", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Oscillatory entrainment mechanisms are invoked during attentional processing of rhythmically occurring stimuli, whereby their phase alignment regulates the excitability state of neurons coding for anticipated inputs. These mechanisms have been examined in the delta band (1-3 Hz), where entrainment frequency matches the stimulation rate. Here, we investigated entrainment for subdelta rhythmic stimulation, recording from intracranial electrodes over human auditory cortex during an intersensory audiovisual task. Audiovisual stimuli were presented at 0.67 Hz while participants detected targets within one sensory stream and ignored the other. It was found that entrainment operated at twice the stimulation rate (1.33 Hz), and this was reflected by higher amplitude values in the FFT spectrum, cyclic modulation of alpha-amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling between delta phase and alpha power. In addition, we found that alpha-amplitude was relatively increased in auditory cortex coincident with to-be-ignored auditory stimuli during attention to vision. Thus, the data suggest that entrainment mechanisms operate within a delimited passband such that for subdelta task rhythms, oscillatory harmonics are invoked. The phase of these delta-entrained oscillations modulates alpha-band power. This may in turn increase or decrease responsiveness to relevant and irrelevant stimuli, respectively.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "56", "title": "The neurophysiology of human biological motion processing: a high-density electrical mapping study.", "issue": "1", "pmid": "22326943", "authors": ["Krakowski, AI", "Ross, LA", "Snyder, AC", "Sehatpour, P", "Kelly, SP", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2011", "journal": "NeuroImage", "abstract": "The neural processing of biological motion (BM) is of profound experimental interest since it is often through the movement of another that we interpret their immediate intentions. Neuroimaging points to a specialized cortical network for processing biological motion. Here, high-density electrical mapping and source-analysis techniques were employed to interrogate the timing of information processing across this network. Participants viewed point-light-displays depicting standard body movements (e.g. jumping), while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded and compared to ERPs to scrambled motion control stimuli. In a pair of experiments, three major phases of BM-specific processing were identified: 1) The earliest phase of BM-sensitive modulation was characterized by a positive shift of the ERP between 100 and 200 ms after stimulus onset. This modulation was observed exclusively over the right hemisphere and source-analysis suggested a likely generator in close proximity to regions associated with general motion processing (KO/hMT). 2) The second phase of BM-sensitivity occurred from 200 to 350 ms, characterized by a robust negative-going ERP modulation over posterior middle temporal regions bilaterally. Source-analysis pointed to bilateral generators at or near the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). 3) A third phase of processing was evident only in our second experiment, where participants actively attended the BM aspect of the stimuli, and was manifest as a centro-parietal positive ERP deflection, likely related to later cognitive processes. These results point to very early sensory registration of biological motion, and highlight the interactive role of the posterior STS in analyzing the movements of other living organisms.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "261", "title": "The N1 auditory evoked potential component as an endophenotype for schizophrenia: high-density electrical mapping in clinically unaffected first-degree relatives, first-episode, and chronic schizophrenia patients.", "issue": "5", "pmid": "22171054", "authors": ["Foxe, JJ", "Yeap, S", "Snyder, AC", "Kelly, SP", "Thakore, JH", "Molholm, S"], "year": "2011", "journal": "European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience", "abstract": "The N1 component of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) is a robust and easily recorded metric of auditory sensory-perceptual processing. In patients with schizophrenia, a diminution in the amplitude of this component is a near-ubiquitous finding. A pair of recent studies has also shown this N1 deficit in first-degree relatives of schizophrenia probands, suggesting that the deficit may be linked to the underlying genetic risk of the disease rather than to the disease state itself. However, in both these studies, a significant proportion of the relatives had other psychiatric conditions. As such, although the N1 deficit represents an intriguing candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia, it remains to be shown whether it is present in a group of clinically unaffected first-degree relatives. In addition to testing first-degree relatives, we also sought to replicate the N1 deficit in a group of first-episode patients and in a group of chronic schizophrenia probands. Subject groups consisted of 35 patients with schizophrenia, 30 unaffected first-degree relatives, 13 first-episode patients, and 22 healthy controls. Subjects sat in a dimly lit room and listened to a series of simple 1,000-Hz tones, indicating with a button press whenever they heard a deviant tone (1,500 Hz; 17% probability), while the AEP was recorded from 72 scalp electrodes. Both chronic and first-episode patients showed clear N1 amplitude decrements relative to healthy control subjects. Crucially, unaffected first-degree relatives also showed a clear N1 deficit. This study provides further support for the proposal that the auditory N1 deficit in schizophrenia is linked to the underlying genetic risk of developing this disorder. In light of recent studies, these results point to the N1 deficit as an endophenotypic marker for schizophrenia. The potential future utility of this metric as one element of a multivariate endophenotype is discussed.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "31", "title": "Prepare for conflict: EEG correlates of the anticipation of target competition during overt and covert shifts of visual attention.", "issue": "9", "pmid": "17409248", "authors": ["Kelly, SP", "Foxe, JJ", "Newman, G", "Edelman, JA"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "abstract": "When preparing to make a saccadic eye movement in a cued direction, perception of stimuli at the target location is enhanced, just as it is when attention is covertly deployed there. Accordingly, the timing and anatomical sources of preparatory brain activity accompanying shifts of covert attention and saccade preparation tend to exhibit a large degree of overlap. However, there is evidence that preparatory processes are modulated by the foreknowledge of visual distractor competition during covert attention, and it is unknown whether eye movement preparation undergoes equivalent modulation. Here we examine preparatory processes in the electroencephalogram of human participants during four blocked versions of a spatial cueing task, requiring either covert detection or saccade execution, and either containing a distractor or not. As in previous work, a typical pattern of spatially selective occipital, parietal and frontal activity was seen in all task versions. However, whereas distractor presence called on an enhancement of spatially selective visual cortical modulation during covert attention, it instead called on increased activity over frontomedial oculomotor areas in the case of overt saccade preparation. We conclude that, although advance orienting signals may be similar in character during overt and covert conditions, the pattern by which these signals are modulated to ameliorate the behavioral costs of distractor competition is highly distinct, pointing to a degree of separability between the overt and covert systems.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "30", "title": "Early spatial attentional modulation of inputs to the fovea.", "issue": "13", "pmid": "17395267", "authors": ["Frey, HP", "Kelly, SP", "Lalor, EC", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2010", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "abstract": "Attending to a specific spatial location modulates responsivity of neurons with receptive fields processing that part of the environment. A major outstanding question is whether attentional modulation operates differently for the foveal (central) representation of the visual field than it does for the periphery. Indeed, recent animal electrophysiological recordings suggest that attention differentially affects spatial integration for central and peripheral receptive fields in primary visual cortex. In human electroencephalographic recordings, spatial attention to peripheral locations robustly modulates activity in early visual regions, but it has been claimed that this mechanism does not operate in foveal vision. Here, however, we show clear early attentional modulation of foveal stimulation with the same timing and cortical sources as seen for peripheral stimuli, demonstrating that attentional gain control operates similarly across the entire field of view. These results imply that covertly attending away from the center of gaze, which is a common paradigm in behavioral and electrophysiological studies of attention, results in a precisely timed push-pull mechanism. While the amplitude of the initial response to stimulation at attended peripheral locations is significantly increased beginning at 80 ms, the amplitude of the response to foveal stimulation begins to be attenuated.", "pages": "191-9"}, {"volume": "34", "title": "Visual sensory processing deficits in patients with bipolar disorder revealed through high-density electrical mapping.", "issue": "6", "pmid": "16542856", "authors": ["Yeap, S", "Kelly, SP", "Reilly, RB", "Thakore, JH", "Foxe, JJ"], "year": "2009", "journal": "Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN", "abstract": "Etiological commonalities are apparent between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Our goal here was to assess whether early visual sensory processing in patients with bipolar disorder, as indexed by decreased amplitude of the P1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP), would show a similar deficit to that seen in those with schizophrenia.
